I got one that is via the Easter Island heads

13
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:34,208
And it was a little bit easier actually it was pretty small but great I've always had a

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
An attraction of

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Drawn to the

Yeah it is it is always nice to see Easter Island because no matter I am even if you know what's going on and

26
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,680
And how it was done as as many archaeologists and scientists do

27
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
There's still a party that just looks it doesn't go away

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
No I don't think so

140
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,751
Someone in the engineering room or like a producer is just playing a meme that has audio

150
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
It's from the movie The Thing

151
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,359

I just died when I was listening to it what I got away from it

164
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,063
Was so much more disappointing when I realized it was just a meme

165
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463

169
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
You realized instantly that is not how he say that's not how you say it

170
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:01,503
I don't think so I thought he was at nothing else has ran out of gas

171
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575

00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
It was a 75 year-old man who had cancer and a history of heart attack

190
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
Doctors believe that though he died shortly after receiving the vaccine

191
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Heart attack

192
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
If it killed him was unrelated to vaccinate

193
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
I'm certain that that

194
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,527
Assumption the doctors have a something that's going to be examined

195
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,159
And I'll go ahead and listen to doctors about issues like this not weirdos who ramble over 80s Sci-Fi movies

196
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Gazelle dumb pills

197
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
That was a real

198
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,583
That one's that is it that requires a bit more of a Titanic intellect

199
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
To to get to the bottom

200
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,495
Responsibility

201
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
Give me a little bit more than a couple of stray cases

202
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Of people

203
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Have conditions that could have

204
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,711
Not been related to the vaccine

205
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
How many doses of the vaccine worldwide have we got out so far

206
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:49,791
Okay well then

207
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
How many dogs do a little better if he does not

208
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,447
As you may recall a little while back

209
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
Someone got canned over to Infowars I believe a lot of

210
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
Goodnight

211
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Is he back

212
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Still on the lamb

213
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
Doing his show on periscope

214
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Which I can't imagine

215
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
Ever

216
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
That's where we are so close

217
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:23,583
Periscope close a couple of times to see if he's talkingshit and then I just can't you

218
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,167
Can't pull the trigger

219
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
He was fired

220
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Made

221
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
A pronouncement

222
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
And that was

223
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
Who the f*** else do you have there

224
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Harrison Smith

225
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
Harrison Smith

226
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
B h

227
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
The hours the David I was on

228
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
So he's going to have Harrison Smith house be ours the David Knight was

229
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,903
Journal hosted by

230
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,535
College

231
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
Transmission

232
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
Of the year

233
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
2020 what year

234
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Like to get your take on

235
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,919
What you think coming in the new year and what your resolutions are in the New Year

236
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
What you think our focus should be in the new year

237
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Great question

238
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Reading

239
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:20,415
Good Focus

240
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Tell me a good start

241
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,279
Get an hour away from your recording studio at Alta

242
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,887
That would be mighty tower away from everywhere

243
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,983
Harrison an hour away to

244
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Sam Smith being gay

245
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,151
Uninteresting bump on a log basically the equivalent of a cardboard cutout of a

246
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
But again

247
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
What American journalist

248
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Trying to be

249
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Is like a call-in show with a

250
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Completely neutral host

251
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
Is probably the only person

252
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
Who you might be able to like he's so boring he fits that role upgrade

253
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,375
Terms of boring a boring am from David Knight

254
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
Going to the plaza M we're still at zero but it

255
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
0.2

256
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,567
0.0 American journal page

257
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
Video cuz I was thinking about

258
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Like seeing if Alex have been hosting it and I saw it was Harrison

259
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Talking to fish in this well

260
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
But I did notice

261
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
It's a little bit

262
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
In your face

263
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Betamerica

264
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
Journals initials are the same as Alex Jones

265
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:34,143
AJ

266
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,775
I didn't realize it till I went to the website I saw those Graphics I was like this is a little bit of

267
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
A little bit much

268
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Put your name on the building

269
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,967
So we got we got some people dying of covid in the last week

270
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Some celebrities

271
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Sansom high-profile people

272
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,623
Sure and these are people that Alex needs to push back off

273
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
Whatever well Lu Pueblo

274
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
Surgery on Eminem

275
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
Read the fine print but they say he died of a heart attack

276
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Balcony something year-old

277
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,087
Dawn Wells of Marianne

278
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
Gilligan's Island

279
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Covid-19

280
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
Complication

281
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
Dumbass Alex Jones probably thought I was a documentary

282
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,751
We've all been on that island for a long time

283
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
Nice

284
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,271
They're all ungrateful and it wouldn't have been there if it weren't for that boat in the first place

285
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,623
So Alex is really playing fast and loose with the details of these situation

286
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Circular day without of Luca Light low

287
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Because he knows it's really bad

288
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
And stories like this really hard for him to spin

289
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
Basically just deny the reality of the primary strategy

290
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Buttload been elected

291
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
Did the congress representative 5th

292
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
African Louisiana but before he could be sworn in he died

293
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
At the age of 41 from covid-19

294
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
The way I was presenting the story it sounds like

295
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
Just happened to have covid related

296
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Quote surgery

297
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,319
Kevin died of a heart attack in that surgery but that is not what happened

298
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,671
He entered Monroe hospital on December 19th because of covid

299
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,279
Any condition deteriorated quickly lead to him entering the I see you on December

300
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
23rd

301
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
There he suffered a heart attack that quote

302
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
What's refractory to all resuscitation efforts

303
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
According to dr. GE ghali

304
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported quote

305
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
Ask Dad what LO had any underlying condition

306
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
That would have made his death more likely

307
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
Gally said in a text message

308
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Quote none

309
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
All covid related

310
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,039
Alex is lying to his audience about this case to make them

311
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Belt less likely to take covid-19 seriously

312
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
That's bad

313
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,719
Yeah it's for Dawn Wells you better keep her name out of his mouth

314
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,071
She was a great woman which I'm basically saying mostly because you was an alumnus

315
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Stephens College

316
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
Which is in my hometown of Columbia Missouri

317
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,471
Regularly and speak with Theatre students there

318
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,799
And everyone I knew you'd met her and spent time with her really gave me the impression

319
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
She cared a lot

320
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
About being able

321
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
How to get whatever she cooked

322
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Three students

323
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
But I always found really admirable

324
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
I've always I've grown up with a with a deep appreciation

325
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Amber Dawn Wells

326
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,879
Both as like someone who'd like to Gilligan's Island as a kid and someone

327
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Who

328
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Was tertiarily aware of

329
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
She was like

330
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Decency as an adult

331
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
Years old from all accounts

332
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,399
Including a video she posted around Christmas she was in really good health

333
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
Off until she got covid-19

334
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
Which point things went downhill fast

335
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,591
From the details that are available it does not seem outlandish to ascribe her death to covid

336
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
These are two recent deaths that are high-profile and very emotionally resonant so it's critical and important for Alex

337
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,063
To time to deny the reality of these debts to his audience

338
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
Luke letlow was only 41 years old and he just been elect

339
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Message receipt in Congress

340
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Get his life ahead of

341
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
Snatched away by covid

342
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,583
On the other side Dawn Wells was a sweetheart for most of the day the audience

343
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
The further use

344
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
The person that they had a crush on when they were children

345
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,751
Future her passing is a possibility of being like a motion Ali effect

346
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
Thing to them in a way they could be unpredictable

347
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Got to pretend that all this is bulshit

348
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
Yeah I mean it

349
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
How do humans Act

350
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
This despicable

351
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Jennifer wunder

352
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Like what

353
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,951
But you know when that Whitney says that you can look into the abyss that old meet your

354
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
When you can look into the abyss

355
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
That you know the m

356
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,143
The character and then the abyss looks back

357
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
You don't deny a pandemic is not difference

358
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Is that difference

359
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
I don't know there's a small part of me that I think

360
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
Suspected Alex realizes like I can't go back

361
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,039
It's too I've already gone too far down this road no matter what I have to

362
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
To commit to this

363
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Is going back look

364
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
So dumb what happens if I say

365
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:16,767
Whoops fear I've got like what is a 1060 been like you know what

366
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
I was wrong about 9/11

367
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,703
What kind of a career could he possibly have you spent so much time insisting 9/11 was an inside job and all this

368
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,519
If you did that now or at any point like

369
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Do you know what

370
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
We got to take over real seriously guys

371
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
You're not assigned to slavery

372
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,479
You should get the vaccine double back

373
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
It's just so weird you know cuz you when you look at the history of capitalism and you see how many times people have had the choice between

374
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Continuing to make money

375
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
We're doing the responsible thing and saving lives

376
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
It's always been saving lives

377
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
Capitalism that's what I've always

378
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
I wonder I mean like

379
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,167
You know you're putting it in terms of like

380
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Making money

381
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
His whole

382
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Career

383
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
Torpedo

384
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
Already on the way to that happening Slowly by 1000

385
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Some Cuts mostly are in the shape of a

386
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,111
It would be a disaster for him

387
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
Consolidate like a lot of like

388
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
He probably would like

389
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
To be his leg

390
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah I just

391
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
I just

392
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,608
Don't know how you could be in his situation and not

393
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
See the writing on the wall and

394
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Secret

395
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Control how you

396
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
You go out

397
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,800
You know narcissism mother

398
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,616
I wish I could argue with that but that's

399
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
It's one hundred percent correct nevermind

400
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,040
It's just the feelings of like and confirm my ennui

401
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,600
I think about how many times he's been like back against

402
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
The wall and been able to wiggle out of thing

403
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
You can't like

404
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Something this big

405
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
You can't really do that

406
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Like a duck

407
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
What when you're

408
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
Actively calling for the overthrowing of

409
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Election

410
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
And

411
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Denying

412
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Large

413
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
He'll pandemic killing thousands of people today

414
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Like you can't just be like whoop

415
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
I buy West on that one

416
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Yeah and we

417
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
At this point you have

418
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
To reframe it in the in

419
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
Almost borderline

420
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
This is

421
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Ultimate

422
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Expression of class Warfare

423
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
Poor people are dying it rates

424
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
Infinitely higher

425
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,608
That's what this is like that we can't even talk about it.

426
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,448
Alex to try and approach it would have the air of populism

427
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
I certainly

428
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
Oh well but they do want the poor to Daiso

429
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
So you're saying like denying

430
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,968
Pandemic is really monstrous and how do people do that

431
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,296
I think you're selling Alex or he can be worse

432
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
Arresting people now

433
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
They go into the empty Hospital someone be very very clear

434
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
You need to go show the parking lot empty

435
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,608
You need to show the receiving area Fe that shoot a time-lapse

436
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Did I tell you to leave leave

437
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,288
We've got multiple videos of people being arrested in the US

438
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
And the UK

439
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
When I go to the hospital

440
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
Privacy

441
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
I know it is certainly not

442
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,976
Is referring to I don't know what

443
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,328
United States person he's talking about but there's definitely a person in the UK

444
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
I need Debbie here

445
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,448
Text Suzanne anti lockdown protesters showed up at the hospital and recorded people

446
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Forgive me in advance

447
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
Gloucester Shire

448
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Royal Hospital

449
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
She got arrested for that video

450
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,112
From now on I'm just mispronouncing places

451
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
Carter

452
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,232
2021 is the year of me leaning YouTube

453
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Place names

454
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,912
Hey come on the UK won't even be the UK you won't even need to remember how to pronounce United Kingdom it's going to be over

455
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:12,288
Oh yeah she was videotaping patient

456
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
So we're waiting to see doctors.

457
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,384
Which is a serious breach of confidentiality and privacy

458
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,480
This is the case that I was referring to so when he says that he doesn't think

459
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
The doing what that person is doing is a violation of Hippo he is

460
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
Absolutely wrong

461
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
The person seeking Medical Care

462
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
He better like

463
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,768
Like seriously hope people don't follow through with that

464
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
And yell infowars.com in the video cuz if they do I would be in trouble

465
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,824
People attribute their crimes to infowars.com

466
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,712
Money for people who yell stuff at rally is gone.

467
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,576
He doesn't think are illegal but probably are Erv bombers screamed out

468
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:01,696
Bill Clinton was a rapist before the RV exploded I think we have a little bit more of a

469
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
So

470
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
Alex gets back to talk

471
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
Going about demons

472
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Sure

473
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Consilium

474
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
Demon face

475
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
How to run to

476
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
Killer level demon that's about as bad as they are

477
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Satan

478
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Call Milo open Damon look at him

479
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Open demon

480
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
Open

481
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
They've got the look

482
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
They got the look

483
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Is that

484
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
Is that a term that I don't know open demons

485
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Even though you know it's a

486
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
It's hard around

487
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
You know anywhere from like

488
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:54,432
And that 10 to 15 you're going to have to come out as a demon to your parents and it's going to be brutal.

489
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
Get to go to demon

490
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,368
I kind of enjoyed Alex's

491
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Continuing

492
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,440
Insistence that he can see demons in people

493
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
If taken not as a

494
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
The joke it's really scary

495
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,120
It implies something deeply Disturbed what's the look

496
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
I don't know

497
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
Whatever Alex doesn't like

498
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,800
Have to do something to do with political beliefs

499
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
Political beliefs

500
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:29,248
Can change the way you look okay that makes sense

501
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
A lot clearer to me

502
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
Over that because he does save the people without discernment to camps

503
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Discernment that word

504
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
Speaking of discernment

505
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Sure Alex has it

506
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
Bucket loads

507
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:49,472
Show me go back to Robert are the rest your calls with the big news

508
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
In Georgia what you should have done

509
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
Those are sitting in the same thing

510
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,272
Same fraud again and if we let him do it they'll do it again

511
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,624
Alex hasn't gotten the memo to ixnay on the Lynnwood

512
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,768
Even beyond that bring up Lynnwood by name

513
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:18,656
I think it's a bad idea I think it's good for anybody

514
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
I would say no

515
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Everyone

516
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
Stop mentioning Sidney Powell

517
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
We stopped

518
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:29,152
We don't want to talk about Krakens anymore I don't look good

519
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,992
Don't like how it seems like everybody can get away with

520
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
Just kind of like

521
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
Letting the detritus fall off the back of the ship

522
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,392
You know I hate texting me Powell can just

523
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,744
Bee drone that she has The Boat Leaves and Trump and everybody on the boat or fine

524
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
No she should take the boat down with her

525
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
It seems like

526
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Cause and effect

527
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Would lead to that

528
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,776
Hey I don't know constantly surprised

529
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,848
Throw city power off the boat were like well the boats Finance

530
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Electrician debate on that boat

531
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Maybe that makes more sense

532
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Speaking about SWAT you know a lot about

533
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Alex

534
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
No

535
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Well yes

536
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Woodmore

537
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Actually

538
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,336
Guess how many boats are hutan

539
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,688
Group that would have a lot of

540
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
May not have eggs

541
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,344
A group that may not have existed

542
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
What happened

543
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:49,280
Glycocalyx definitely.

544
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
I got nothing

545
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
Alright

546
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Is the population of the planet

547
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Sure

548
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
Machine

549
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
Snoo

550
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Preacher

551
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,480
Now that wasn't going to work I don't know

552
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
Bible says they're going to try to do it instead of

553
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
Does the bible say that

554
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:23,328
That's what happened with Atlantis I believe the Disney movie Atlantis

555
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,472
Even the Disney movie say that like the elites were trying to become robot Immortals

556
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,568
Or whatever like they were already robot Immortals in the Disney movie

557
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Okay yeah

558
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Maybe I mean

559
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,968
There's some Assassin's Creed in here I think with Michael j.fox

560
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
I just a guy just think that's

561
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
That's just true

562
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Alex

563
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
Is broker in prison one day

564
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Finally get to

565
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,560
I pick up the phone across from the plexiglass or no

566
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
You got your little prison

567
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,168
Clan of your other half I want to know

568
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Do you think Atlantis is real

569
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,616
We had a lot of talk about only

570
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Only f****** question

571
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,064
Oh yeah we talked about this bunch I love Atlanta

572
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
That's all you love I think it's a wonder

573
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,440
Because I don't have that time growing up in the island

574
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,768
The call of the island so strong

575
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
If you will

576
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
I would

577
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Never

578
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Argue that it

579
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,216
50

580
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
I love

581
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,568
Thinking about it I like the ideas I like a lot of the

582
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
Themes that have come from it sure

583
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
What would you think it was

584
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
Worried

585
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Santorini

586
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
Santorini that's where I don't know

587
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,856
I do a lot of people say a lot of different things

588
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
I think it's

589
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,792
I think most people assume that they meant the Mediterranean in the beginning and then everybody the world got bigger and they're like oh that's

590
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:03,936
It's not going to look good so it's probably over by the plateau of Leng

591
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
From lovecraft's dream cycle

592
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,592
Alex in the past

593
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,384
Has asserted

594
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
That

595
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Did the Trump

596
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
What are the kids

597
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Trump's kids

598
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
Yeah after Alex

599
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
To investigate Dominion

600
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
And Alex

601
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,440
Play uncover for SEC filings

602
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
State of China

603
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
Had given Dominion

604
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,840
Four hundred million dollars or something along those lines

605
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
Yes they did say they discovered

606
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:38,496
We've talked about this already on a past episode but spoiler alert that was a qanon posts

607
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
That's Alex I found

608
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
And you taking credit for

609
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
He's still claiming

610
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
Did Trump's Untold Hellyeah

611
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
What crazy is the White House

612
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
By one of the Trump Sons

613
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
Arizona they said

614
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
Get the money

615
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
And so I went and hired a company

616
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
3 weeks

617
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
LLC

618
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
In

619
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
And the 400 million on October 7th

620
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
This year

621
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
2020

622
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Bye

623
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
Communist Party

624
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
So yeah

625
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:32,000
Not given up on that narrative

626
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,328
It's just sad to look at because I think what what's

627
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
The Dominion and the doc

628
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Documents and stuff

629
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:45,056
Thompson sent me on a mission

630
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
What

631
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,920
What is satyr about this in his chest out about a thing that

632
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Really didn't happen

633
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Bored

634
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
No

635
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,856
So you take some number of calls on the show I will give it up

636
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Alex

637
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
On this rock

638
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,208
For winning the bronze at the Nagano Olympics

639
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,000
Which you also totally did yes

640
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,560
He set out to take more calls and hitch

641
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,888
I don't know if they fix the phone lines are is coincidence

642
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
But there weren't any big f*** ups

643
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Send calls

644
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,008
Like it actually worked kind of Patrol

645
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288
Largely boring

646
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
This one guy

647
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Does Colin

648
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
I want to talk about handsome

649
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
Sanitizer

650
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:27,552
This here for that conversation I would like to hand sanitizer conversations

651
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Who's me out because

652
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
This is just a clip of like why does Alex ask people questions

653
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,232
Hand sanitizers

654
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,840
Matthew citrate New superbug Scientist warrant

655
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,400
Lowers your fertility

656
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
Explain that

657
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,616
Well what happens is it messes up your hormones

658
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
Because of the

659
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
Antibacterial

660
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
Good bacteria is on your body

661
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
Actually heals you

662
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,880
And it's actually

663
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
This is bacteria

664
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,744
And Bill Gates knows that studies that he loves you though

665
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:15,168
I don't know why you didn't weird at all I don't know why he asks people questions immediately interrupted

666
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,496
I mean that was a terrible answer that deserved interrupting

667
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
I don't disagree

668
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,992
So Alex is operating there at the end of old disproven scientific

669
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:35,648
In 2016 researchers examined the previously accepted ideas about the ratio of human cells to bacteria in the body

670
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,952
Anytime there's a serious lack of backing

671
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
For what it been up to that point

672
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
Considered conventional thinking

673
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,168
Previously was accepted that is possible that microorganisms outnumbered human cells 12:50 in our body

674
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,800
These researchers were able to trace this back solely to an estimate from a 1972 paper

675
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
An American journalist

676
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
Clinical nutrition

677
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,432
Examining assumptions made back then and taking the more scientific

678
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
These researchers arrived at a percentage of

679
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
3% of your body weight is back

680
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Materia

681
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
In terms of pure numbers

682
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,648
They found the person approximately 1 to 1 ratio

683
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
Of bacteria human cells

684
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000
In most adult bodies but it's still only

685
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
3% of your house waiting for you to be like

686
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,704
Sit back to Pliny the Elder and also it turns on Rapids

687
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,520
We we learned a lot today this is just stupid or Alex

688
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,056
Just trying to scare his audience and sound

689
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,432
I'm smart there's definitely reasons why people shouldn't over do it without my back to bacterial hand soap

690
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
Sanitizer

691
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
Just for the sake of

692
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
Get off you don't want to

693
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
Liquid was he never take antibiotic

694
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Never

695
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Unwise

696
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:44,000
Don't like people who live people like this shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the benefits of the future

697
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,840
If you're telling me that hand sanitizer did then you can't have anything

698
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
You can't have any type biotic

699
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
You can have

700
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,216
Probiotics you can't have your pills you can't have any of this s***

701
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
Because you read all things are the same

702
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
Yeah I can't eat yogurt

703
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
So

704
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,968
I think I ought to be fine with it for now maybe not

705
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
It's tough to say

706
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Although

707
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
I would like

708
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
Can just slowly be eaten alive by a foot fungus that would be in

709
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
That could never happen

710
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
He takes his vitamins

711
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
It's good to washer

712
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,632
You just because some people might have some bacteria that your body doesn't like

713
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,496
With your wife or people you know and I'll see we all make each other stronger

714
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,800
More bacteria is better God bless you

715
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,152
You have all the vitamins and minerals you need

716
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Communicable diseases

717
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Replicate

718
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
Bacteria can take over if you're healthy

719
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Wow

720
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,696
Irresponsible you can pray out disease

721
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
Christ

722
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,536
Prayer and vitamins

723
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,728
Bulleya

724
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
I hate

725
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,056
Boys out of the park with science

726
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
On this episode

727
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Pigweed

728
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
Why do you think that

729
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
Why do you think that

730
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,160
How can you say that out loud

731
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,232
It's not true it is not

732
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
True

733
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
Just Dance

734
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,656
We're actually more genetically similar to rats

735
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,496
And pigs than the thing that we literally directly evolved

736
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
We're more similar to stick

737
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
The New York weather

738
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
Fine whatever

739
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,736
We are shockingly close to a lot of animals

740
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
Because there are a lot of

741
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
Things that are in

742
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,928
Common with us an animal animal

743
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
We are here.

744
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:57,888
It's diagonal common ancestor way way way way way back and a lot of those.

745
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,936
About 4,000

746
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,288
A lot of booze the DNA a lot of it does the same thing

747
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,992
But then certain mutations and then such can then

748
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,856
What's more survivable in any given environment within kind of win out over time

749
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,416
Those jeans would continue to propagate

750
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
Until the cycle happens all over again and over and over and over again for billions of years right then

751
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,472
So Alex is talking to this caller another color and

752
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
It turns out that

753
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
I think the globalist have another plan

754
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:42,688
That we didn't know about it might be playing these I don't know what plan this is anymore

755
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,016
In their plan is The Hunger Games

756
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
People see that

757
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
Natural Woman

758
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
Talking about the

759
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
Actually

760
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Predictive programming

761
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
Will plan that you and one

762
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
Hunger Games Mario

763
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
Biological diversity assessment

764
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,680
Report put out in the late 70s

765
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
2.0

766
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
In that it says

767
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Bring back

768
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Games

769
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
Olympics

770
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
System

771
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,648
Rural areas that have no technology or they live in the Smart City

772
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
We control

773
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
Human sacrifice

774
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
At these games

775
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,840
Floating fortresses

776
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
With you and Truth everyone will be disarmed

777
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,192
Mobile mobile

778
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Horses

779
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,568
Captain America will be delivered

780
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
I would say I have the Winter Soldier

781
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:49,760
F****** tired of the globalist having so many plans

782
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
Pick one and stick to it God damn

783
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:58,464
This is why they're ten years behind. Just finished one

784
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,864
A weird dad Mohave every every week There's a new thing you doesn't the garage

785
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,960
Take me back when I was trying to write short stories like I did

786
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
F*** it I'm done

787
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,824
Yeah hey girl. How your plan was orderly

788
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,128
Killing off of people within a few years

789
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,272
And then if Alex is too good at his job than they're playing with a supervisor that's not very good

790
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,672
What size fun for the globalist

791
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
They want to bring about

792
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
The Hunger Game

793
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Right

794
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
Which doesn't seem like

795
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Extermination

796
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
It seems like

797
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
A situation where people are living

798
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
Destitution

799
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
Well the elite

800
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
Slither opulently

801
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,288
And then people kill for entertainment

802
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,360
Movies but I did see Battle Royale

803
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
So

804
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,432
Like to figure it's the same thing

805
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,320
Slightly more story Maybe

806
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,624
I don't know I would say

807
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,024
Why doesn't he ever develop like I want him to just really dig into the weeds and start doing what I like.

808
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,120
Give me this popular bulshit that's written for young adults

809
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:13,472
Give me hard sci-fi tell me that it's going to be like a Heinlein book order

810
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
Or f******

811
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:19,104
Worried about childhood

812
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,920
That's what it's all about Neal Stephenson now

813
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,784
That's 2023 she's got a Rebrand

814
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,136
Get some sci-fi helicopter where I'm at

815
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
Amy needs to find a new test

816
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,048
I'm so sick and tired of this s***

817
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
Yeah it's just

818
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
Just like I want a coherent

819
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Like

820
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Narrative

821
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Something

822
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,752
The bad guys are supposed to be working

823
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
On the behalf of the fuc

824
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Walking devil

825
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
He's not a new character

826
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Whom you can see

827
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,711
Yeah you can see him open.

828
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
If they're open they're open

829
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Close demons difference

830
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
Do rabbits talk

831
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
I would say

832
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,975
I'm studying on 27 years the plan shouldn't keep change

833
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,071
Here's the bottom line I'm playing games here are playing Hunger Games

834
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,911
David Icke talks about The Hunger Games stuff all the time

835
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,983
Alex is just ripping off David I cuz he's really into

836
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Damn right now

837
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
But yeah it's more annoying

838
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
In terms of like

839
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
I can't even I can't even trust Alex

840
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
2

841
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
Be pretending

842
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
Serious about

843
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
Yeah

844
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
It's just

845
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
This is where I'm at like

846
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,831
Oh yeah sure okay

847
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,135
I bet ya

848
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,999
Reading the first third of a new novel every week

849
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
And never finishing it and it's

850
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Infuriating

851
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
It's be infuriating

852
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,727
It's kind of scary scary like this

853
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:57,151
Manno razor years

854
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:03,551
Lock up your wife and children now

855
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,351
DJ right. Someone asked you right now

856
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:22,751
What do you do about it

857
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,951
Living on your knees on your feet

858
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:48,351
No it's all been planned A Center once Center twice

859
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:11,135
Over the wall we all left our own

860
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:15,231
PCS down

861
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,863
And make no mistake

862
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,727
The Rothschilds and Rockefellers the Bill Gates's in the world they will go into the fire as well

863
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,079
And their destruction be the most painful

864
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,407
They will be Giants

865
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
Every man and every woman

866
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,015
Will be

867
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,599
Forced to kneel in front of God

868
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
I just

869
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,159
I find myself like

870
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:49,535
While I'm sitting here not being able to take Alex seriously about just about anything he's saying

871
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,351
Performative

872
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
Soaring Heights song lyrics

873
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,959
But it's also in the context of his show basically terrorist

874
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,359
People like ramped-up if you've been dying anyway

875
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
Pair that with

876
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
Forced religious imagery it's like

877
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
I don't

878
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
I can't stand the stuff like

879
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,087
I don't think I've ever

880
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
Encountered in my life a time when like

881
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Religiosity match

882
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
With

883
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,999
Like open violence

884
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Is it good

885
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,071
Yeah

886
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,911
Historically just going back through my Rolodex

887
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,751
Second Crusade that was no that was a good one

888
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,311
Fiskars and didn't go well

889
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
No not usually bad

890
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Yeah

891
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
You can have to go to that

892
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
I know this is performative and I know that Alex

893
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
He doesn't even

894
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
He's

895
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
You think this is a joke

896
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,183
Yeah like he's f****** with his audience

897
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
Like

898
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
And I can tell because like listen to this

899
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
President

900
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
Pretender Electric

901
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Joe Biden

902
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
But he's a nobody

903
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
He will be brought low

904
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
He will be broken

905
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
He will

906
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
The Almighty

907
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
God will tell him the door is closed

908
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
You are dumb as hell

909
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
Cool then leave them alone till then

910
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,351
All right but nobody knows he's damned to hell

911
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Cool

912
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
He just wants to take you where they

913
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
Your lucky stars

914
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Everyday that you're not

915
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Joe Biden

916
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Bill Gates

917
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
How many of these people

918
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
Prepared for their own annihilation

919
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,271
They're just trying to drag us down below

920
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,319
Think about your phone calls here

921
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:59,839
Alright I'm really worried about the food goes up and died 6:40 a.m.

922
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,703
Today is going to burn in the fires of hell

923
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:11,103
Ginger really care about this but it's all an act

924
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,199
And get you excited

925
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,759
Joe Biden burning in hell

926
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,159
Anyways what are we up to

927
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,719
Aerosmith coming to the Pavilion

928
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
Yeah this is so stupid

929
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
What do you think

930
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
He's a good reason to overthrow the

931
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:42,335
Like taxation without representation is one from American history

932
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,383
Thursdays are usually pretty rough

933
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,967
You just got to take a nap at work

934
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,623
In terms of Labor he's a good one sure got pretty sure Haiti had the right idea

935
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,415
I would I would say to that

936
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
It doesn't both better

937
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,999
Write this caller is going

938
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Okay

939
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:05,375
This color wants to overthrow the federal government

940
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
Small

941
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,727
And I really just called you because we're just getting some

942
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
Sick and tired of the man

943
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,311
I had to go to my girlfriend's crisp

944
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
Play Celebration with mask on

945
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,943
60 away from everybody

946
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
This area is ready

947
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
To not have

948
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:27,903
The federal government anymore everyone

949
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
Mask off

950
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,951
Bacterial pneumonia

951
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,535
Privilege trimana just because they think they're nurses

952
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,071
They think they know everything

953
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,911
You do most of the nurses

954
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
Play must be really young nurses

955
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,287
One is her grandma and one of them is like

956
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,871
30 year old woman I don't know they're both pretty liberal they both

957
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
They're making everybody

958
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,575
Alex's realized like oh no

959
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,903
I've set out this talking point that all the nurses are against

960
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,975
The vaccine for these two nurses are 48

961
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:07,583
Be young oh wait they're not young though they must be really liberal because that's how they wanted

962
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
Express their power

963
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:15,263
Don't go to the Christmas party

964
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:23,967
Psychic it's like you go to that side you're going to like this

965
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Going to lose

966
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,783
F*** off man

967
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
And in order to

968
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,159
To trick you from realizing that they've been wrong about a bunch of things Natalie this Mentalist

969
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
We'll switch

970
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,511
Topix Oakland

971
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Is in gender roles

972
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
I'm not putting women down

973
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
Some women

974
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Marsh

975
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,959
Smartest man they are

976
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,383
4%

977
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,967
Men don't bow with my baby domesticated slug

978
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
But their wives and girlfriends work for

979
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,831
And and women haven't talked to comply with the sister

980
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,695
Bonded by women

981
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
This is the Bible says will happen in the end times

982
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
Men's fall

983
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
We're not

984
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
L

985
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
Holyshit

986
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
While

987
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
Wild stuff

988
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,895
Omigod omigod

989
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,919
We believe that

990
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
That's insane

991
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:33,087
That's an insane thing you just said you slapped in the face that's outrageous

992
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Bye

993
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Leading

994
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,439
Are f****** everything up but it's not their fault

995
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
Men should put them in their place

996
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,143
Just a just a just wait just come out and be like I don't think we should have given the right to vote just say it

997
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:50,239
I would bet that you would think that's creeping communism or he around

998
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,335
Why would you give women the right to vote they're just going to vote the way their husbands do

999
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
Duh you just going to double all

1000
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,479
Listing boats already don't even need to worry about it

1001
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,831
So it was shocking

1002
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:11,231
Everybody

1003
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,047
Women's Health

1004
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,191
We have one last call are here on this New Year's Eve

1005
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Interesting idea about what

1006
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,055
To do

1007
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
On the six

1008
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
Cuz I doing this rally right

1009
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,687
Down in DC has got a novel idea

1010
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,807
March on DC or the occupation of

1011
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
DC

1012
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,647
I think that you I'm going to talk to all

1013
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
Cajun Navy and all these

1014
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
People that did

1015
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Parade

1016
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
For the past

1017
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,047
324 mud

1018
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,631
We need to have every single one of those people

1019
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
Plug up

1020
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
The Potomac

1021
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:56,543
Because you know everything outside

1022
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,127
Like and I can set out some Facebook

1023
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,807
The Facebook post going to Cajun Navy

1024
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
Yes

1025
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,927
I am fine with these plans these are my favorite plan

1026
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,463
Pick something stupid

1027
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
And stick to it

1028
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:20,863
Like it's just going to inconvenience you guys each other

1029
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,143
Yes

1030
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,751
Somebody's going to accuse a boat big antifa everybody's going to drown

1031
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
Stupid

1032
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:34,943
I don't like being taken over by the dumbest people on the planet they had this plan is too complicated for y'all

1033
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
It's unfortunate that I want to like

1034
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,575
Almost parental wage

1035
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:45,695
And here's how you overthrow the government guys without the Terrible

1036
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,327
So I would say that their New Year's Eve day show and

1037
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
The New Year's Day show themselves

1038
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
Really

1039
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,775
Special there's not really a feeling of like new beginnings

1040
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
No does ask

1041
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,615
On 31st

1042
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,455
For people to call in and say they're there their New Year's resolutions

1043
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,039
I'm sure not much meaningful s*** there but

1044
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Overthrow the government

1045
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
So we get to the first

1046
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
Another show

1047
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:25,119
It's not like a New Year's show

1048
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Except

1049
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,447
An amazing roster of guests

1050
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,007
And Alec realizing

1051
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
It's probably going to be a possum

1052
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,311
Select

1053
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,895
Exclusive information

1054
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
What major explosive information

1055
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,039
Since the election

1056
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,599
President-trump

1057
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
Across the country

1058
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,463
You got to stop saying that it's better than other areas

1059
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Basalt

1060
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Radar then

1061
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Jerry West

1062
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,327
We can really give you the serious pass

1063
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:00,959
But it is a narrowing window

1064
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
Indiana Jones

1065
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,055
Raiders of Lost Ark Wiki rolls under

1066
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
The wall

1067
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,871
Lower down and closes

1068
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,663
Races through and grabs a sweater

1069
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
I mean

1070
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,783
Robin Hood shot

1071
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,111
Arrow and splitting

1072
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
As a little break

1073
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,519
A little unnecessarily brag

1074
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:39,359
I'm sorry for screaming but that was just too much I was just too much I've heard

1075
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,503
There is something nonsensical about him being like all right I'm going to come up with an example of it

1076
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
Incredibly difficult thing

1077
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,319
By the way I've got a bunch

1078
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,599
The time so easily

1079
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,903
God damn it I hate him so much

1080
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
But how could someone

1081
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:57,023
I've listened to him so you can do too much set

1082
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:02,143
Forrest Gump your way I'm Robinhood to I've got bad news for Alec

1083
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
It's about

1084
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,191
Trump's agility

1085
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
Peace Corps

1086
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:11,359
Don't think he's going to be diving under any doors and a bullwhip

1087
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,687
That stand thing that he does help him look like a weird f****** horse

1088
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
I think you might get

1089
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,039
He's not going to roll

1090
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
So all this is probably

1091
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
My second

1092
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,927
Favorite thing on this this January 1st

1093
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,975
Episode I will say what we end with

1094
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,255
Fantastic

1095
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,303
Be worth the episode on its own

1096
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,095
I'm not talking about Rodger Stone

1097
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
What's this

1098
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
This was a

1099
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
Little mod

1100
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
Search for me in a way that I enjoy

1101
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
But it's good

1102
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
But it's a little

1103
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,567
The social Engineers have noticed that most people

1104
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,895
When they're part of a crime

1105
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
When they're part of something corrupt

1106
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
When they

1107
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
When I get manipulated to doing

1108
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Something wrong

1109
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,647
Don't say they're wrong

1110
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,207
They decide to get even more delusional

1111
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,023
And to sign on to even more excesses

1112

You specific

1122
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
Get online scams

1123
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,927
Get us back out most popular

1124
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
There's Lotsa

1125
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,887
The Royal bloodline of Prince Abu

1126
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,191
Wants to give you $1,000

1127
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,799
He's got money locked up million to this Bank

1128
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,895
But he is unable to get it out of whatever

1129
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,455
If you'll just give him $1,000

1130
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,759
You will be given $20,000

1131
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,063
And when you

1132
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
Give him the thousand

1133
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:02,463
Yeah well he's ready to give you the more money but he needs 5,000 more

1134
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,511
But now he's going to give you a half a million

1135
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,119
And usually most people once they're giving 1000

1136
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
They give

1137
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
The larger amount

1138
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,311
And then if you do

1139
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Pull up at your house

Royal Road

1142
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,551
Affection graciously

1143
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,831
Let's make a phone call

1144
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,647
He will greatly thank you from Nigeria

1145
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
And some people

1146
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,255
$300,000 principal

1147
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
50 million

1148
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:48,799
DC and talk show host said I've been offered $100,000 by Nigerian

1149
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,591
5000

1150
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,687
Are you joking

1151
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
Part of this

1152
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,343
And he said screw you you're just jealous I'm going to get all this money and then he actually got

1153
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,951
As opposed to the other possibilities

1154
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,743
I'm

1155
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
Certain Alex

1156
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:15,679
Has to be talkin about himself there's the only the only person who could be talking about it on Creative about like

1157
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:22,079
Gcn radio host

1158
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,151
His buddy Ted Anderson would hire a guy and have him

1159
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:30,015
Yeah the host email scam

1160
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,551
I don't know if I

1161
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,879
Ever heard of anybody having a car pull up

1162
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
And in person

1163
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,487
Scammers show up

1164
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:45,887
They know that that would probably be a sting it would be a bad idea

1165
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,447
Is primarily scamming over long distance

1166
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,751
Maybe even another country

1167
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
This

1168
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
This is this is a bad idea

1169
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,103
I wouldn't do that if I were them

1170
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
This is not this is

1171
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
Isn't something that Escalade

1172
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
X2 like

1173
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
Let's do this in person

1174
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
Because

1175
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
There's no reason to you understand that that would be the only way that could work is if

1176
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:14,047
First game of the scammers was possible where they're like holyshit we're going to get so much money out of this guy we got

1177
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:14,815
How to show up at a

1178
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
His place

1179
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,655
Yes that would be the only

1180
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Yeah

1181
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:26,079
I actually did some looking into this I read the page on the FBI's website about this scam like Aunt like

1182
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,615
You're the warning signs and stuff

1183
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,431
I read a couple other things I can't find any indication

1184
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,247
It escalates to a guy showing up at your house

1185
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,551
No that doesn't

1186
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
It seems like a different

1187
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:43,999
We should hire somebody to show up announcer just said Nigerian prince well

1188
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
I got a

1189
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,863
He does always a prince a boo boo and I know that that

1190
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,191
Fields racist

1191
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,495
It feels like that could just be a name he's making up

1192
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:58,847
But he always uses that name very specific the name of

1193
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,455
Well I mean isn't it from Aladdin

1194
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:08,063
It's not the insult name that Jafar he calls him Prince Abu

1195
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,087
Odesza

1196
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:14,463
I didn't realize that I don't mean that in a long time

1197
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,487
Yeah yeah

1198
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,535
So then he

1199
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
Great insults his name like this

1200
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
Interesting

1201
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
Easy for me

1202
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,007
I don't know a long time

1203
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,823
Makes sense that something would come from a movie

1204
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,127
All right we've we've sorted this out

1205
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,407
Alex is almost certainly been

1206
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
The scam by that

1207
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,223
I don't know about the

1208
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,015
The car though

1209
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,575
That seems that seems like you might have just dropped

1210
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,367
His embellish

1211
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:46,975
Kind of Storytelling style but everything else seems very suspiciously at

1212
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
So this vaccine

1213
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
You know what it is

1214
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
The mark of the beast

1215
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,423
This is the whole world government agenda

1216
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,727
This is the mark of the beast is it the tracking system

1217
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
This is it

1218
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,311
And yes crop has failed

1219
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,871
Critical juncture

1220
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Nicholas you

1221
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,919
He has gone long

1222
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
Cuz I made that up

1223
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,743
Trump won the election the Democrats are trying to steal it they want him out of the way

1224
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,047
Because Joe Biden is 509 Force

1225
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Okay

1226
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:28,447
Yeah all that stuff about like Trump is putting out the Pfizer vaccine

1227
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:33,567
Bill Gates making all that stuff up

1228
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,967
The way to find a way to support Trump even though he was in favor of the vaccine

1229
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
That I can really threat

1230
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:44,575
The needle and now I look like an idiot so I pretend I never said that but

1231
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,975
I do have to I mean my callers do know that I said the drop was trying to play 3D chess or 4D chess with the vaccine

1232
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:55,327
So now I got to be like all well Trump is wrong on this one so he gave us the mark of the

1233
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
I love it

1234
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
Sewed up

1235
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
I just love how stupid it is

1236
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:10,431
Literally literally immediately after he's talking about how people will double down it rather than admit

1237
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,735
They got, he's literally doing

1238
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
Except he called himself

1239
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:21,439
He is both the recipient and the center of the United State of email

1240
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:29,631
You know which also wouldn't surprise me too much of that was true in real life as well metaphorically or literally

1241
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Damn email

1242
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,727
Hey I think that

1243
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
Find

1244
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
Difficult to understand what

1245
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
You gain by having

1246
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
When Trump in office

1247
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,895
If Trump being in office

1248
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
Still facilitated the rise of the Dead

1249
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,783
The goal is averting the mark of the beast

1250
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,879
Ushered everyone into and did not protect you from

1251
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,439
The mark of the beast or whatever

1252
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
He sucks and you shouldn't support him either

1253
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:58,815
That would make sense

1254
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,095
I think

1255
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:04,959
Which I think if I was in government I would officially named something the mark of the beast

1256
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,287
Just cuz I'm so sick of everything being the mark of the beast

1257
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,639
Oh yeah we'll be stacked or something like hey

1258
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
Guess what this is your lucky day Christian

1259
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,599
This is the mark of the beast like a bill to name a library or something

1260
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,415
And then then we wouldn't have to deal with all this while their backs

1261
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,511
Well the barcodes in the back of a while your phone's in mind I'm sick of it

1262
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:33,631
I think he's just sort of like yeah let's do

1263
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,167
Just a call ezcontacts

1264
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
Whatever

1265
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:45,663
To deal with

1266
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
This guy is terrified

1267
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,247
I'll let you know

1268
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Need to call in a

1269
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,807
Jason from Germany

1270
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,855
I had to get my family out of Germany

1271
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
Trump Israel

1272
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,231
5 years

1273
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Yes sir

1274
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,375
Offend

1275
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
Asian

1276
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Brought my family here

1277
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
State of Oregon

1278
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,567
I loved and wanted to put down roots in

1279
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,103
You know it didn't work

1280
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,175
Appears to be

1281
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,455
Become

1282
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,295
Chinese interests more than anything else

1283
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,575
Wow dude you are

1284
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
F****** up your whole life

1285
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:33,279
This guy had to flee Germany because apparently the Muslims

1286
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,631
To the West Coast only defined under Chinese control

1287
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,703
I can't catch a break this is our modern-day odys

1288
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,007
That is what we're dealing with

1289
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,127
Only to find that his wife has left him

1290
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:52,991
I wish I honestly also kept thinking while I was listening to this and I don't know

1291
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
Maybe it's just the mood I'm in

1292
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,551
Keep thinking

1293
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Co-op

1294
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,647
Yeah buddy

1295
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
Grow the f******

1296
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Well

1297
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,583
It's it's just too much LARPing

1298
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,863
It's all larva

1299
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,167
It's so it's so like

1300
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
I get it

1301
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
Real life

1302
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
Are often boring

1303
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,543
It's repetitive

1304
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,335
Not much is going on

1305
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
Especially now

1306
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,663
But you can't live like you're in a fuk

1307
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,687
Talking spy movie

1308
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,759
And the Muslims are invading Germany

1309
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
Come on man

1310
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:31,135
Think a certain amount of it is probably motivated by people recognized

1311
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Difficult

1312
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,719
The time in history this is

1313
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,303
How relatively easy some people have it

1314
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,583
And Eden

1315
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
Tunak

1316
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,631
Feel the guilt

1317
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
Of that

1318
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,495
You take that you said have transformed it into

1319
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,823
Well obviously the Chinese run the West Coast

1320
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:54,175
And I better run away from the Chinese occupied territory

1321
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,223
Right cuz that's the way it that's the way you can

1322
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,247
Can experience only

1323
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,271
We actually paying the

1324
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,063
It's so many other people are living at

1325
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
Without having to

1326
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,367
Actually face it

1327
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,671
Or if wheel like you're sharing

1328
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,975
Pain with people who you actively

1329
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Are told to hate

1330
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,303
Recognize that you are a

1331
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,327
Apart of

1332
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,863
The system that

1333
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
Maintains that status

1334
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,055
So Alex takes another call in

1335
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:25,407
This guy is like really really layered it out there with Infowars all about

1336
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,199
Peninsula lost object

1337
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,735
You would be one of the

1338
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
Preachers if you could just

1339
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,367
Maybe like I don't know what day you do a time but maybe once

Jesus

1344
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
It was first

1345
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,959
But I did realize that

1346
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,775
You know for we wrestle not

01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
Flesh and blood

1348

Against

1349
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
Powers

You know

01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:03,551
Yeah this is the second call Within These two days I didn't even cut the first one cuz it was just going to like

1353
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,855
That's just another person saying that I was brought into

1354
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391

01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,719
Today's calling in being like

Religion to me

1359
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,095
And that's what I mean

1360
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,119
Looking people want

1361
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:21,471
How to be religious like I like I always try and I'm not against religion

1362
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,287
I find this to be a fraud

1363
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,335
I find this to be a con

1364
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
That Alex is doing

1365
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
Where it

1366
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
It's Disick

1367
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
Extremist

1368
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,247
Conversion of Christianity

1369
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,527
Maybe in quotes

1370
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,343
That you can arrive to buy way of

1371
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
Extreme right-wing politics

1372
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Do you know what

1373
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,463
It's not even really religion

1374
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,743
Apollotek

1375
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
Yep but it has Weaver

1376
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
And the Zeal

1377
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,631
Of of religiosity

1378
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
All of your political enemies are demon

1379
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
Yeah you can see it

1380
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,239
Could you have discernment now

1381
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,263
Alright it's it's

1382
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,079
To staged

1383
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,919
Charade religion is the escalation of political

1384
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,735
Violence in the in that sense of like

1385
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,271
Oh my Purp

1386
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,831
So much bigger you know I used to be

1387
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
Politically active where I wanted to

1388
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,391
Affect the

1389
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:14,207
The country in the government and the way my city was run

1390
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,255
But now I'm not just affecting

1391
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
That I mean

1392
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,631
Checking the world and I'm not just affecting the world I'm in virtual world

1393
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:26,495
That is a path that can go that is not what religion

1394
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,127
It's the pits

1395
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,663
The path that Alex

1396
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
Thrives on

1397
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,991
Really it's really a bummer

1398
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,551
Yeah

1399
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
Disney's people

1400
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
Just like living in a

1401
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,647
Completely different world than everyone else

1402
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,743
This guy had to flee Germany because the Muslims invaded

1403
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
And the Chinese are running the West

1404
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:54,399
No Prosperity Gospel preachers should be immediately arrested and imprisoned for life

1405
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,191
Every part of that

1406
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,495
Listen to this Alex is like

1407
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,287
This is the kind of reality that Alex

1408
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,615
Wants to live in and wants to perpetuate for his audience

1409
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,711
I told you 16 years ago that a friend of mine is a big movie producer

1410
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
Was talking to James Cameron

1411
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,231
Decision was made the future there won't even be movies anymore

1412
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,047
New Zealand for the end of the world

1413
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,191
Write it off as an ocean Oceanic

1414
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,471
Researcher but really

1415
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
I've got a fleet of ships

1416
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,615
Very many population operation

1417
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
1560 years ago

1418
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
Now he admits basically all day

1419
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,831
What does basically mean in Mexican

1420
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,927
So if I understand this correctly

1421
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
Movie producer

1422
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,023
Talking James Cameron James Cameron

1423
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
Hey remember Titanic

1424
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
And he was like yes I do

1425
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
We're going to watch it in the Holograms

1426
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,935
And he was like that sounds cool I'm a like

1427
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Psych

1428
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,263
The movies aren't even going to exist

1429
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
So the movie producer

1430
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:09,663
Realizing that he doesn't have a job later on in life was like oh obviously what I'll do

1431
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:15,039
Is scam New Zealand tax system peeps

1432
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:21,695
Telling people you're going to put out those avatars people even though there will be no movie

1433
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,023
Call me what elements of that has been

1434
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,559
Basically admitted to

1435
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
I don't know

1436
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Spy Who

1437
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,567
James Cameron is incredibly committed to

1438
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,615
Do the bed cuz he put out that too

1439
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:46,015

1440
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599

This is the Detachment from reality and it like this stupid s***

1442

Alex

1443
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,511
But that

1444
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,839
It's mixed up with this religious verb

1445
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,119
It gets people

1446
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,655
To think

1447
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:06,239
He's bringing them to some kind of a real spirituality but it's not

1448
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,543
Go to bed. Video CD

800 year old

1451
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,943
Carving of the devil eating a child

Your body

1460
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,007
In a giant genetic ritual

1461
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:39,775

Taking over

Every cell in your body

1467
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Cell by cell

1468
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
A couple segments

Go back to your call

01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:15,871
Alex

1477
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,639
I just want to thank you

1478
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,919
Bringing me to Christ

1479
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:21,759
After you told me there was an 800 year old statue

1480
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:26,623
About the devil eating a child huh and then I looked at what was happening

1481
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,671
At the Space Needle at the Space Needle

1482
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,207
And at the Olympics

1483
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,511
And why not Denver's airport

1484
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
Torture

1485
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Blucifer

1486
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,327
I came to

1487
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
Christ

1488
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,911
And by that I mean I bought wintersun

1489
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
Because they are on sale

1490
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,215
Yeah that was what I meant

1491
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,495
The religion of Alex's

1492
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
Is dumb pills

1493
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Highway Rogers

1494
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
Is on

1495
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:51,967
Oh yeah Cameron's movie after the Avatar sequel where North Korea.

1496
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:55,039
Dramatic

1497
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:59,391
Flyover the main drop the balance off

1498
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,695
Wish I was sorry Tom Hanks

1499
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,535
Alex first of all happy New Year

1500
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:10,143
Be a better year than 2020 although 2020 certainly had its highlights it was

1501
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,447
Not only the year in which I was

1502
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:19,103
Did framed really in a soviet-style show trial also the year in which through the mercy of God

1503
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,175
The president gave me first a commutation that a

1504
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
Oh and unconditional

1505
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,039
Here here is really what I take offense

1506
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,343
Rodger should be furious

1507
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,623
At Trump pardon

1508
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,647
No no

1509
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
Because

1510
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,231
Because now he doesn't have to spend all that money

1511
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:41,631
Proving that he was innocent of being toxic though

1512
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,447
It's good thing that he doesn't have to

1513
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,031
He's going to give back all the money that people donated

1514
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,823
Based on the

1515
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591
Premise

1516
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,615
From around

1517
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,431
The time of that conversation about a commutation

1518
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,223
Rodger was explicitly

1519
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
He didn't want a pardon

1520
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,831
Because he had so much evidence that he could prove that you would set up

1521
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,647
He was going to be the one who's going to be the champion fighting to

1522
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Expose the Deep

1523
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,439
Deep State corruption

1524
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:10,559
That only he could because he had the standing busy at all the evidence that he was innocent who's Olga

1525
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,839
Going to come out in court

1526
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,863
Don't pardon me

1527
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,887
I'm just

1528
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
Afraid to go to prison

1529
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
Because there's a lot of covid

1530
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,263
19 of those prisons and I'm an old man I've been existing

1531
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:22,591
Conditions need to commute my sentence I can survive

1532
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,127
To appeal course

1533
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:27,455
But now of course I can

1534
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,479
F*** you man

1535
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:31,295
The whole story is is gone now

1536
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
I think

1537
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,463
If I were the judge over the judge that gave Rodger Stone so many

1538
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Ifucking Chan

1539
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,303
And then I heard that

1540
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
I would

1541
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:47,423
Think that every decision that I had ever made up to that point was a bad one now listen to me

1542
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,959
If I were somebody who listen

1543
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
The Infowars

1544
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,751
Believe this s***

1545
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,543
I would be mad about this

1546
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,591
I will be mad I be like a Rodger

1547
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
Number one

1548
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,895
You were going to be the one

1549
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,663
Who was Gunn

1550
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,431
How to get

1551
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
Peter strzok

1552
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,015
Thrown in prison or whatever nobody wants

1553
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,295
To be the first

1554
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:08,159
I'm not an info Warrior I was at I'm not the tip of the spear Dan

1555
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,183
I think you said

1556
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:12,255
Okay so I said I would but I don't want to

1557
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:17,631
Begging for money from everybody for his legal defense so he could be there in

1558
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,447
Expose the Deep state if I believe that

1559
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:24,799
Deep state was something real that was an imminent threat and was going to kill my family

1560
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,079
I'd probably be pretty

1561
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,151
Pissed off that Rodger accepted apart in

1562
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
Or even like

1563
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,759
Some kind of a mechanic for rejecting a pardon

1564
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,063
Like if you speak it right now

1565
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,879
I believe there is I believe you can reject

1566
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
He wouldn't need to cuz he could

1567
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
Just tell Trump

1568
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
Don't pardon me

1569
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,279
You could actually do that instead of that publicly

1570
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,583
I will be so mad at him

1571
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,399
I can't believe these people let these people get away with

1572
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
I can

1573
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:54,751
Well yeah I guess I can't do but it's still in. You can get away with this

1574
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
Is

1575
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,615
Herself and that you that it seems almost not

1576
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
It's almost

1577
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Expect

1578
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,687
Mitchell get away with it

1579
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
Swear to God if they were

1580
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,271
They should be smirking

1581
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,087
All the time it has snowed in the area Harrison Ford

1582
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,391
Should play the parts of everyone and Infowars

1583
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:15,999
Would that dumb smirk on his face every time he says anything because if you listen to this your f******

1584
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,535
Harrison Ford

1585
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,327
Harrison Smith

1586
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,375
Turn off my plane

1587
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
So Alex is going to be see this rally

1588
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,591
Just a separate reality that's being discussed

1589
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,639
We're going to d.c.

1590
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,687
Vicodin Romania or

1591
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,735
Nin

1592
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,783
Any other places

1593
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:42,111
And showing our number to the dictatorship

1594
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
Of the lab

1595
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,951
Trying to steal the election

1596
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,999
President

1597
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
We do not want

1598
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,095
Because we have the election our sides

1599
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,143
We have the truth it's the left has finally

1600
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,495
The conception of what's going on

1601
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,519
Completely warped

1602
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
Yeah there's just

1603
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,847
There's I don't even know how to have a conversation

1604
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
And with that

1605
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,151
This is another one of those things

1606
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Kingswear

1607
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Where you like

1608
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
I just

1609
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,015
I just can't believe that this is still

1610
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,855
It's like it's like those conversations it's like those debates

1611
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,159
That you that we've talked about where it's like

1612
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:19,999
You're just having the same conversation they had two thousand years ago break

1613
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
Yeah you don't realize

1614
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
These thoughts

1615
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,095
The people had this conversation

1616
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
While back

1617
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,167
Had afterwards

1618
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
Scholarly

1619
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,007
Discussion about the same way this like

1620
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,847
We've literally seen not just

1621
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,895
This exact thing happened before

1622
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,175
But this exactly happen

1623
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
A couple weeks ago

1624
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:45,855
It's not like this is in the long distant past where there's no way we could possibly learn from our history

1625
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,391
This is a couple weeks

1626
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
And it's only worse

1627
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,535
I just don't

1628
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
I I can't

1629
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
I can't even

1630
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
Fathom

1631
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,679
And this song

1632
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:04,799
It's violent propaganda that's infinite years old always the same s***

1633
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
People still

1634
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,103
Well I mean look

1635
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,895
The truth is

1636
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,687
That Alex is going to do this route

1637
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,991
People have told him

1638
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,271
That if he doesn't

1639
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,319
Then maybe he could back on Facebook

1640
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,647
ABC national news

1641
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,695
I've had others from Fox call me

1642
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,535
I've had Democrat Party lawyers call me whenever you like you

1643
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,095
Theraplatform

1644
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,935
Please don't do this to me see you're going to be in danger somebody might shoot you

1645
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:34,495
Oh please don't leave a violent revolution

1646
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,055
And really what they're doing is calling up and threatening me

1647
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,127
So they're really concerned about the six Rodger

1648
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,687
Got it the bag so much why are they doing this

1649
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
I didn't

1650
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:48,319
So an ABC News host called Alex Jones

1651
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
Don't do this

1652
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
We don't want

1653
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Violence

1654
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:02,911
Into you

1655
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:08,287
We're just how I've always introduce myself on any phone conversation and I just want to let you know we love you

1656
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,591
I like I should tell you I'm a high-ranking globalist

1657
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:15,711
I will get you back on Twitter

1658
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:22,111
This rally we've only seen two of these in the past few weeks and nothing happened then either while something's happen

1659
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,463
Not maybe not to the ovary O'Reilly hours

1660
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
Conform

1661
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,047
And also let's not get it twisted Alex's going

1662
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
Going to show up

1663
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:34,399
Somewhere it's a revolution

1664
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
No no

1665
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
What are the bad

1666
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:49,503
Yeah we got two of the real bad boys here Rodger Stone

1667
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,063
Phuc yea to the real bad boys

1668
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,159
Bad Boys

1669
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,487
Okay

1670
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
Alright

1671
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,327
Alright if we

1672
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
Who's Will Smith

1673
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,887
Send who's Martin Lawrence

1674
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,679
I'm not sure but look

1675
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:12,031
I will say Rodger lives up to his reputation as a bad bad boy

1676
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,848
You know Alex I'm putting in

1677
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,432
Sometimes 17 18 hour days and trying to

1678
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
Finish my book

1679
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,480
Which is

1680
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,528
Rodger Stone did nothing wrong

1681
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
My political

1682
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,368
Persecution and the heist of the 2020 election

1683
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:29,952
Real quick

1684
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:34,048
That's an unwieldy title I would shorten that I like to go back to

1685
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,584
The seventeenth-century title

1686
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:40,448
On the existence of this and over that and on the course

1687
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:42,496
Things that might be in over

1688
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Unwieldy

1689
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:48,896
Love it

1690
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,480
If I was not using brain Force Plus

1691
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
There's no way

1692
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,552
This is a great product

1693
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
Nothing

1694
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,440
Bad Boys how much is it getting paid

1695
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
To say that

1696
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:08,608
I might have suspected that he wasn't getting paid until he said I do not care

1697
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
Hey

1698
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,728
Dicey

1699
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:18,336
Yeah that's what the bad boys do they work 17-hour days

1700
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,896
Self-serving Facebook

1701
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:26,272
And then she'll for Alex's product couple the bad boys, the real Rebels out there

1702
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,808
It looks like bad boys

1703
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
Rodger

1704
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,440
Defining characteristics

1705
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,976
Of bad boys

1706
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
Is

1707
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,048
That they defer to Authority

1708
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
That

1709
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,096
Exactly what they say

1710
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,888
Any situation

1711
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,496
I'm not second-guessing the president knighted states I don't know what he has up his sleeve

1712
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,776
I do know this

1713
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,056
Whatever it is

1714
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
I will support him

1715
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,872
1000%

1716
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,688
Is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln

1717
01:21:54,944 --> 01:22:01,088
Hey you're talking to a guy who hates Abraham Lincoln right now

1718
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:07,488
Yeah so. I mean Lincoln might not be the best example

1719
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,144
To use here saying people that might be a good example

1720
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,680
It looked upon positively

1721
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,216
No but

1722
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,008
Alex and like

1723
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:25,408
You can tell the people who stopped his Confederate royalties

1724
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
Also

1725
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
You're such a bad boy

1726
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:34,368
Whatever Trump does I am I will never never be insubordinate even if he does the things

1727
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
But I say he shouldn't do

1728
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Cuz

1729
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,488
He got me out of that

1730
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
F****** a******

1731
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,656
Jesus we go f*** yourself Rodger

1732
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,960
Valerie like really hard

1733
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,264
Not really hard.

1734
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
To come in

1735
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
Gets better no

1736
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,712
No now doesn't know although this will end quite well

1737
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:04,576
But before that we got to get through the mire that is Robert Barnes

1738
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,136
As a

1739
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:07,904
Plan

1740
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
He's a constitutional lawyer

1741
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,000
So he can explain don't know if any of that

1742
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,816
True but I haven't seen any evidence

1743
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,864
Suggesting the Constitutional lawyer but you can

1744
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,168
He was Wesley Snipes as lawyer

1745
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
Because he knows accounts

1746
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,288
Student is going to lay out for Alex the steps

1747
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
That could happen

1748
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,128
In order for Trump to get into office

1749
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408
Basically

1750
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,200
It's just an elaborately ABS

1751
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:34,272
Certainly complicated plan

1752
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,296
Not going to happen

1753
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,600
Jodi all of those are playbase

1754
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,624
We can play in the

1755
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,928
Question is what do house members and senators

1756
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,512
When presented with argument and evidence about these individuals

1757
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,816
Do they uphold

1758
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
Constitutional election

1759
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
Or do they contain

1760
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,400
Do small election

1761
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
More than

1762
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,752
Vitamins up with fewer than 206

1763
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,776
1670

1764
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,312
Electoral votes at the end

1765
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
Process

1766
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,128
Under the 12th Amendment

1767
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,688
The election goes to the House of Representatives to vote

1768
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,016
Not by individual members but B

1769
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:06,784
State delegation

1770
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
Tablet

1771
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,952
Question was what is Senator join

1772
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
That means he's vote

1773
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
Take place

1774
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,864
These hearings have to

1775
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
To take place

1776
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,400
And that gives

1777
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,936
Is the president while Longshot

1778
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,704
A shot

1779
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,984
Do you have a car

1780
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,008
Tatoosh only correct

1781
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
What can we the people do

1782
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,176
To put pressure

1783
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,712
Obviously March what else

1784
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,552
Chew your food

1785
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,368
Heat during the breaks

1786
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,464
She's a constitutional lawyer tried to tell you how the Constitution works at Rumpke

1787
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,744
Steal this election

1788
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,304
Eat a sandwich while he's there telling me this

1789
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,584
This is

1790
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,608
Is all just this

1791
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,144
Elaborate

1792
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
This route

1793
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,472
So you got the objection

1794
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:01,056
Right let's say Arizona is being

1795
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:01,824
Did too and then

1796
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,616
Somehow magically that objection

1797
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:08,480
Electoral vote

1798
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,552
Biden under the threshold the right now the house elect

1799
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Right oh God it's

1800
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
It's

1801
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,904
It sounds like qanon stuff

1802
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,952
But you should know

1803
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
But even though Alec

1804
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,280
Has not gotten the memo about Lynnwood

1805
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
Robert Barnes has

1806
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,608
I need is not like what he's hearing

1807
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,680
I think Linwood is doing a lot of damage to the

1808
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:28,960
Chase

1809
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,032
In Congress it will where he needs to be

1810
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
House members and senators

1811
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,640
I think the reason why the media is

1812
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,456
Happy to let him go wild and why Twitter has

1813
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,040
Is because they see them as

1814
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Helping Democrat

1815
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,904
But in fact he's not

1816
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,696
She's pursuing alligator

1817
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,792
Cannot be proven at this stage or within this timeframe

1818
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,072
Or allegations

1819
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,632
Distract from the core issues that can be proved

1820
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,448
So entertaining

1821
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,240
Involved with a lot of the qanon types

1822
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,520
Who believe a lot of stuff

1823
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Just has not been proven

1824
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
And that

1825
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,896
That's a key problem and then unfortunately Sidney Powell got

1826
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,176
Entrapped by a lot of that

1827
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,968
Trapped by a lot of that

1828
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:12,992
What does that mean

1829
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,552
Contacts that word counselor

1830
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
I would say

1831
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,672
That my new exhortation

1832
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:25,536
For everyone is to always be carrying tomatoes with you

1833
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,072
Case you see Robert

1834
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,424
I'm Amazed by the turn of phrase that Sidney Powell was in

1835
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,472
Trapped by qanon

1836
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
Qanon

1837
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:41,408
Is that a legally beating filter I don't know is that is that she get to catch a predator and with

1838
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,736
I don't want to say that you believe dumb s***

1839
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,760
Why don't you have a seat

1840
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,088
Glaze out the scenario again

1841
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,368
Yeah for Alex

1842
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,904
Yes so if I understand correctly

1843
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
Play yeah

1844
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,744
It's possible that a Rube Goldberg machine

1845
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
Might have been Act

1846
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:03,168
Debated the idea lawsuit that will then suddenly roll down a at you one of those

1847
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:09,568
Ducks that bends over and drinks water and Pops back up and then they'll be an overthrow of the government and

1848
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,640
World is going to be there playing Constitution mousetrap

1849
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
Gotcha

1850
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,016
How that would how that would happen if

1851
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,112
What two states

1852
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,512
Not reach 270 electoral votes

1853
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,792
Better uncontested

1854
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,328
And does it have not yet

1855
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,096
Certified

1856
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,400
Then the remedy under the 12th and Men

1857
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
Is

1858
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
Go to the house

1859
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,008
There is a

1860
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
12th Amendment

1861
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,592
Vice president

1862
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
He can say

1863
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,664
There's a contest

1864
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,944
Involving too many states

1865
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,736
So there's not enough

1866
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,040
Candidate has more than 270 electoral votes

1867
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,088
Do Under the 12th Amendment

1868
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
Must vote now by

1869
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
Delegation

1870
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
And somehow

1871
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,720
You have a ties

1872
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
Probably wouldn't

1873
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,328
The newly seeded house

1874
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,608
Not the old house but

1875
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,632
The newly seeded house

1876
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
How's that would vote

1877
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,936
Bi-State

1878
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,704
And whoever gets

1879
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,984
26 States

1880
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,008
To vote for them

1881
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Went

1882
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,544
I ordered

1883
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,616
What's 25 + 23 + 2 or type

1884
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
They went

1885
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,944
The president has an Edgewood

1886
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,712
27

1887
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:24,832
The Georgia election also more important

1888
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
Yes that's why they

1889
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,648
That's why he

1890
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,672
Pursuing it

1891
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
He knows he needs

1892
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,744
Those Republican Senators

1893
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
To have a chance

1894
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,304
To the house delegation

1895
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:38,400
First place to get to the stupid Hail Mary nonsense who you're talking about

1896
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,192
Oh this is why I like

1897
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
That election is

1898
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:41,984
Is important

1899
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
To drop

1900
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,544
Oh yeah that makes sense

1901
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,080
This is not

1902
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
Here's a here's why this stuff

1903
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:49,664
Exist

1904
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
Hey it's because

1905
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,712
Does this make sense

1906
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:58,368
When it's only white landowners who are allowed to vote so you can have all these conversations in Congress cuz you like

1907
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:01,440
This is also the total number of people who are allowed to vote

1908
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
Miss election

1909
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,512
But wouldn't it but when everybody's allowed to vote

1910
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
Okay

1911
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,352
It sooner or later

1912
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,376
This is going to have to happen

1913
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,424
One side

1914
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,960
Is going to have to accept

1915
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,520
What they believe is in an undemocratic election

1916
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:18,592
I wouldn't either way but we already did 2000

1917
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,616
Exactly

1918
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,920
So that's how it's going to go.

1919
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:24,736
Neither was either the Democrats admit

1920
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:31,136
Fine you can stay in office because you imagine something happened and we're just going to live with it or Republican

1921
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,416
They're going to have to be like

1922
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,768
Fine we're just fine with a nun democratically chosen president because

1923
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:39,072
Quittin time are these people going to ever believe

1924
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,144
That they that he's the

1925
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,008
Except what they perceived actually undemocratic

1926
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:50,592
Exactly. In their minds it's just as real as anything

1927
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
So that mean

1928
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,992
Humble Pie that will need to be eaten

1929
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,272
Bye

1930
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,552
Trump fans

1931
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,832
Because otherwise

1932
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
Or

1933
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,392
Vallarta

1934
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,672
Blown up knees

1935
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,488
Like that old that'll be one way for us to eat Humble Pie

1936
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,280
Here's the thing

1937
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
Barnes has got this

1938
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:14,912
Elaborate scenario wherein baby

1939
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,216
Amendment where parents can just be like

1940
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,520
Hey she doesn't look good let's

1941
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,616
Steal Bob's interpretation of the 12th

1942
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,896
What's the amendment

1943
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,200
Is a little bit worried about that though

1944
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,480
Because why

1945
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,808
Kind of dictator ish

1946
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,344
Alex Wood

1947
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,624
The perception of being a dick.

1948
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,208
Is there another way so they don't point

1949
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,488
Overturn the election

1950
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
People out there

1951
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,352
To say we're going to have a

1952
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:47,424
Watchers a big question

1953
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,728
You should redo that's the international standard

1954
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
Have to do that

1955
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,408
Congress could do that

1956
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,944
Congress could send another election day

1957
01:30:59,456 --> 01:30:59,968
And say that

1958
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,760
In the contested presidential election

1959
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,576
We're going to have election day on January 19th

1960
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,344
Example

1961
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,392
Cowardly

1962
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,304
People in Congress

1963
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:21,728
The way in Geneva

1964
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,312
He was always open to that but he

1965
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
Is original

1966
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,384
Preferred that he be declared

1967
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,408
The winner based on

1968
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,176
Hedonist

1969
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,712
Yeah that makes sense

1970
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,992
Wild

1971
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,016
Wild

1972
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,320
It's like looking into a

1973
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,856
Funhouse mirror

1974
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:44,256
Nuts I would give anything for a Democratic party as strong and as conniving as what they

1975
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
I would take

1976
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,840
Single activist

1977
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:52,960
Under the age of 20 over anybody in congress right now

1978
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,752
That's the reality of it

1979
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,288
They're pathetic

1980
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,568
It's sad

1981
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,592
It's

1982
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:01,920
It's sad even so like

1983
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,504
I mean like we can talk about that all day

1984
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,528
I'm I'm

1985
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,112
I'm much more interested in how this is being painted

1986
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,416
Yeah they're talking about like

1987
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:16,512
Do you know like the sensible Middle Ground is another election

1988
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
Play JLo

1989
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,072
We can just do another Alexa

1990
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:22,144
As a favor to the Democrats we could do another election

1991
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,424
What the

1992
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,960
F*** how many how much

1993
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,752
Attached is this

1994
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,520
I don't know

1995
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,080
I don't know I don't know how you could even take it

1996
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,104
Seriously as a

1997
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,896
Okay you want another election

1998
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,712
What will need to happen for you to agree

1999
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,480
That Biden

2000
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:43,136
Just tell me just why are the parameters for another election if you had to write down

2001
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,672
Exactly what you need

2002
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,952
To accept the election

2003
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,536
And then if it happens you have to shut the fuk up forever

2004
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:54,656
Sorry I can't do that

2005
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:58,496
Also on Stefan molyneux show with

2006
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:02,336
Year

2007
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:05,408
The problem for Trump is that he has a lack of that lies

2008
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,200
And that they've all betrayed

2009
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,248
I wonder why they would do that

2010
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,040
The fundamental weakness

2011
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:11,808
The present is hat

2012
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,832
Throughout his four-year

2013
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Your tenure

2014
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,160
Has been the lack of allies and key position

2015
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
Random

2016
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
And he's coming

2017
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,000
To terms with the full Rec

2018
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,536
Recognition of what that means

2019
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,072
CiCi's McConnell

2020
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
Recommended

2021
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,632
I just betray him at every single

2022
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,680
Mikado tricep

2023
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,216
Betray him in the Senate on the

2024
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Upcoming

2025
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,520
As he sees

2026
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
What's happened with

2027
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,848
The Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia

2028
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
Undermining

2029
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,664
So he now fully appreciate

2030
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,456
Hate it but I think he undervalued it

2031
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,224
Before

2032
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,272
Any heads too few allies in the effect

2033
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
But it's my eyes would have him

2034
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,600
Periscoping every single day

2035
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,904
Would have him doing you introducing

2036
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,928
Trump TV now

2037
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,976
And doing at least one hour update

2038
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,000
It's every single night

2039
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:52,768
Answering

2040
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,840
Getting people proactive

2041
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,912
Add he contracted

2042
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:03,264
And some of this linsanity from Linwood and some of the other Q movements

2043
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,544
Could not have

2044
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
Diverted

2045
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,920
Detentions

2046
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:16,576
I don't know if it's a good idea or not but I will tell you I don't want to live in a world where the president is mood lighting

2047
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:24,256
In the reality we live in I think it might be a smart idea I don't want to live there

2048
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,096
We're talkin about you different things you're talking about effect

2049
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,888
I'm talking about

2050
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,424
That would be dark

2051
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,752
I'm more mad at him taking linsanity away

2052
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,056
Daddy's girl

2053
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,128
Good things that have happened to the Knicks in the past

2054
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:40,896
Hundred-year

2055
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,968
Shame on you Barnes

2056
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,992
5 Goodman

2057
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,016
It's okay

2058
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
I guess

2059
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:52,160
They want Trump to have a media outlet that he's operating while he is

2060
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,184
Power and

2061
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,000
It should have been doing it while he was

2062
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,536
Trying to be real

2063
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
F***** up

2064
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,376
You know it's not dystopian at all

2065
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,144
Is if it was

2066
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:08,544
Forced into our homes no matter what we did and it was always on time and you couldn't even turn the TV off if you wanted to

2067
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:14,944
Buddy's suggested that on the other day. That reminds me of this

2068
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,760
That they like to talk about all that all the time what was

2069
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:21,600
Is it called

2070
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,880
The the

2071
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,160
Dictators

2072
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,208
Dystopia he was always on that they're going to Willows

2073
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:29,280
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride

2074
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,816
So

2075
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:34,656
You may recall the last time Alex went to DC spoke that Jericho

2076
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,936
And

2077
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,472
And of course the day you ran into Mike

2078
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
Flint

2079
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,128
Unfortunately video came out of this where Michael and looked at Alex like he was a weirdo

2080
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,920
And then ran away

2081
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,456
We have an update on that

2082
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,248
Turn that my client called to apologize

2083
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,088
I told the story of how this happened

2084
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,880
Immediately

2085
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:58,464
Because no one else was stepping up and the Magical cue group

2086
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,024
Magical Intel Griptilian

2087
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,936
I'm sorry about how it look like my next boyfriend

2088
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,264
He's going to be there

2089
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,800
Everybody together

2090
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,824
Everybody's good

2091
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:16,128
Everything's great

2092
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,992
I was startled by you what I look like I was in the fridge

2093
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,808
Normally normally I don't particularly care

2094
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,112
Anytime they do there's like when reach

2095
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:26,880
4 comments

2096
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:27,904
This person said

2097
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,976
The only time I want Michael Flynn on record as having

2098
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:37,376
Lakeside yes or no

2099
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:45,056
Are we going to draw the line on it

2100
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,848
I don't know Jesus

2101
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,432
Anyway I'd like to remind you before I play this clip that Robert Barnes at

2102
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,224
The Constitutional lawyer are you sure

2103
01:36:56,576 --> 01:37:02,464
And just be the president in absentia constitutional

2104
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,232
Constitution says

2105
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,792
Oh no doubt about it to be at the

2106
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:06,816
It has been too much

2107
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
Focus at the top

2108
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
You always spoke

2109
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,448
We need to focus this used to be a bottom-up revolution if it's going to work

2110
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,240
You're complaining that other people are focused

2111
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,056
Isn't too much at the top of a make-believe second

2112
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:17,824
President

2113
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:20,384
That seems like a pretty harsh focus on the top

2114
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:28,576
Are we just going to Exile him to an island for a while until he eventually returns to recapture his no

2115
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,600
Empire

2116
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
I like Island

2117
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,160
That's too much

2118
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,464
Send them to Atlantis all right

2119
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,816
I promised you that we were going to end this episode on

2120
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,352
And we will

2121
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,400
Okay because there is a call

2122
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
That comes in

2123
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,960
That is huge

2124
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,544
Talk to John in Wyoming John thanks for all the glad

2125
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,080
Good morning Ali

2126
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:55,968
He's alive

2127
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:02,368
Sign of Life January 1st 2021 is on the first year of

2128
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:08,768
The first day of the new year he's like I don't know a groundhog showing up in Madison its shadow

2129
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:14,656
Old man house

2130
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:21,056
He probably is going to lose in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming

2131
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:26,688
Although he is really old people never call

2132
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,504
Call is not very

2133
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
Nothing at all but

2134
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,088
It is worth celebrating the kids alive

2135
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,648
Tennessee and back

2136
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,976
And even calling in for like 15 16 Maybe

2137
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,536
How long you been calling and John you haven't gotten on here

2138
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,608
Me and I'll sense Little Orphan Annie

2139
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,168

I'll get you on with Harrison on the American Turtle giving him your name and number

2141
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:03,552
/ 17

2142
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:07,392
I was in college

2143
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:11,232
First day I gave you the phone number

2144
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:17,632
Old man house phone

2145
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:23,264
I don't think I can do FaceTime on my rotary

2146
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:28,640
Hold on I have to plug into the other operator and see if

2147
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,664
She can handle that out

2148
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:35,040
I'm sorry I can't I can't come on you're so today I might has a party line

2149
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:38,112
Could you please hang up I need to keep this line open

2150
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,928
Wow

2151
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
Oh man

2152
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:46,560
Wow wow wow the problem is everybody should have a good house phone just in

2153
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,352
In case they need to hang up on Alex

2154
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:54,496
Sure cuz if you could hang up on you can make a real good noise out of it and be great I do think that people

2155
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,288
Who are of a certain age

2156
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,056
Younger Folk

2157
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,592
Don't know that

2158
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,872
Experience Joy

2159
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,152
A really

2160
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:07,552
Slamming the phone down just like cathartic solving a lot of problems that you didn't even know you had with one

2161
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,320
Phone slam

2162
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,112
Yeah I don't miss it though

2163
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,136
Maybe I was amore

2164
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,672
Angsty person whenever

2165
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:19,072
Stationary phones

2166
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:25,472
The things on the wall phone

2167
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,312
Slam a wall phone horizontally but it doesn't stick

2168
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,872
It's just like it just drops

2169
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,688
Did not work

2170
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
Tripping up

2171
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,992
The stairs Whenever two people

2172
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,832
I can see you and there's no escape from that moment of embarrassment Gary like

2173
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Scalp

2174
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:47,488
So are we begin 2021 and I think that there is a I think

2175
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,304
Old man house phone showing up and giving us proof of life is

2176
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,584
He's probably

2177
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,376
A great sign

2178
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:57,984
Yeah I think it says 2021 is going to be more house phone

2179
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,520
Oriented

2180
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,360
Maybe I don't know I don't know what it pretends

2181
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
But it's something

2182
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,408
Positive

2183
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,200
Step backward in Tech

2184
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,480
Logical development

I forgive you

2188

I just wanted to play that I forgot to play the beginning

2189
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,280
Sorry

2190
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,608
Oh that's sorry as always

2191
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:31,008
To say it is the right thing to say it's just weird I want to know what that's the other thing

2192
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:33,312
2 questions for once

2193
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,336
The plexiglass

2194
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,872
Between Atlanta

2195
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,408
And why do you say sorry

2196
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:42,016
What's the what is motivating that are you at

2197
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,552
Ticketmaster

Please find a local charity or bail Fund in your area to help out

2202
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:03,776

Quintero rundus

2205

I'm thrilled my house phone is alive I mean that on sarcastically it's pretty nice to hear from them again

2206
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:18,880
