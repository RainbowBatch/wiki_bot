00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Nike.com

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,048
Looks around

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Jordan

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
What's up

9
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,984
My bright spot today is I like to thank a walk out there named Pat

10
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Who got in touch

11
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
Episode 1 the first time

12
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,968
Actually paid off and I've got to

13
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Some interesting stuff

14
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,136
Got so I really appreciate that is kind of like

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Spoiler alert

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,048
Basically I'm really underselling the episode were about to do

17
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,936
And I don't enjoy listening to it nearly as much as I I probably would some kind of

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
We ain't even the past

19
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Intellectual EX

20
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
Exercise kind of things

21
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,152
But you're saying we're going to be at 12

22
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,992
Now I would

23
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
Baseball that is all about Auntie communist

24
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
Torero's

25
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,072
B b w Deanna is I found a TV show called what

26
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Burlington paranormal

27
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
Okay that's made by the same guys that did what we do in the shadows Jemaine Clement

28
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Send taika waititi

29
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
Ttn.

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Fantastic is really good

31
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,200
It's like an X-Files that's super understated in that New Zealand way where it's like

32
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
They're trying to give a

33
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
Ticket to a werewolf like that kind of

34
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Situation where they're just

35
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,000
Oblivious to be absolute Insanity going on around them is just like we're just trying to do our job

36
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
I can dig that

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
It's really really funny it's in that great

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Bane of the

39
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Battery kind of stuff

40
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
I hate I hate these kinds of almond

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Because I like

42
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
I hear that if I got sounds good I probably enjoy that it's not exactly

43
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,688
Oh well maybe one day maybe

44
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Get to New Zealand

45
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,272
Watch it

46
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Yeah

47
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Do you know Jordan

48
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
I got to say I don't

49
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
I feel like it's been too long

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
I don't

51
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
This it feels like too long in between episodes

52
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Between Mondays and Fridays

53
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
It really does

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Okay

55
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
It just feels

56
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Like too long

57
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
You are I'm I'm itching to be back in the seat out early incapable of doing anything but 12 episodes per week

58
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
I don't like it

59
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
I feel like we're getting back together

60
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
In Forever

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Surprising

62
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
Especially considering considering I think we watched a movie together on Tuesday

63
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
Whatever anyway

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,768
Homicidal

65
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,888
And this is

66
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
Right hand man

67
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Beginning of this week

68
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Alex was gone

69
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,104
Again again doing something

70
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
On the east

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Coast

72
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Mysterious

73
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
He's trying to get out of Texas

74
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Slowly and then

75
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
Mulligan back in like the

76
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,952
The Twilight Zone got a situation he apparently recorded a video of himself

77
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
The Skull and Bones

78
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,399
I applaud going back to his roots kind of thing you should be moving back towards

79
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
Certainly better than

80
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,311
Literal devil stuff

81
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,407
DL or whatever it is fine at the same time as I expressed to you

82
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
I'm going to be furious if I have to do more episodes about where geronimo's bones are

83
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
That's true don't want to hear it

84
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
Anyway he's back

85
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
On the 23rd

86
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
And

87
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
I would say but not better than ever

88
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
And we'll get down

89
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,143
Talking about

90
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Some folks who are you

Baby goblin what's going on and I'll probably walk

104
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,967
Did you know that baby goblin was made a lord

105
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,855
Between now and when they sent that in total

106
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,951
Alex our Lord did not realize it was this honorific

107
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
And then also that reminded me that when we were doing our zipping up the mailbag

108
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,711
Cameron Cameron

109
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991

110
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
What do

111
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
You are now a technic

112
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
I'm a policy wonk

113
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Business

114
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Money off that heroin

115
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175
Yes thank you very much

116
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Would say that this

117
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Stretch of time is bad

118
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Actually a b v

119
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
That I felt

120
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
It was

121
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Offensively bad

122
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
Felt more like

123
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
I don't want to do this

124
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
Which type we have many different types

125
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,935
Is it bad on time

126
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:10,335
What kind what type of batter we talked about we can't even use the word bad at all that's true

127
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
Gyro exactly pigeonhole it but it just feels like

128
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Generalized insight

129
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,783
And it's kind of a generalized boring incitement that's

130
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
She has to do around

131
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
White Spears

132
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
Immigrants there's a lot of that

133
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Question

134
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
On a certain level while I was listening to these

135
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Is this even worth

136
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,935
It does this rise to the level of paying attention to it

137
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Because it's

138
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Pretty much just

139
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Parking Brooks

140
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Most of the time

141
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
No

142
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
It's not even superb

143
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
It's gross

144
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
Here's a air contact dropper

145
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Today Show

146
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783

147
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
The ugliest that they're not real

148
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
Can you see a mannequin

149
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
You know it's plastic fruit matter how good it is

150
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
How big it is

151
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
You look at it you know that's fake

152
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
You just know

153
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
Normal

154
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
That's not normal

155
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
God bless

156
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Ice cream

157
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,855

160
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
And I was like

161
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,535
All I want to do now for the rest of my life

162
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
Plastic fruit around Alex

163
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
I just want to get him on camera eating plastic

164
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Yeah

165
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,943
It's like somebody goes out of the way at all of a sudden be like you know I've never trip going upstairs and

166
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,015
People do it before but not

167
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
So Alex is late to work

168
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,391
On the 23rd because his plane was delayed

169
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
Answer he recorded himself

170
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Prior to this

171
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
So you have something to play

172
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143

Bulldozers project veritas

Ensued

192
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
The time can move forward

193
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,495
A couple articles in the times are referred to as a Veritas videos as deceptive but the judge felt this way

194
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Who's more opinion

195
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Then it was straight up recording

196
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Live news

197
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,431
This kind of ruling honestly just seems like a parody where a liar is getting the court

198
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Journalist

199
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
Strictly adhere to rules that they themselves think our jokes

200
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,159
How do I get the game here for project Veritas isn't actually to win the case or anything like that

201
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,767
It's about the media circus that can drown up along the way while simultaneously trying to make other outlets

202
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Hypocritically cover their work

203
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
That's what's going on

204
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
Yeah we should there should be there should be a

205
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
Consultancy for dumb old judge

206
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,591
Who are like well I guess we have to take these people as good-faith actors because of the legal system

207
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
And we could just be like

208
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,223
Hey know you guys probably should have charged them with a federal crime

209
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
A few years ago so no

210
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
So Alex still hasn't shown up at this point

211
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
And

212
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
It's getting to be like

213
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
Ways into the show hand-sewing

214
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
I've got a break in

215
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Snooze

216
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
Gentlemen we are live inside the Infowars World Headquarters are Owen Shroyer sitting in studio

217
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
I want to go back to Alex Jones here shortly he's going to be joining us alive here shortly as well

218
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,639
The break-in and

219
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,503
Support some of the latest that we know of the Boulder Colorado shooter

220
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,575
Obviously his name Ahmad

221
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Issa

222
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,671
It's now coming out he was and Islamic

223
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
States

224
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
Besides her show and Islam assist he was a

225
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
Immigrant from Syria

226
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,863
I don't know if I can find any evidence that he was in Islamic

227
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Mcstate sympathizer

228
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,215
Outside of wild conjecture being made by the guy who runs

229
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Jihad watch

230
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
Yeah I was going to say all we've got there is

231
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
Is Owen read the name and he was like well obviously this

232
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
This is a terrorist that I find really interesting is even like within the last week you can see how

233
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
News is dealt with differently

234
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
When there was the those shootings at the spas in Atlanta Alex didn't even talk about it no MMA next day was like

235
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
Weird out or whatever

236
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Batman just moved on

237
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Maybe touch

238
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
The story for a second

239
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
On the second day

240
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
When is this

241
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Break into coverage

242
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,263
Yeah

243
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,615
Trying to see what's going on

244
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
Phil people with

245
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
Great shame

246
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
And the only way they can survive this long

247
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Having that part of their brain removed

248
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Did Tom Boyden

249
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Because Daddy

250
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Just on a

251
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Really deep

252
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Human level

253
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Just discussed

254
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Because if

255
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Cruise

256
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
Beyond Reasonable Doubt

257
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
That they are choosing which

258
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Stories

259
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Malicious

260
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Not

261
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,007
Because of any kind of newsworthiness

262
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Purely by me

263
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Yeah

264
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,527
Straight throughout the Moses career

265
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
That's pretty tough

266
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:18,207
Sewing

267
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
These cases

268
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
I'm shooting

269
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,887
Of course but also psych meds got to talk about that got a

270
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Portray him as

271
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,983
The other side bro

272
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
He was it seems maybe a paranoid schizo

273
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
The phrenic

274
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,735
So who knows what kind of pharmaceutical drugs he had been prescribed potentially

275
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
4

276
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
For those mental

277
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Problems

278
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:49,439
And then we also have a lot of his social media activity before it was

279
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Deleted

280
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Before it was deleted

281
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
Showing that he was an anti

282
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
A he was a

283
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Leftist

284
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Liberal

285
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Progressive

286
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
He was a

287
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
One of those

288
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
The leftist narrative

289
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
To a T

290
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,455
They do have some screenshots of what appear to be his social media and I don't

291
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Slightly Fair

292
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
That post that they

293
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Show that were critical of

294
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Trump but like

295
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
Like cool I don't know how much

296
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
It doesn't seem like it has anything to do with

297
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
At least I would demonstrate it at all it is anything to do with what happened

298
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Please audio

299
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
The shooting

300
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,055
Incredibly exploitative but I'm not going to play I know he has afterwards

301
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
This is his

302
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
A pre-recorded also

303
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
Is the name

304
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Was Eric Chou

305
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
1 year old father

306
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
7

307
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Who was the patriot

308
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,767
Amazing

309
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
He died heroically

310
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Helping stop

311
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
Boulder Colorado

312
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
This is tragic

313
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,783
You know not going to diminish anything but that the way Alex is behaving around this

314
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Is really

315
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Exploit

316
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Yeah it's really the only way I can put it

317
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,719
And then when towing starts talkin about what the solution to these problem

318
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Bizarre

319
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
It kind of runs

320
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Counter to

321
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Way Alex

322
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Is pre-recorded stuff is

323
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
To build this up

324
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Here's the deal

325
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,239
Mass shootings in this country are really a rare occurrence

326
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,079
And they would be even more rare if we had citizens with

327
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Gunstop

328
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,015
But they know the police take at least two minutes to get to the scene so they know they can fire off at least

329
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Around

330
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
An innocent people

331
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
Killing people and get away with it

332
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
Because they never get stop

333
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Until the cops show up

334
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
1

335
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,791
Person one citizen

336
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
One good citizen with a gun could have saved lives

337
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
In that Colorado

338
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Grocery store

339
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Until there's a toll notion like

340
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,079
Oh you just want to be like Allah bless everybody with a pistol on their hip

341
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
That's not how I want it

342
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Then I wanted at all

343
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
I want white people to have guns

344
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
1

345
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
Crazy guy one bad guy with a gun to kill

346
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
10 people

347
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
All it would have taken with one good guy with a gun in that store to stop

348
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Problem is that one of the people who is

349
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
Who was responding who had a gun

350
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Oh they weren't they didn't give

351
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
From the gun that day

352
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
I mean it's not it's not like this

353
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,007
Disproves any possibility of someone disrupt

354
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Take an active shooting or anything like

355
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,871
The notion that they have it this is a magic

356
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,479
Bullet 222 stop situation

357
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
It's just Luke

358
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
Yeah in order to stop mass shooting

359
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
We need to get one good guy with a

360
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
The gun to either

361
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
Assume people are going to be a mass shooter and just start killing a before anyone is a mass shooter

362
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,679
Get to the point where they're killing your fight

363
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
Michaela

364
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,199
Into the center of an active shooting

365
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
And deputized yourself to

366
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Do shootout

367
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
Somebody who

368
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
I don't I don't think this is a good

369
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,719
Good solution reporting is is a little bit convoluted on this front

370
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,607
Belief that most people won't ever be released

371
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Anti

372
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
I mean

373
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
There's a little

374
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Little offense

375
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
But

376
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
Will be affected by

377
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
Liberal policies

378
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
Most people listen to this broadcast

379
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
I will probably never be directly impact

380
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Pray to God that continues

381
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
But almost everybody listening to this pot

382
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:04,159
Podcast almost everybody listening to this radio show almost everybody watching this right now

383
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,719
Is going to be negatively impact

384
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
Happy by Democrat liberal policies

385
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
Just like everyone in that grocery store was

386
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Wow

387
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:19,775
And now the liberal-left these are going so out of control their minds are so warped their minds are so

388
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Bent

389
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Propagandized

390
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
They've become

391
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Danger to society

392
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,455
This individual was a danger to society

393
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
He came in with a gun

394
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Ethiopia

395
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,087
Almost these liberals may not have a gun

396
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
But they're dangerous just decide

397
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Their policies will kill you

398
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Their policies will kill

399
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Freedom in the West

400
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
The only policies really that he could be really talking about how every gun control

401
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,359
Ability disarming people who could be the good person with a gun who can carry out murder Sheriff against the murderer

402
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Or it's

403
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Immigration-related

404
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Because this guy came

405
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
From Serie A number of years back

406
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
And so that would be the left

407
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
This policy that he's attacking the Earth

408
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
They're letting people who do these mass shootings

409
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Either way

410
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Dumb

411
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
So

412
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Disappointed

413
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Yeah I mean it's hard

414
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
To just

415
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
It's not far

416
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Apart

417
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
It's hard to be like oh it's

418
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
Liberals letting people in

419
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
A week after 8

420
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
It's not liberals

421
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
You know it's

422
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
It's like

423
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
Maybe there's a larger prop

424
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Maybe there's one that should be dealt with

425
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
Maybe we should deal with it in a way that make

426
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,719
And unfortunately

427
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Do you want to come down

428
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
No-oooooo are you sure

429
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
No I'm alright Fred house

430
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,191
Would you like an appetizer

431
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
Are you doing looking at this through he's very milquetoast

432
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
But also like

433
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Clearly

434
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
Pretty extreme

435
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Yeah.

436
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
You've got a psychopathic energy of

437
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
The banality of

438
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
Evil about him Alex

439
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
Is boar

440
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Laxative

441
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
Interesting and Harrison Smith

442
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Is more of a straight-up bigot

443
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Yeah Harrison Smith just says

444
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,863
Don't let brown people in and if they are in shoot them with guns but

445
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Being boring about

446
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Which is terrified

447
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
Owen is done

448
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
At this point Alex's backup

449
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
You know he was doing

450
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Secret

451
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Well I was on a secret mission in Connecticut that will find out what it is

452
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,599
Austin just landed about 30 minutes ago rushed here to Studio

453
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,415
Flight was delayed or I would have been there to start the broadcast

454
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,511
So we don't know we don't get the we don't get tune-up find out what this Secret

455
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Mission was

456
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
Etiquette

457
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
We don't get to find out what it is

458
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,239
What about the music

459
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
That wasn't it meme

460
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,639
His main trip was I would guess if I had to bet anything of your employer related

461
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Connecticut

462
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,015
Does he have any possible reason there's no secret mission I could think of to go to kinetic

463
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,367
You know if there's a lot of reasons to go to Connecticut if you're Alex Jones

464
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,768
He has more reason to go to Connecticut that just about anybody else alive

465
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
He is one very specific reason

466
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
ETA is locked into kinetic

467
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Discovery or something

468
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
To do with

469
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:39,200
Sandy Hook case I mean like I can't imagine it being unrelated hard

470
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Said he was going to the East Coasters like

471
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
Smells like Sandy Hook something

472
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:47,904
No I don't I don't I don't know this

473
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
Well you either

474
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,536
Good either Sandy Hook case related or went to Stanford and he's trying to get

475
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Get a job Within

476
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm not going to say no to that

477
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,728
It's the only other possibility

478
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,360
Hidan I went there for a semester maybe he's following your footsteps he's always wanted to be me

479
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
So

480
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
You know

481
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
This narrative gets really interesting with Alex

482
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,552
Bad camps for immigrants

483
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Coming over

484
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
Trump cleaned it all up good and good

485
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,952
Good out bad again

486
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
What bad really fast seems like it's too fast

487
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Well it's because

488
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Biden had a clip

489
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
It's playing where you saying

490
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
People to surgeon whenever you

491
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Becomes president sure

492
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
He's talking about his people applying for refugees disallowed from being able to apply for refugee

493
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
That is during the Trump

494
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Administration

495
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Because he would

496
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,296
Refugees during the entire trumpet

497
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
Ministration

498
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Sounds like can we have

499
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
More than four

500
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
That's not accurate but also

501
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
The ceiling was dropped

502
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
Quite a bit and the only way to

503
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,680
Apply for asylum in the United States as a refugee

504
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
You have to be in the United

505
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,312
Administration would stop people from making it

506
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Into

507
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,128
Consulates or On the Border

508
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
Yeah that was what you talkin about

509
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Pretending

510
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
That was like everybody

511
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,832
Anyway it's bad

512
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
The camps are back bad sure and sure

513
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
Water fountains in each area

514
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
AOC went and cried

515
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
She's not crying now

516
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
Because she's a monster

517
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,568
And explore the most powerful rich

518
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Tax-exempt billionaires

519
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Planet

520
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Ladies and gentlemen

521
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,272
AOC literally came out immediately against Biden having migrant facilities open

522
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
For children

523
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,160
She tweeted quote this is not okay never has been okay never will be okay no matter the administration

524
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
Dinner party

525
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
I was just making up that AOC doesn't oppose

526
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
The things the bidens administration is doing at the border because that's

527
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
That's too complicated of a story for him to tell his audience

528
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
The listeners are used to vary some

529
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,216
Simplistic Good vs Evil characterizations of people so

530
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
Introduce the idea that AOC was against

531
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
The treatment of migrants under Trump

532
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Still opposed

533
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Do the same types of treatment under Biden

534
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
Represents a threat to the

535
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
Pictures that Alex's paint

536
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Yeah really

537
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,552
F*** things up whenever your enemy I suppose

538
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Alex

539
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Has ideologic

540
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Consistency

541
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,768
And ideological differences between the people Alex wants are all working for the

542
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,816
The f****** devil

543
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,656
That's what I'm saying plenty of Democrats who are like

544
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,008
Democrats in the white house now it don't need to worry about her

545
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Yeah that's

546
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,616
Veterinary assistant

547
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
So

548
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
I like the most

549
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
This episode has been emigrar

550
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Bashing at this point

551
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
I am not

552
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
You know cut out

553
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Just because

554
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Cuz it's kind of

555
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
Standard boring Emigrant bashing

556
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Just don't I don't know he said

557
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
A lot of this stuff before

558
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
It's non-white people going into

559
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
We got it

560
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
In hard

561
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
People

562
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,800
Most of the Court Middle Eastern immigrants

563
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
It's over 75% better man

564
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
In Europe

565
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
5%

566
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
Military age

567
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
Yeah there's a sweet I'm mad

568
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Isa

569
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
Why refugees and immigrants are

570
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Good

571
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Search

572
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
Connect that to the

573
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,240
The boulder shooting in a can of makes a little clear without Owens line of thought probably was

574
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,592
Episodes almost impossible to listen to there's no real Subs

575
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,432
Going on it's mostly Alex's rambling nonsense to make his listeners afraid of

576
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
According to the

577
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,064
Pew research numbers put out in August 2020 Alex is completely full of s***

578
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,880
One thing he probably doesn't even know is that

579
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,976
Among all refugees admitted in fiscal year 2019

580
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
4900 are Muslim

581
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
N20 3800r Chris

582
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
16% Muslim and 79%

583
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,728
That's super different than the picture Alex tends to paint

584
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Which is a queer

585
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Got a weird

586
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
Also

587
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
The statistics from the Department of Homeland Security regarding Refugee arrivals in

588
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
2019

589
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,992
There's just no way to pretend that everyone coming in our military age men

590
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,832
4149 percent of arrivals in 2019 were women

591
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,672
Secondly 12% of all arrivals were age 45

592
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
Older but then again I have no idea what Alex

593
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Who considered military age

594
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Finally

595
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,680
The thing that Alex is mostly banking on here is it 43.2% of arrivals were between the ages of 0 and 7

596
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,520
That's a pretty wide age Gap so using the same number Alex

597
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
I could try to make you scared of refugee.

598
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
And someone else could explain to you that a lot of these

599
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
People are

600
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,992
Issues related to immigration and Refugee resettlement are super important in the real world

601
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
But they aren't important when dealing with Alec

602
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
He isn't living in reality and making an argument for policy

603
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:11,488
He's decided that he hates immigration and the us becoming less white and he's making up s*** to justify

604
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
None of this stuff is real and it's just

605
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
Manipulative fear

606
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
It's boring

607
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Really really

608
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
F***** up on the back of a racist

609
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Misogynist mass shooting

610
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
Like

611
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Okay

612
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,616
Well we got a hold off on being racist towards Asian for a little bit

613
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
So not be raised

614
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
So we're going to switch Target

615
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
To just

616
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Blanket image

617
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
How many bucking years are we going to do this

618
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
It's not like this is a new thing for some white

619
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
Mother f****** a******

620
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
To start screaming that all immigrants are evil

621
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,352
We do it all the goddamn time you mean Alex not the shooter

622
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,448
No I don't mean I get I mean Alia Bhatt I mean like

623
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
You can read

624
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,824
Newspaper articles from 1790 words like now we got to close our f***

625
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Borders

626
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
You know it's like

627
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,224
Animal groups can change

628
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,552
But the mentality stays the same and

629
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Up in

630
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Violin

631
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
It does

632
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Stop

633
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,952
If we could deal with it but we just refused

634
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,768
Still under some b******* Banner of

635
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,376
Just like project Veritas being allowed to go with their f****** lawsuit

636
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
These guys are not good faith to act

637
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Probably not

638
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
But you know who

639
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,336
You should go to for information

640
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,152
And ideas about immigration

641
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,736
Someone in Europe where the great track record

642
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
Someone who might be the head of Hungary

643
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
Forbidden

644
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Touche

645
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
So in Europe but this year's

646
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
Organized invasion

647
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
Are military age men

648
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,424
Yeah that's some of the boatload coming or not

649
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
95%

650
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
It's on

651
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,992
Morning settings

652
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Holyshit

653
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
That seems extra

654
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,880
I don't know

655
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Viktor Orban

656
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,744
Is your guy I don't know if that's great citation

657
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Dancing is he's made

658
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,888
Assisting refugees criminal act

659
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
Boy it's it seems like he's like you know what

660
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
That child rescue had some good policy

661
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,360
He's a good guy

662
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
You want the towel and you get the chest

663
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Okay

664
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
Stream

665
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Anyway if I bike

666
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Shootings that have happened

667
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
If you want to take a gun

668
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
Turns out Alex and his friends

669
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
Are going to be more deadly than the Vietcong

670
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
Let me tell you where this is going to end

671
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
Joe Biden tries to take

672
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
It's going to

673
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
Wipeout law enforcement in Lawton military

674
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
Civil War

675
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,176
The Vietnamese resistance in Vietnam looked

676
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,296
And then they were even successful to break the back of the country and in in

677
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,392
Get most people to do it

678
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Police involved will all be corrupt

679
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,536
That you will be worse than Mexico we will be a completely

680
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Spell state with

681
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Hundreds of thousands dead

682
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
Every few years

683
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
Just like we basically are becoming

684
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,592
Pic of the Tower of Babel can everybody take over

685
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Killing everybody

686
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,920
What about human world

687
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
Okay

688
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Yeah I know

689
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
I don't know

690
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,368
I'm not sure exactly what he's trying to intimate like is it that if

691
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Bible Hub

692
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
Put in better background check

693
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Regulations

694
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:00,096
Four guns that everybody will be murdered on the street or is it that he and his friend

695
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,680
Will start guerrilla warfare

696
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
That's what he

697
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
He's talking about he's

698
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:11,616
Talking about joining the Wolverines are going up in the mountains and running

699
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
The swamp

700
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,688
Fox 2.0

701
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
1776 2.0 no

702
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,320
That's over with

703
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,136
Seems like a little

704
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
I don't know

705
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
It doesn't make me feel all that come

706
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Ball

707
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
Going back to a lot of the ideas that

708
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
You know we're more popular Within

709
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
Some of these militia right-wing communities

710
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
Earlier on books like on intent

711
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
And the consequent

712
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Kinds of ideas

713
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Migrate to

714
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:48,992
Can popping up again a lot more volatile right now

715
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,088
That give up at the first hint of actual resistor

716
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,464
You know it is it is a little bit heartening for me to look back on the 6th

717
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
And remember

718
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
That win

719
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Push comes

720
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
To shove

721
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,400
Alex will say that it was never his idea and it was all the Liberals

722
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Asphalt Indiana

723
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
Guerrilla warfare from these assholes you know all those people

724
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:19,456
That's just

725
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
Because of the double rat.

726
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Proposition

727
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Okay

728
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
So

729
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Boy this isn't good

730
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
I'll just tell you that

731
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
There's a good setup for this clip this is good

732
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,816
Explain how this works

733
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Florida's would Africans religion

734
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
Strange man Europe

735
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
It doesn't sound right

736
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,080
Yeah I mean you're going to tell

737
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
They put 2,000

738
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Military-age man

739
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
Jobs

740
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
They start robbing you some of them

741
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,552
Now you hate black people

742
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Do you want to

743
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Annihilate

744
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,696
Join them

745
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Extermination

746
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
That's coming

747
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
I don't know if I would be susceptible to that sort of

748
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
The planned at the club

749
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:13,984
Cuz I see other solutions to problem

750
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
Confused entirely sure if there are these towns

751
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,640
The 500 people in 2002 emigrants come into it all man

752
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
With no jobs or whatever but

753
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,528
I feel like there could be some other

754
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Sort of

755
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,624
Structural ways that we could we could

756
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
Good deal with the issue

757
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,464
Let's go to buy a government works projects together

758
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
Get these people employed let's get me where Outlook get to her

759
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Consumer maintenance

760
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
I know this from the United States

761
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
Chicago in specific

762
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
Every bridge needs a little bit of work

763
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
That's true

764
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,056
That is true

765
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,408
Deteriorating quick

766
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
Get the government involved in

767
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,808
Inject a little bit of money everybody has a job

768
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,856
Said is that determine at this house

769
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Trick you into want

770
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
Take me to Annihilator population

771
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,744
Yeah I really feel like maybe

772
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
You don't need or maybe I feel like maybe your manufacturing reasons to

773
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
To do what you already want to

774
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
To do maybe

775
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
That's what I would that would be my history if you want to feel blameless about having those feelings already

776
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,200
If you're creating excuse to say that

777
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,784
That would probably become a national news story baby in the

778
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,392
Global news story Legacy Germany's government Merkel is just like

779
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,720
2000 only military rage

780
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,304
Small tiny town to 500 people

781
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
I know they're going to murder everyone

782
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
And they be like at the very least

783
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
This would call for a special session of Congress

784
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
At least one

785
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
What are the things that I think is really into

786
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
Everything is the Alex plays luck games with his

787
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:03,808
What he believes is going on pure you know like he'll say that the globalist believe that they're talking to a next

788
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
Dimensional being

789
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
I'm not saying I believe

790
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,744
What they believe I'm just here warning you what they believe

791
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
He does follow that up usually with now it's up

792
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
True well yeah but

793
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:21,472
Just to be totally clear here Alex is expressing that he literally believes he's fighting biblical devil

794
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,360
Some of the elite white people think you're going to be

795
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
No

796
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,968
Posthuman world

797
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,784
The Bible's the devil does not want any humans

798
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,600
Bible tells us the Devil comes to destroy God's creation

799
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
So Alex believe he's fighting the Christian

800
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
Biblical literal devil

801
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Question

802
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
Alex's fiala

803
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
So the devil

804
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
What's the astrology

805
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
Okay what happened

806
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
To their soul

807
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Do they still

808
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
Heaven and hellafied

809
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,080
Or is he going for all the souls in Heaven and Hell 2

810
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
That's a great question

811
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
And if so

812
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,688
How is it going to pull that one off

813
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Finally

814
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Should he sick

815
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
Being and killing all the human

816
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
And then what

817
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Or let's go another Direction

818
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
Let's say Alex's

819
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,280
Successful in vanquishing

820
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
Okay

821
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,656
What is it you do who takes over

822
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
All those people are just hanging out

823
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,336
Pre-K oz cup the infrastructure of Hell currently

824
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
Right and then how does that reshape

825
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Theology

826
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
Play the future is like

827
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
You have

828
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,936
Yeah the Old Testament or the New Testament and the Jones test

829
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
Almost all of the prophecy

830
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,288
Would like the revelations is

831
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,408
You don't even talk about God defeating the devil thousand years of Jesus's rain

832
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
It's just more like Alex did it

833
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
That's the end of Revelations is

834
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,112
Hey man it was a good thing God gave us Alex f****** joke

835
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:19,232
Last verse of the Bible is I'm not bragging but we did it guy

836
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,608
Just one Mission Hill Bible at all just a mission accomplished

837
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
That's it

838
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,704
Guess you're really quite understand

839
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
What

840
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,544
I don't know I just know

841
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,128
I just think it's really important to recognize that whatever he says stuff like

842
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,784
I'm not saying that I believe the stuff they believe that's him trying to hold on to some thread

843
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,344
Respectability and credibility with people who would call him

844
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,672
Nuts

845
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,744
Needs to recognize that really tough

846
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,048
You need to recognize he thinks it's

847
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,864
I know it is it is a little bit like how they

848
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
The older of articles about Rodger

849
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Sonar always

850
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Conspicuously like

851
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
He was a lobbyist

852
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,824
Close to Trump's Inner Circle and they never mentioned that

853
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,408
He hosted a show on Infowars for 2 years that is 8

854
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:14,272
News Outlet whose editorial position is staunchly anti devil

855
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,600
Anti-communism

856
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
Absolutely I guarantee said

857
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Bet the

858
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
Basic problem is the

859
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,536
I probably ever believed it

860
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Hideout

861
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,352
I don't know

862
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,912
I think that it would be interesting to like

863
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Like what the public conversation is

864
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,312
I'd like totally free speech Crusader ezotic Trump

865
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
Fans fighting

866
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
The devil

867
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Hooey

868
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
He's also super AC

869
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,344
Sarah interesting things that he tries to get too easy steak

870
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Some calls here on the show

871
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,208
It has astillas B conversation that has a color I'm not taking these

872
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
These racist feeling

873
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,560
Things you have and then redirecting them at the global

874
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
That's nice

875
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
No

876
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
2024 medium mass

877
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Political Express

878
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
I got red blood don't you think I see all this

879
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
Groups that I go

880
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
That's my animal side

881
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,712
Old times

882
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,552
The enemy is using that against us

883
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,648
Whatever we have to be aware of

884
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
That's the only way to defeat

885
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
This is an alien attack

886
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,304
UFOs real

887
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,776
I don't care they were just killing me

888
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
Birthdays are killing everybody

889
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
Boutonniere

890
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
Not totally

891
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,088
He's trying to make is essentially the he has this old timey racist program and get inside him

892
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
Here take that

893
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
And directed toward

894
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
Globalist

895
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Psyquel

896
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,744
No you should Rise Above It Maybe

897
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,328
Wrestle with those feelings as opposed to

898
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,424
I hate someone else has to be Evolution itself

899
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
That makes him racist

900
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Can't possibly be cold

901
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
I actually don't think that he was talkin

902
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
About like

903
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
Caveman days

904
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
I think he was talking about like when he was in high school because he constantly talks about how black people beat him up in high school

905
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,832
Talk about that all the time

906
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
I think you talkin about you

907
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
I think it's so ironic now with all the reports that we have from very credible sources and the government real

908
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
It's like

909
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
We see UFOs all the time

910
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,472
I got to be honest with you we see UFOs

911
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,520
All the goddamn type here

912
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
Types of Navy Pilots here's

913
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,848
Here's video here's everything

914
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
And Alex is like whoa whoa I don't believe in UFOs

915
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,480
If the devils are fighting a demon

916
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
The devil

917
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
Set the same time still

918
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
The functioning lettering ESO is you

919
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
Of course

920
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,000
Get some more let's make those ifo's

921
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Can I see what you say

922
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,168
So Alex this guy seems to be worried that the FBI is following his social media

923
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Announces response to does a little bit weird

924
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Hey Alex

925
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
I just want to prep

926
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
Message with

927
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
What Paul said in first Colossians

928
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
Because it's kind of scary

929
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
He said that

930
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
The powers of Darkness

931
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
We defeated on the cross

932
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
And that is

933
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
That is only hope right now

934
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
Look

935
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
The FBI show up in my house

936
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Iiii

937
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Have a Tik-Tok

938
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
Accountant

939
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,936
Snapchat and I basically preach the gospel in there

940
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
And I went into the vaccine

941
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,080
Nervous on the phone call to Beyonce lyrics

942
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
It's okay for the FBI's Realm of the Chinese now

943
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
Did you come out the gym at 8 she was hit salt

944
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:05,695
That does relax made that's okay that's a wildly man I'm so relaxed

945
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,303
Was worried about the FBI Vanessa American government's fbii now that I do there

946
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,887
Controlled by the Chinese and the Chinese just tell him to go rough

947
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,471
People up a little bit I don't know it what to believe about this

948
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Listcawler

949
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
He sounds a little skittish

950
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Emily

951
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Little bit

952
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,151
I don't believe that the FBI

953
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
I don't know if I believe the FBI showed up at

954
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
As if they did I believe it is posting more on that account then the keys let him off

955
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,439
Maybe the FBI wouldn't just walk around at the

956
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,743
Cast of the Chinese government yet

957
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
Scare him a little bit

958
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
Whatever the reality or non reality of this one visit is I'm guessing there's not going to be a follow-up visit they're not listening to him

959
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,239
Call idalia show

960
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:54,847
There's some delusional paranoia that's going on here and Alex is doing a great disservice

961
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,127
Who's listener by being like

962
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:00,223
Don't worry about it

963
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,783
What is the weather like

964
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
Deal with delusional paranoia he's like

965
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,719
We're not going to deal with the delusion whatsoever we're going to deal with the paranoia I'm going to try

966
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
You called Dowd

967
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,791
Of course the delusion is

968
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,351
I'm going to make you calm down but also make it

969
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Way worse

970
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
Whatever you're worried about

971
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:26,079
How much worse nuclear bombs coming

972
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
You worried about

973
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,711
The government your Bail Enforcement

974
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
Also and the New World Order

975
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,719
They're working with the spider leadership

976
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Play run by the literal.

977
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
Does the devil want to destroy alien

978
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,727
Alex

979
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,615
Makes an interesting point

980
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,663
And that is Victor China isn't

981
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
Communist

982
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
There is that which

983
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
Is a itching problem for Alex

984
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Because

985
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
Because of the calls them

986
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,671
Jack talks about a communist

987
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Chocolate

988
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
Country

989
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,447
Totalitarian dictatorship

990
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
Globalist

991
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:33,919
Muse The Leverage out the whole planet want to make an omelette with Warfarin

992
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
11 minutes timer

993
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,487
Which we absolutely have nothing resembling I'm going to rephrase this

994
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
In a way that works

995
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,047
For me which is at the test

996
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,143
Open ground for the globalist yeah and then we'll move on and I won't have to deal with

997
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:00,287
Pollution might as well just like neener neener neener I'm going to call him communist

998
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
What's tomorrow

999
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
Like that might as well have been his respond

1000
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,479
So you get another call and this guy is a story from a year ago

1001
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
That blows Alex is mine

1002
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Because it helps him

1003
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Demonize Muslim

1004
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
Locally in Knoxville

1005
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,975
A year ago April 8th we had a stabbing

1006
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,303
You can find it on the internet 3

1007
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Pilot

1008
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
That's a gas station

1009
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,935
3 pilot employees killed

1010
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Stabbing attack

1011
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
Knoxville

1012
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
I-40 truck stop

1013
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
Corsa got no coverage cuz it was a nice

1014
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,575
Article on the front page of the local newspaper a rag

1015
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,391
The Knoxville News Sentinel under the leadership

1016
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
The editor

1017
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
I wouldn't wipe my rear end with it

1018
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
Did read it though

1019
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,887
Coverage to the mother

1020
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
Of the stabbing

1021
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Stabber

1022
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,543
And she said that it he he was in

1023
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
It was not possible

1024
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,615
He could have done

1025
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,967
Dunwoody did so why are we not hearing about it what is the racial makeup

1026
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,295
He was a middle eastern

1027
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:20,159
Bingo Muslim who else wants

1028
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,975
I mean

1029
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
I'm not against all Muslims but give me a break

1030
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
They got a thing about killing women

1031
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Wow

1032
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
That's

1033
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
That's wild

1034
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Wow

1035
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
That's really wild

1036
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:37,567
In Alta Dena California last week two people were fatally stabbed on a zoom call and if it all

1037
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:42,687
There's a new story out of Michigan fourteen-year-old girls spent months planning to stab her friend in the woods

1038
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Guess you quote wanted to see

1039
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
See someone die

1040
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:49,599
Yet to hear this reported on Infowars we could do this all day but the point doesn't matter

1041
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:54,207
Stories are props for Alex and this is a prop for him to demonize intimate hatred towards Muslim

1042
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
I believe the colors also complaining things

1043
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
The claims

1044
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,351
In those articles

1045
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
That the guy

1046
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
Couldn't have been

1047
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
The person at the stabbing

1048
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
They were that he

1049
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Wouldn't have been

1050
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Involved in

1051
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Previous stabbing

1052
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,663
In a town called Billington initially people thought might have

1053
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
Open Connected

1054
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,551
He definitely wasn't in that other time

1055
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,087
Things about the reporting being

1056
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
He couldn't have been happy

1057
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
Yeah but you've got a group of

1058
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Put people to smear and Hate

1059
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
For the rest of your life cool

1060
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
Alex is like this

1061
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
Is exciting

1062
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,423
Year old story about a stabbing at a gas station

1063
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:40,543
Hooray let's talk about this forever media covered it up by putting it in the

1064
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,895
Front page of the local newspaper

1065
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
You can find about it

1066
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
If you want

1067
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,991
Anyway they decide to talk about it for quite a while

1068
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:55,647
Alex they went on to have follow-up articles on the front page of the local newspaper rag

1069
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
And they said

1070
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,743
The people who stopped him

1071
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,583
Who killed him and stopped him from killing people

1072
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
Investigated

1073
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
Cleared of any

1074
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
Wrongdoing

1075
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,335
Gail said should I be arrested for being at Yale

1076
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,943
Wow I'm glad you call that know about this we're pulling the Articles up now

1077
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
Islamic stabbed and killed three women

1078
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,551
Free

1079
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,879
Call Tim a victim holy

1080
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,439
I'm glad you called what's up

1081
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,839
That wow you can see here I'll expect little pieces of inaccurate information that a caller is passed along to him and then he writes his own

1082
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
Headlines about

1083
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,167
He's decided based on literally nothing

1084
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,263
This person who stabbed people at a Pilot station was motivated by his religious beliefs

1085
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
And because

1086
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
So mad about what

1087
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,847
Women being free because he's a Muslim

1088
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:53,503
This is all completely made up in based on nothing other than Alex's intense hatred towards people he sees as different from himself

1089
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Also

1090
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,087
This color is once again f****** up detail

1091
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,439
The articles in the paper after the stabbing incident were about whether or not the police

1092
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,487
For justified in using deadly force

1093
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
The stabber

1094
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,303
Ordered him to drop his weapon

1095
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,143
8 * and the police killed him when he failed to drop his weapon and he began to walk

1096
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
Towards the police car

1097
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,287
The news articles of this guy's referring to wear about the DA's determination that it was a Justified shooting

1098
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,359
Which isn't the same as being all was it right to

1099
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Whatever

1100
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
I'm looking assholes

1101
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
I'm noticing the length

1102
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,991
Pics of time we're spending on this

1103
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Call verse

1104
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
This is the one that was like

1105
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,367
The Chinese are crony capitalist country

1106
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Like move on

1107
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
It does seem like he moved on from that awful

1108
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:38,815
Oh wait you had a story about someone who you think is a Muslims to having somebody I get right now this is exciting

1109
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,167
Considering discovering that information about China is seeing is that China is

1110
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Maine book

1111
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Man really

1112
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
That could shake his entire world

1113
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,311
You should really spend more time

1114
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
Thinking on that

1115
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Confirms is bias

1116
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,199
C-SPAN

1117
00:49:55,711 --> 00:50:01,855
Symposium that Alex did about about 9/11 haha

1118
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
And one of his

1119
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
Did he make

1120
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
Is that

1121
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
It somehow

1122
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,815
The globalist are working against China

1123
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:17,215
They were like they were against each other

1124
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
I've gotcha

1125
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,175
To be like really intensely anti-immigrant

1126
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
Announce its

1127
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
Disgustingly anti-muslim

1128
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
And boring.

1129
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,063
Paint by numbers nonsense about

1130
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,831
Is b*******

1131
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,111
And then

1132
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
Is just disgusting on the 24th

1133
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,719
Some like weird

1134
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Pedophile stuff

1135
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
All about

1136

Holding your children

1137
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
And as soon as you figure that out these are demonic

1138
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
Monsters

1139
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,727
Most of them are pedophiles

1140
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:00,735
Silence is above the political divide an illusion

1141
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,271
To this guy

1142
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855

What is a mid-level Democrat state senator for mid-level

1145
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,327
Got to be any elected official

1146
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
I mean I don't know I would

1147
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,239
Could you call a State Rep mid-level an alderman

1148
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Chicago mid-layer

1149
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799

Yeah I just find this unacceptable and stupid

1155
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
I don't have time for it

1156
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
We get to

1157
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
Texting story

1158
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
This is a story about

1159
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Allegedly

Black lives matter

1167
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,319
Watch people inside a grocery

1168
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
Store 100

1169
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
Soros's

1170
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,207
Apparently paying them to do that sounds

1171
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,511
True about keeping us shutdown

1172
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
Did somebody do something this over-the-top in this crazy

1173
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,495
Because they've been told by Soros to go do what they're paid to do it

1174
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,503
Newport.com

1175

We're shutting stuff

1178
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
Sh

1179
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
And they kept him in there for a long time

1180
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,655
Going to reporter for wroc

1181
00:52:54,911 --> 00:53:01,055
See who's on the CM theater Framingham the story is completely fake and a racist live being perpetuated by right-wing media to attack backlight

1182
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
Is matter

1183
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
More likely

1184
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
Kayla green

1185
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,199
Wegmans closed doors and customers were capped

1186
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,503
Since I temporarily but we're let out soon after

1187
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:14,879
Protesters never entered the store protesters are currently listening to music and eating pizza in the parking lot

1188
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
Nobody is quotes

1189
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,487
Trapped inside every one of these

1190
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
Text protest I've been to have been

1191
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Sometimes

1192
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Overly

1193
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
Incredibly

1194
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,263
Protesters were having a memorial demonstration on the anniversary of the day Rochester police arrested

1195
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,567
Ultimately led to his dad

1196
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,919
But instead of discussing any of that reality Alex just says that soros's pain

1197
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:43,807
The good lie white people of the country to make them feel bad and stay inside a grocery store or something

1198
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Nonsense

1199
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,159
It is it is kind of really a good

1200
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Example of

1201
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
That kind of

1202
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Going

1203
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
You know that

1204
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,071
Propaganda method of going at your enemy strength

1205
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,095
Instead of their week

1206
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
Natsu no like

1207
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,143
When he goes after like

1208
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:01,983
Why would somebody do something so over-the-top and ridiculous

1209
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
Because they wouldn't

1210
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,311
This is too over-the-top of Earth

1211
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Haha

1212
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,895
I will just cut past all of that by thing Soros

1213
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,247
Done now I will say that this next clip of worry

1214
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,087
Because even more over-the-top also made me think

1215
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:21,695
Mount Everest and blow it up

1216
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
He starts

1217
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,047
Acting like they committed like criminal kidnapped you were

1218
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:31,935
Under federal state law against

1219
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,751
Kidnapping unlawful restraint

1220
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
Smuggling a person

1221
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,871
O.j. Simpson went to jail

1222
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,663
4 / 24

1223
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,759
These are folks you found out where counterfeiting to stuff and he was pissed at him

1224
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
Mustang

1225
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:54,719
Are you worried he's going to o.j. me

1226
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:03,935
Protest in Rochester

1227
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
Kidnapped

1228
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,007
Wrongly arrested

1229
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,543
Did Vitor

1230
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
If Alex was there

1231
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,151
He probably would started swinging

1232
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,967
Occupied government aren't Claus

1233
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
Meaningless now

1234
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
That was

1235
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,831
A week ago

1236
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,695
Completely different conversation and I forgot really good at the time

1237
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,463
Yeah

1238
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,279
Started swinging on people man

1239
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,327
Knocking people out left and right

1240
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
And then

1241
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
Then

1242
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
The media

1243
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,215
The media would have called it a race war

1244
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
So they go to a grocery store

1245
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
Wegmans grocery store

1246
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,663
100

1247
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,063
Call the police

1248
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,159
What was that

1249
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,743
I got an hour

1250
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,071
But you have a couple hundred people can't walk me inside a grocery store

1251
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
I have to go somewhere

1252
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
No but I'm going to get Mama

1253
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,751
Grocery store

1254
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,967
This is out of control

1255
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
Ha

1256
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
This is what I'm saying I'm not worried about them

1257
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
I'm starting a guerrilla warfare campaign

1258
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,903
Because we're at the level of

1259
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
Like

1260
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,463
I'm not worried about Mark Wahlberg

1261
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,279
Actually stopping 911 do you understand like

1262
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,863
You blustery as well I would punch them in like

1263
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
The fuk up

1264
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
Yeah

1265
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,727
This this formulation to of like

1266
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
Because we keep

1267
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Putting up with it like

1268
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
So the solution

1269
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,359
Stop putting up with

1270
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
Protest

1271
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,711
Right right I mean like obviously that's the message

1272
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:58,111
We stamp out any and all protest particularly related

1273
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,135
We are ones that are

1274
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,463
Central to Nan

1275
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Straight white

1276
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,047
Christian males related issues

1277
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
Because they're Soros instigated

1278
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
Of course

1279
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,727
I don't know it doesn't seem to 17 Gray

1280
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,007
See

1281
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
Did you understand

1282
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
These people do understand

1283
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
Actually never

1284
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,431
I should I should end everything

1285
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Actually

1286
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
Eyebrows

1287
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
I think I can

1288
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,807
I think the only explanation I can come up with for like

1289
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,647
Maintain the Dignity of Alex's listeners is like

1290
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,695
They have to just think he's

1291
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,719
Telling the truth

1292
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,791
Like yeah I can't imagine listening to this habit

1293
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,327
A kernel of skepticism

1294
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,631
Maintaining any illusion

1295
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,679
That he knows what he's talking about

1296
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
You covered this story

1297
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,847
Found the like pictures of it you found the explanation for

1298
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,639
What was going on at this Wegmans

1299
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
And how Alex is

1300
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:57,247
For some reason imagining people would call it a race war if you started fighting

1301
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,783
His way out of the store right

1302
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
You have to spec

1303
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,647
Okay this is about you man this isn't about reality

1304
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,511
This isn't about the story of those paper articles are written

1305
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
Directly by

1306
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:15,167
I saw Rose haha did you know that 98% of all newspaper articles in the Main Street group

1307
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,215
We're written directly by George

1308
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,799
I read that in one of the 2%

1309
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
True

1310
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,759
This Is Us on Facebook and Twitter as a good thing randomly do grocery store

1311
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,087
A black people white people United inside

1312
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,791
How did the whole building and the emergency exit and wouldn't let people out

1313
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
Yo still

1314
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
47

1315
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
This is

1316
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,479
Disgusting

1317
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Wow.

1318
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,135
Globalstar I need to start arresting them racketeering

1319
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
What

1320
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:13,535
Anyway I'm not sure there's enough protesters there to surround a building a Wegmans

1321
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:17,631
They're not usually small stores are usually fairly big

1322
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,679
Pictures of the Gathering it was not a giant

1323
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Mobdro

1324
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
I also in reality Wegmans

1325
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:26,847
Close the door to their store out of fear of the protesters there any decisions

1326
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:31,711
Complain about to be directed to Wegmans customer corporate office or whatever the f***

1327
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,783
The reason the protesters chose this location for their protest

1328
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
What is that Wegmans uses

1329
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,111
Uniform Rochester Police Officers for

1330
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,415
Security and their protest

1331
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
For the firing of the officers

1332
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,487
Who were involved in the Daniel Peru case

1333
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,023
It all makes total sense

1334
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,303
It's not random

1335
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,119
The reason they showed up there was not random

1336
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
And I would

1337
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,679
Pretend that it's random

1338
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
And very racist

1339
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,031
What's the equivalent

1340
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,591
This is a bunch of black people and white people

1341
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
I guess looks like there's some brown people there

1342
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,431
That are literally

1343
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:06,271
Randomly at random people at a grocery store

1344
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,647
The old lady in a walker looks like he's about to have a heart attack

1345
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,767
And then she tries to get out the back and then yell at her

1346
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Again

1347
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,167
And this is just the beginning of it hundreds of people

1348
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,959
Grocery store

1349
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
Welfare Queens

1350
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,687
You were like 400 lb

1351
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
You wouldn't last ten minutes in Africa

1352
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,063
Whoa whoa whoa

1353
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,599
Weird

1354
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
Wild

1355
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,695
That little to clear Alex

1356
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,999
That's tough to back away from

1357
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
Yeah

1358
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
Tough tobacco it's outrageous

1359
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:55,423
Yeah yeah yeah

1360
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,703
Well wow

1361
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Well there's one of them

1362
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
Yeah

1363
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,055
One of many just on this episode

1364
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Review

1365
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
Flagrant races

1366
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
What's that's pretty

1367
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
It's pretty much

1368
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
That's two weeks

1369
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
It's jazz

1370
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
That's pretty pretty embarrassing

1371
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Yeah

1372
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
I don't know

1373
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,415
The stories dumb

1374
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,487
Our time on this Earth is Wegmans grocery

1375
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,023
Restore story

1376
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,071
A lot of time talking about how I am

1377
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,351
Infowars may be gone soon

1378
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,471
I didn't say there was no protest about racial Justice that ever random

1379
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,775
No and there's not even that

1380
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,055
Daily occurrence

1381
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,615
And there's nothing that Alex will ever deem acceptable

1382
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:42,015
Of course not there's no version of it that Alex would ever see has like

1383
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Something that's

1384
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
Bringing attention to Anna Borden

1385
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,367
Mobile Bud like you wouldn't

1386
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,903
It doesn't exist

1387
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
Yeah

1388
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,535
It would always be some kind of a Soros education in order to create division in

1389
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
Society of make white people feel bad

1390
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,399
And that's what I was kind of talking about that

1391
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
Beginning this episode where everything is just kind of boring

1392
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,727
Yeah but he's just

1393
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,847
These are just Alex Jones tricks

1394
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,639
Just racism on

1395
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
Autopilot

1396
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
F****** Boggle

1397
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,991
Disappointed

1398
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,855
Expect

1399
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
Yeah

1400
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,463
While we have it

1401
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
Yeah this is just like

1402
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,303
These people cannot be at all

1403
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,143
In perspective whatsoever if you can have racism on autopilot

1404
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Explicit right

1405
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Like at no point

1406
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,519
Time does he ever like sit down and go

1407
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,591
What I say come off as super racist

1408
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,175
It's interesting to me to imagine like a listener who's hearing

1409
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
Like particular that last clip

1410
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,855
He's talking about these Welfare Queen the 400lb

1411
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,927
That's weird but maybe you're somebody who's

1412
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:57,535
Inundated with shity right-wing media that's where that's where we live

1413
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:01,375
Why did you say you wouldn't last a day in Africa

1414
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
Weird

1415
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:06,751
Yeah why why why was that where you adding adding all of that

1416
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:14,175
I can't imagine being not being like

1417
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,735
I mean if you were Reagan voter UK

1418
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,783
Can't be mad about Welfare Queen at this

1419
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
I'm not sure Alex loves

1420
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,183
Hey you loves using Reagan's racist talking voice

1421
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,279
Be gone soon we've been hearing this

1422
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:34,655
For quite a while and I grow weary of it I'm running out of gas now I can play this

1423
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Bikes

1424
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
Stuff about it being gone all the time

1425
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
Except

1426
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,799
He makes a squid metaphor

1427
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:47,455
That goes too long and I find it interesting like a good school

1428
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,647
Any idea of work

1429
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Let me just tell you this

1430
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,767
Do not sit there and

1431
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
Infowars

1432
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
Be here forever

1433
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,863
About a lot of classy family

1434
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
That had cancer and was dying

1435
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
Are you just here

1436
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:12,287
They were one week got their Affairs in order

1437
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,615
So manly stovetop so feminine so dumb

1438
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,407
They just died make no big deal about it

1439
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,455
The body to science and stuff like

1440
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,759
What is stoic

1441
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,039
Estimate my ancestor

1442
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,879
I'd like to point out that I'm really glad that Alex did make that caveat

1443
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
But that's not me

1444
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,999
Yeah I'm not that person I'm going to go to I'm going to go down

1445
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,535
Whining

1446
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,911
God

1447
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
I will do any

1448
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,455
But America has cancer in this operation

1449
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,991
Globalist

1450
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,295
Squid attached to us

1451
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
Knowing on our face

1452
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,671
I just let it sit there

1453
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,719
Can dogs get their order

1454
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,327
I'm laying eggs real fast Escape

1455
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,655
We'll just see how they do getting caught in the hole

1456
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,031
Are you asleep

1457
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
Analogy

1458
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,199
So I need that

1459
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,503
Ensuring the future

1460
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,295
Continue

1461
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:31,135
Possible future

1462
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
And

1463
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:36,511
We've eaten by a monster so off-the-charts so crazy now

1464
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,535
But there's a good chance

1465
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,959
Musketeers a pressure light

1466
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
Carry out this Mission will be gone

1467
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,335
Didn't he just say like when he got back from his last weird vacation

1468
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
Florida bed like

1469
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
All the weight

1470
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
Had been lifted from him and eat

1471
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:58,015
Completed his mission

1472
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:03,135
I had a good week where the burden wasn't there and that was back and I really wish the globalist would just f******

1473
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:12,351
Nothing in Connecticut made me feel like I want to die and that Infowars will be around forever

1474
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:17,983
Connecticut whatever give me the impression that Infowars maybe going out of business

1475
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
To think that

1476
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,567
The metaphor gear the squid

1477
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,383
The squid is beat that the detached Infowars is

1478
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
Sandy Hook lawsuit

1479
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:32,063
Paxinos how far they can nibble before it hits the Carotid right would be once his finances become public or they get discovered

1480
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:37,183
People realize what he's really into

1481
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:41,023
Laying eggs

1482
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,351
Is that can either be like I'm trying to give money to

1483
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,143
Other organizations are on

1484
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,471
Hiding money in my dad's business

1485
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,031
He's got tomorrow

1486
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,591
Love life suicide

1487
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,639
It wasn't suicide

1488
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,687
I literally have no more fear

1489
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,527
I've been through this so long I've done so much that I don't fear death

1490
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,063
Out there anything I may lose

1491
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,367
Call family I may lose my children

1492
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,719
Bill Gates

1493
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,023
But you got from me

1494
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,583
Total commitment

1495
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:19,423
I will fight just because

1496
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,103
Like this at 11 like this this long

1497
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,223
You don't just not care about them killing you don't just not care about

1498
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,015
You start getting the point where

1499
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:41,439
No give you my word that I will be as focused and hardcore as I can until the very end

1500
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,487
But I need financial support

1501
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,023
Yeah it's

1502
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,351
It's weird I would I would pray that

1503
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Iowa

1504
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,423
Would have all of my support dry up

1505
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,751
If I ever get to the point where I speak that model

1506
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,543
Firebird

1507
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:01,151
You know just doing this at the level that I've done it I'm not afraid to die

1508
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,967
I won't let you go out like that

1509
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,247
About but I will

1510
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:11,903
Very much need you to check me if I ever getting close to that level of blowhard already

1511
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,487
Put on a boat I'll take care of you Godfather style it'll be

1512
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,255
Be great

1513
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,791
This is embarrassing

1514
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,583
Yeah that's not good

1515
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,887
The squids out

1516
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
I believe he's a

1517
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,751
Fish in the metaphor I think that's how far I've gotten with the metaphor I think he's a

1518
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,287
The fish feed

1519
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,103
I think he did say that

1520
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,919
Say that he was putting out eggs he realized he had to be something

1521
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,687
Laid eggs

1522
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,551
Yeah it's for a second

1523
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Yeah

1524
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:45,951
This is the problem with Alex and protracted Medical

1525
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,231
So Alex

1526
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,303
Some bad news here on the 24th

1527
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,071
The made a ruler

1528
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Who's the big deal

1529
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,727
Breaking overturning

1530
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
Concealed carry.

1531
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,527
Stream media that they fear the standing of the Court

1532
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,319
Cuz nobody calls the bluff and left

1533
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,367
Is Buffalo in US

1534
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
Stampeding us

1535
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
Crazy

1536
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
Imperious

1537
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
Get on the offense

1538
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,119
Across the border

1539
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
Do you like Ted Cruz

1540
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
Everybody else it there

1541
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Don't

1542
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
Do like Ted

1543
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,103
That's enough

1544
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,455
Don't forget

1545
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
Is clunky want

1546
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:46,623
Yeah it's a go after them for that'll do it

1547
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,647
You got them

1548
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,463
Man it's interesting how he pretends they didn't have hearing

1549
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,999
Nobody ever calls

1550
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,023
What's the elapsed

1551
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,655
Bluff you know like nobody's ever like we refused to sit a Supreme Court Justice until

1552
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:04,799
Never been like all we got to put pressure on the Supreme Court by

1553
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,615
Removing and replacing all of the

1554
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Cool

1555
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Cool guys

1556
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Also

1557
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
This is 9th Court ruling

1558
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,783
Has said

1559
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,367
If I recall correctly let me pull up the exact wording of it

1560
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:25,279
There is no right to carry arms openly in public nor is any such right within the scope of the second

1561
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,351
Yeah that's what the US court judge J

1562
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,375
Barbie

1563
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
I said

1564
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:37,311
I would be hard-pressed to find the wording within the Second Amendment that's like yeah and carry them in the leg

1565
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,455
Something that I would think that Alex would be like

1566
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,247
It's over

1567
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:51,135
Yeah that's the slippery slope right and he's already said the Supreme Court isn't going to ride specialist

1568
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,159
Shouldn't this be at

1569
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
The point where now like his

1570
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:58,303
You know Vietcong thing from earlier there weren't any laws anymore anyways.

1571
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,607
Government

1572
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,143
Institutional

1573
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
Alright

1574
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
What are we going to do

1575
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:10,847
Really talk about this story as much as you would think it should be

1576
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,919
The most important stories in Urdu

1577
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
Should lose it

1578
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,527
The miac report came out any makes such a stink about it

1579
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
So long

1580
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,391
Some weirdos garlic a YouTube show

1581
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,159
For an hour

1582
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,463
About like trying to make people afraid of

1583
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,767
Stop at the border and I didn't care

1584
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,559
Because I got a little bit deeper into

1585
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
Do this next

1586
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,351
The interview

1587
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:38,239
I thought it was it was different and a little bit more interesting and

1588
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,287
Is that

1589
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,151
Is brother whose name I refuse to learn is on

1590
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
That's right

1591
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:49,247
To me it is he's on cuz he's got some news about Kobe

1592
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,927
Information it's a breaking exclusively Gateway pundit. Com

1593
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
Location

1594
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,279
Origin of covid-19 pandemic identified

1595
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,863
Between two of China's biological warfare facility

1596
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,471
Apparently situation where there was a

1597
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495
The cluster of cases

1598
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,799
Israelite of covid-19 in an area that

1599
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
Geographically between

1600
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:18,431
The Wuhan Institute of virology and another lab in Wuhan

1601
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
Put those pieces together man

1602
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,759
Wait it was in between the two

1603
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,575
Geographically in between the two like on the

1604
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,599
On the street

1605
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,903
The neighborhood oh okay

1606
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,439
See what happened was

1607
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
Obviously

1608
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,279
People going back and forth between those I am sure

1609
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
And they were coughing on people

1610
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
Right

1611
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
You proved it

1612
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,911
So the place they stop for gas

1613
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,215
What is where the covid outbreak

1614
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:47,615
Started he's solved this case I got to say I got to give it up to Jim half-brother

1615
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,895
Really I really

1616
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
Agatha Christie

1617
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,455
This one

1618
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:57,599
I read the article on gay way but it's going to dismiss this and be like oh f*** yourself your mom's brother

1619
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,415
But there's actually a really interesting

1620
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,463
Peace for that

1621
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:07,583
Just demonstrates how these people do their dirty work

1622
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:13,727
That area that's really really dark or this is Sting signifies the most cases

1623
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:18,335
Is between a couple biological warfare facilities

1624
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,383
Editorialize in there a little bit better

1625
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:25,247
EZ's Diddy's describing a map where there is shaded clusters where

1626
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,807
There were early instances of

1627
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:33,183
What is the

1628
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,535
We started reporting Institute of virology

1629
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Last year

1630
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:42,655
And look like yeah this is what's going on

1631
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,959
Stockton was released from there

1632
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,495
And then

1633
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:51,615
Near that is another entity

1634
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,639
Preparation

1635
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,407
Destitute

1636
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,479
BP is a yellow Square on that map

1637
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,807
These two facilities

1638
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
Is where

1639
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,159
They're saying

1640
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,255
A number of initial cases

1641
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
So

1642
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,399
How far away

1643
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
You know

1644
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,959
I guess more evidence.

1645
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:20,031
This thing wasn't just us something that was natural

1646
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,871
Food market

1647
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:30,015
Between the Black Star there in the yellow box

1648
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,575
So I've got some issues with this map

1649
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:37,951
Eventually I found a very packed a black box that yellow square and a red.

1650
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,583
No I mean like whatever is markers on a map

1651
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:50,239
My first issue is that there are four additional clusters of early cases that are nowhere near either lab and at least 10 other report

1652
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,799
Forged inspectors also outside the area

1653
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,335
The gym hops brother is focusing

1654
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,967
In theory it would be just as easy to argue that someone got infected in one of those other clusters and brought

1655
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,503
The condition back to the neighborhood that hop

1656
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,271
Focusing on

1657
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,343
From the information that he's providing there's literally no way

1658
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:11,743
That he could prove otherwise you know you bringing multiple points of fact that would undermine his

1659
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,815
His argument but on the other hand have you considered don't worry about

1660
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,119
No

1661
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:23,007
The second major issue from a study in the international Journal of geo-information

1662
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:27,871
Geographic data from a medical help-seeking app called weibo

1663
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,199
The data isn't meant to be used in the way that Jim's brother is using

1664
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
It is not it's it's misused

1665
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
Only on 10

1666
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
Yeah it's

1667
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:40,415
Tracking the people who reached out for help through this app

1668
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,023
Is datapoints maybe not for this

1669
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
This is

1670
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:51,167
The third problem is at the map that publishing on Gateway pundit isn't the map from that journal article

1671
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,447
Call orbit leasing the only

1672
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:53,983
The map

1673
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,775
Closest of theirs is the one that depict

1674
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,799
Weibo helps

1675
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,615
Secret prior to January 18th 2020

1676
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,431
Gateway pundit doesn't include the subsequent Maps

1677
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:05,503
Depicting weibo Seekers from January 19th

1678
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
20th

1679
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,807
Which shows the distribution going

1680
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Way towards

1681
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,623
The area's nowhere near the lab

1682
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,903
Apps that they're focusing on

1683
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,439
Nor do they even bring up the map

1684
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,719
From January 21st

1685
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,767
22nd which shows more of the same

1686
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,327
Shifting away from that hot spot that he was

1687
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,887
Decided to cherry-pick data

1688
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,167
And just make it darken

1689
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,215
Okay so then in this case

1690
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,239
Here's my

1691
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
Here's what I've got four

1692
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,847
So some dudes

1693
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,383
Shuffling

1694
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
Dangerous covid

1695
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,479
Back from Lab to lab

1696
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,039
They stopped at a stop at a gas station

1697
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,343
Accidentally drop a vial

1698
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,391
Right it explodes that caused

1699
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:49,535
But that's a small out right it's just one vial so then they go to the other places and that's where they

1700
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
The big vial

1701
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,583
Tossed out of the car

1702
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,631
Interesting plot for a book

1703
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,935
Or something but I don't have tickets

1704
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,727
I've written it down

1705
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,799
My final problem is that according to Google Maps

1706
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,615
Jim Hopper brother his mislabeled the map he

1707
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:10,271
It appears that that yellow square that he's talking about to signify the biological preparations Institute Shore

1708
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,855
That's actually the biological preparations Institute marketing

1709
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,159
Center

1710
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,047
Advertise

1711
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:26,655
Biological preparation

1712
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,959
Attitude is about 25km South

1713
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,495
Of where they have it marked on the map

1714
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,799
If you actually use the correct location

1715
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:36,895
There are no clusters

1716
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:42,527
I wanted I want to throw baseballs at these people really hard

1717
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,623
A little while looking at the map and asking myself questions about like

1718
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,671
Is this entity exact

1719
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,975
Actually like is this

1720
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:54,047
Took a little while to unravel but this is like

1721
01:17:54,303 --> 01:18:00,191
Pretty basic stuff that they didn't even consider or they did consider and decided to lie about having service of making Gerard

1722
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:05,567
This is that one situation of what was what's the name of those places where there's the

1723
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,871
Institute and the

1724
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,967
University or whatever and the heat they keep mixing them out of stock

1725
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,111
It's the same thing where they just keep mixing up the dumb stuff in their life

1726
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,415
Nobody's ever going to follow up on this except

1727
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,791
That is a very good chance

1728
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
It's the day just didn't even

1729
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,143
They just saw like

1730
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,727
Why would that no one's going to follow up on this except dance

1731
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,775
So sloppy and embarrassingly

1732
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,847
But this is business like gatewaypundits editorial

1733
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,431
That's what they was good enough

1734
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
To be put out

1735
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,247
Exclusive

1736
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,087
And then come on Alex's show at the end and ramble about it

1737
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,111
Wake me up even

1738
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:57,023
Problems that I was able to find with the way they were using that map from the journal itself

1739
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
To what they were doing

1740
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:02,655
Even if you did have the right location there were problems

1741
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,935
But that is a different

1742
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,983
Location then they're pretending

1743
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,287
They just comical that fart

1744
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,311
That's stupid

1745
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:15,711
You're like the sigma five of propaganda let you know how

1746
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:19,807
Scientists are like there's a one-in-a-million chance that we're not one hundred percent correct

1747
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,623
3 is like 1000 or whatever

1748
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Your life

1749
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,207
If there's a point in propaganda where it's like

1750
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,999
Only dams going to care about that

1751
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:34,143
So he might not if he doesn't accidentally curious about it

1752
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:40,543
Just make this boring enough Jim hosta brother

1753
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,311
Talk about it

1754
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,127
Astride

1755
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
6 / 3 is dead in like the New York

1756
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:52,831
I don't know man it's going to spend a little bit of time looking at that

1757
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
Burned me out at

1758
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,391
Tiny bit between Lee like sort of

1759
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
Just very

1760
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,487
Constant boring

1761
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
Racism

1762
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Immigrant

1763
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,583
Bashing

1764
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
You know that

1765
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
I was like

1766
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
I'm out

1767
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:13,824
I'm out that late that made me miss Rodger Stone he showed up in the fourth hours should I don't usually watch

1768
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
Before that

1769
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,688
Maybe we'll get it next week

1770
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
Boring

1771
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,736
He sucks

1772
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:25,088
He's boring now he doesn't do anything I think ever since he got that part

1773
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
He's just not the

1774
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,720
Just not the same man I mean you know I get it

1775
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,488
Write like

1776
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,024
You got all the adrenaline of life

1777
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,632
Am I going to go to jail am I going to go to jail and then you get a pardon and you're like well now what do I do

1778
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,912
Do it feels like

1779
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
The definition of one

1780
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:46,336
Once Bitten Twice Shy

1781
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:50,944
I will try and get attention to myself as best I can maybe do some

1782
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,344
Publicity stunt things from time to time

1783
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:02,208
Oh yeah Larry klayman if I get a chance to do

1784
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,024
I don't know

1785
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
Stretch

1786
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
Beginning

1787
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,424
Michelle

1788
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,704
Is there even value in Taka

1789
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,824
I'm about it the reason is because I don't think a lot of it brings much new to the table

1790
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:21,152
I think with Jim hoft brother and talkin about

1791
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,176
Some of these Pacific

1792
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,224
Instances of things he brings up

1793
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,016
Maybe there's a little bit

1794
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,064
Coverage of

1795
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,856
Princeton's the shooting

1796
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:33,440
He's all in service of anti-muslim rhetoric

1797
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,744
It's all inside of

1798
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,376
Yeah there's nothing there that you don't see in the aftermath of so many other tragic events

1799
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,168
If you look at Alex's coverage

1800
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
Kind of

1801
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,056
I don't know it might it makes me sad that you

1802
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,336
Still get away with this

1803
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,664
Yeah it is it is one of those things where sometimes

1804
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
We doing up

1805
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,456
Episode that I want

1806
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:59,040
In court as like a this isn't a First Amendment issue

1807
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,064
This is Mal

1808
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
We can prove Mal

1809
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,136
Listen to this s***

1810
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,440
Now you're going to have to listen to about

1811
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,512
I think about 1,000 hours of knowledge fight at this point

1812
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,536
So

1813
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
But you'll get there

1814
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:15,680
We'll get the conviction on this one

1815
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,776
Anyway Jordan will be back

1816
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
Indeed we will.

1817
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,104
Until then we have website

1818
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,152
We have a website its knowledge fight.com

1819
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,176
Yes we're also want

1820
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:30,016
But we are on Twitter that knows Irvine not go to bed Jordan we are also on Facebook

1821
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:36,416
We are officially in Dallas if you could please find a local charity or Bellefonte in your area to help out people doing

1822
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:42,816
How's work still Pledge on the altar

1823
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,584
God

1824
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,632
To try to force Alex Jones

1825
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,656
To eat fake fruit

1826
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,288
Alex
