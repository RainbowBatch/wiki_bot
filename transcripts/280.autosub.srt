Jordan

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
What was the last time you got a license

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,112
Pizza slice you got just a slice

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
Yep I did I was walking around I had to go clear out to some stuff from my old apartment

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,792
When you move

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
It's never really done

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,376
And so I was walking back and

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
And I spotted

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
But I like along the way

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
And I went in and got his lights

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,264
It was pretty good

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,568
It wasn't as good as I remember that but it was for

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
Have you ever had a body

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640

Don't forget

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
They're not good

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:01:00,160
Chicago if you want

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
Free drink

23
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
Not a bonus

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,376
$3 and a lifetime of regrets

25
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,936
Just for drunk people downtown in Wrigley Hill

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
That's mostly with that

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
Apache location is for

28
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:19,104

29
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:25,504
Jordan Brenner lot about Alex Jones

30
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
It doesn't matter cuz we're doing Wacky Wednesday on Friday today

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Bunch of stuff from this old apartment

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
And also I've

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,864
Rejoined the gym near my house

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,216
The gym started taking a pilates class love which is

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Out-of-character as hell

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,104
But in it you know so they're still there still some like adjustments

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
To the move happy

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
I felt like a good way for us to

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
To get back into

40
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
Good natural rhythm

41
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
A good a good

42
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
Funtime would be to have a

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
Little trip down to Project Camelot lamp

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Because

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
Jordan

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
This Old House

47
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
Today

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
Has gone back

49
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,400
To prison and interviewed Mark races

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,544
Weather in Brisbane

51
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
Interview

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Time

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Bark

54
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Which absolutely

55
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
Enter here is an out-of-context drop

56
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
From Today Show

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
Clowns are not reliable

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
I agree

59
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Ivory

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,024
Cancel

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
I love it

62
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,144
That's a very important point

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
You know beneath all that

64
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,800
You can't rely on a club that you can't trust them

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
Obviously

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Help you move

67
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,952
So unreliable clumsy

68
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
And I believe that we should start this episode off by giving a shout-out

69
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
Supporting the shower a night out

70
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,520
Your nail polish

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312

Text someone who donated on a little bit of an elevated level

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,608
So thank you so much you are now a globulin

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites a bucket

80
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:07,808
Donated on a little bit of even elevated level about that

81
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Thank you so much

82
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
You are now a technocrat

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Don't get mad until your brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

84
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
Has a Caribbean

85
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591

89
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Come through

90
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
It allows me to take and talk about

91
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Interview Mark Richards

92
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,103
We are a clone positive show we are not alone agnostic

93
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Podcast

94
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,943
We have no stated that this look like

95
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
Jordan today this is super interesting

96
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Different

97
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
Sort of vibe Huron project

98
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
I wanted to bring that up

99
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Audio stink

100
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,095
Yeah I don't know what's going on I don't know why carries adios very

101
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
But it is

102
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
And we just going to have to deal

103
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
I don't know either

104
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
There's no way for me to clean it up and I wouldn't even if I could I already spent

105
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,175
Forever preparing us episode

106
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,343
Carrie has a new graphic that looks like something out of a I don't know 1993

107
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,951
PC video game itself

108
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Apes

109
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
Lemmings adjacent old Star Wars

110
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,983
Sims games

111
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
It's pretty good the ones that were like first person shooter quality of graphics

112
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
That for Mark Richards

113
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,551
Looks like a triangular spacecraft coming in pretty strong and there's also

114
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
A disclaimer

115
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
No cuz it's girl through again much like Star Trek

116
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,583
Visual View

117
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
The disclaimer

118
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
Because of the convoluted nature of the case against Mark I miss that

119
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
I will say

120
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:45,759
The case against Mark is not convoluted convoluted

121
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Convoluted

122
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
Pretty great mall

123
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,439
Because of the convoluted nature of the case against mark

124
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
And as a journalist I'm not allowed to

125
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,839
Use a recording device of any kind not audio or video

126
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,191
Forced to rely on a dull pencil to scribble notes that the same time is asking question

127
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,287
I mainly depend on my memory for reporting what Mark says during our interview

128
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,663
It's entirely possible for me to get something's wrong just slightly incorrect

129
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,039
However since my work is heavily depended on my ability to retain information in whatever form

130
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:25,439
I have overtime come to fine for the most part my memory recall is surprisingly accurate

131
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,143
When it comes to any inaccuracies I take full responsibility and simply asked you understand

132
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
The constraints within which I work

133
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Lastly any individuals mentioned here are based on

134
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,991
Not responsible for the below nor for their accuracy

135
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
Further research and sources are available on my

136
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,415
Address Mark Richards to follow up an overview

137
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
Of the cases he remembers it to supplement the following

138
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
This should be very helpful to augment

139
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
My effort below

140
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
Once I receive this written report I will include them

141
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
That is way too long of a disclaimer 2 basically say

142
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
Not nothing that you're about to see

143
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
Here is probably true at all and also please.

144
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,991
There's something in this

145
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
Come after we have some pedophile accusation

146
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
So this

147
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,671
Fake disclaimer plays I like that was

148
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,511
Too long and then guess what there's another water cycle

149
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:41,215
Long time ago in a galaxy far far away as well be because it just gives Mark backstory

150
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,591
We have a lot of new listeners who come along and a lot of them may not have heard our back episodes

151
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
Covering a Kerry Cassidy

152
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
Visits down to

153
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,015
Prism to interview a space weirdo

154
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
So I guess everyone's benefits

155
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Speed up speed on the story a little bit completely non skeptical

156
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,095
Scary prison

157
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
For over 30 years Captain Mark Richards has been and still is a prisoner of the war between

158
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
Races that have dominated Earth

159
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
For centuries

160
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,895
He's an honorable officer in the Navy who because of his Rebellion against

161
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
The Draco and Reptoid

162
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
In parentheses the luciferian

163
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
Of course he's considered a threat to their operation

164
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
Naturally he was praying for a murdered use accused of having masterminded while he was on a mission off-planet in service

165
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
Humanity

166
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
He was Captain of a Starship Enterprise type vessel

167
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
Fighting the war against aliens been told to take over planet Earth I am the only journalist who is interviewed him a

168
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Person while he's been in prison

169
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,359
Point of order the Starship Enterprise was not a warship

170
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Sleeping Beauty

171
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
They weren't out there to do battle

172
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
Google

173
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
Draco right and not engage with

174
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Weird level

175
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
So

176
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
I was already exhaust

177
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
By the time I got through all that

178
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
And that's all before we eat

179
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Get to this point

180
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Of all of our

181
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:29,247
Hi I'm Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot I'm here to discuss my latest interview

182
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
Captain Mark Richards of the secret space program

183
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
Force space command as some

184
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
People call it

185
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Hi

186
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Find Thurston

187
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Kind of like

188
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
It sounds like she's reporting from a bunker somewhere

189
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,703
I don't know what it is maybe she was recording from a backup

190
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Computer or something like that

191
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
Or she dropped her computer in the tub

192
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
Matter it's not forthcoming audio changes a little bit maybe 6

193
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
Equips to sound better and then it sound like s*** again that's not your headphones

194
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Out there

195
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Against a little bit more backstory

196
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
It's her to carry talking about how she

197
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
She's been talking to Mark forever

198
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Issei Secret

199
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
That other people

200
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,823
Mentioned

201
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Because it's not true

202
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,455
No that's correct

203
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
I am an investigative journalist documentary filmmaker and I have been visiting Mark 4

204
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Around five years

205
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Approximately once every 6 months

206
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,279
And doing an in-depth interview with him

207
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
About the secret space program

208
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
And because he is in prison

209
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,983
This gives him the ability

210
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
And leeway

211
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,151
To discuss what is an essence of way Above Top Secret

212
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,759
And I believe the government allows him to talk simply because

213
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
They believe he is discrediting

214
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
By the fact that he is been

215
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
In prison for a murder he did not commit

216
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,095
Discredited

217
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
This is just good getting up to

218
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
She's going to spend about these aliens

219
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Mark's nonsense

220
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
That is why

221
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
The government gave him

222
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Clearance to do it

223
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Because he's in prison

224
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
They know that everyone

225
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
The crazy dude in prison

226
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,647
That doesn't that doesn't sound

227
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Speaking when the government

228
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Record

229
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Even if they are in prison

230
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Telling the truth

231
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
They go

232
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
Let's call it Chelsea Manning all over

233
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
They they go hard

234
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Bright bright

235
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Even if they are in

236
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
Is it a little bit unlike all the rest and nausea

237
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Is a terrible audio quality

238
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
It's different

239
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
In that for whatever reason

240
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Carrie decides to get into the

241
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Details of why mark

242
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Is in prison on this episode

243
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
Yeah

244
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:21,279
Yarn that reinforces her narrative that he was off-planet

245
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,887
Rodeo just been able to listen and laugh

246
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,471
Cut the nonsense about like Raptor aliens killing people for chocolate make

247
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Cameos in Jurassic World

248
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
Fighter leadership

249
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,639
All that fun

250
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,527
That is you can watch Jurassic world they're laughing at you after

251
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Not all of them.

252
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Episode is very

253
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
Because in this episode

254
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Repeating lies about

255
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Something that actually

256
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
We happened in the real world

257
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
And as such I can research that

258
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
That's why we got the disclaimer

259
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,471
No that she gives a disclaimer for we'll get to what

260
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
The fact that I can look into these

261
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
It's not good news

262
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
The story that he was off-planet

263
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
I just couldn't have masterminded a murder

264
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Totally masterminded a burger

265
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
104

266
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,391
What credit card receipts from around the day just to prove that he was not

267
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Play they could fake

268
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
So in this next clip

269
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
Some of the details in the particulars

270
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Is about

271
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
The murder

272
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
Mark Richards 100% orcas

273
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Good because

274
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Get some really bad

275
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
Max wrong

276
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Just like just

277
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Provable facts

278
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Wrong

279
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,111
He is said to be the Mastermind of

280
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
A show called Murder

281
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,255
Of an individual called Richard Baldwin

282
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,351
That murder was committed by two young

283
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
Boys at the time

284
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
Of the age of 18

285
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
And Richard Baldwin has been

286
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Documented to be a pedophile

287
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
Might be why there's a disclaimer

288
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Because there is documentation

289
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,599
No evidence

290
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
You can

291
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
Say those things about him if you have that evidence

292
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,559
Short but I can see no evidence of it other than it just being assertive

293
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
And that's not good

294
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Pretty much

295
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Kind of

296
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,799
The factual problem is that Crossing Hoover

297
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Andrew

298
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
Whose last name

299
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
Crime

300
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
If she doesn't even know that big difference

301
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
The difference between

302
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
18 + 18

303
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,231
Terms of legal system for federal offenses

304
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
Answer the package

305
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
She's f****** up

306
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Is not good

307
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
Well I do that

308
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
He's not sucking it up so much

309
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Repeating verbatim

310
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
What

311
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Does it make it look like

312
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Influencing minors

313
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
To do stop

314
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
If instead he's just in

315
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Influencing

316
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Kolin all day

317
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Right

318
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Yeah it's

319
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
It's a mess

320
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
His

321
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,935
No she doesn't know the ages of the murderer and

322
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:46,335
The guy who went and burgled Richards

323
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
There is a slight overlap with

324
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
Episode

325
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
The dollop the Pendragon

326
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
But

327
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Go into all of

328
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
The angles of

329
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Necessarily so

330
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
Does it does a lot of stuff that wasn't

331
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
It won't be over

332
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,631
Carrie starts talking about how this is

333
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
Really an attack on marks

334
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
It's been going on

335
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,871
This particular interview is concerned with a V case

336
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
And some of the things that Mark

337
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,271
Wanted to bring forward about the cut case that are not out there

338
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,135
There's been some interest in the public and in various sectors

339
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
And with us

340
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
Pacific group that is attempting to discredit

341
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:40,095
Both Joanne Richardson Mark Richards as well as myself

342
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
At this point I really thought you was talking about

343
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,671
The mark Richards case and so we are

344
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,767
Making an added effort here to reach the public with the

345
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Accurate information

346
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Do that job

347
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,215
Talk about a little bit later and he is

348
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Going to release

349
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
About

350
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
The murder

351
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
Baldwin murder

352
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
The trailer for it that I watch

353
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Awesome because he talks to people across

354
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
The spectrum of light

355
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Detox to Mark Richards

356
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,743
Wife from the time but back when he lets the murder happened

357
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,071
Two Crossing Hoover the guy who actually did the murder

358
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
He talks to people who Newmarket

359
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
College

360
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,471
Toxic family members of the victim of Baldwin

361
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
To someone

362
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,591
At least from the trailer people are all

363
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
Featured in the trailer

364
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
Someone else

365
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Penpal of marks

366
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
In prison

367
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
Obscured

368
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
For privacy

369
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
But you talked about how to use a total fraud in like

370
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
Brutally

371
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
Here's the thing

372
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Patriot

373
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
So it's an entire like

374
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,167
The trailer is an entire string of evil being like

375
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,471
Mark Mark

376
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
His behavior change

377
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
Right after the murder

378
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
Completely different

379
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
Yeah I mean Mark told me that is finished

380
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
The job he was standing right next

381
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Text me when I did it

382
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,319
Connecticut's to carry into sitting there next to be like

383
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
No

384
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
He is innocent

385
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
He's working

386
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,207
In with the Raptors

387
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
Oh you know

388
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
I like it stalking about Martha the Joann

389
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
And her is like

390
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
The truth has a way of discrediting you

391
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:05,759
I love that I cannot wait for it to come out

392
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
Making a murderer

393
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,695
Because it didn't have Kerry insisted that the government was run by

394
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
I would be very interested

395
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
To get her in more Conte

396
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
I'm not going to do

397
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
With you on that

398
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
Are you forgotten that guy's name but I have it in my notes

399
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
You're in a little bit

400
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
Carrie talks about how like she knows that marker

401
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Legit

402
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
She doesn't know

403
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Cuz she has a sir

404
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Set of skills

405
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Sono

406
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
I can also testify to the fact that

407
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
As an investigative journalist specializing in Above Top Secret information from whistleblowers

408
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,655
That I believe I have a man excellent judge of character

409
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
Cannabis case I can

410
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Say that

411
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Without any

412
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Hesitation

413
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Let Mike Richards

414
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,895
Is absolutely puhi

415
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Claims to be

416
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,015
Scott two pictures of Eddie page

417
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
Her to be but like

418
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
She is a terrible judge of people's character she has no idea

419
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
Hard to find a statement

420
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
That wrong

421
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
Edit entire statement is

422
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Walt

423
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
Incorrect

424
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
Spiritually factually

425
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,152
Content-wise

426
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
Call trash

427
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,624
I feel like we're going to do that a lot

428
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:52,768
Get to the murder just yet

429
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
Just factual detail

430
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
But what's interesting is

431
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
Mark has an

432
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
It turns out that we didn't know about okay

433
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
Mark Richards

434
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
He never did have an idea

435
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
Who Mark Richards is because you've been dead

436
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
41

437
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,880
There are some key takeaways from this interview

438
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,952
First of all Marcus father's archenemy

439
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
According to mark

440
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,048
Bring up James Jesus Angleton

441
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,120
And this is also the case for Kennedy

442
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:35,776
According to Mark Angleton was instrumental in the death of John F Kennedy framing of Captain Mark rich

443
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,736
Who killed JFK

444
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Who is this guy

445
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,088
Head of counterintelligence for the CIA until nineteen

446
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,672
35

447
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
Market

448
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
It was

449
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
I don't know

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
14

451
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
Mark was 29 in 1982 he committed that murder it's so like 75

452
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:10,336
Would have been 7 years earlier

453
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
CIA

454
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
First time

455
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,528
Engage with his father's nemesis

456
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,600
This is a multi-generational point

457
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,928
I imagine that

458
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,048
Yeah I'm actually two of his daughters came under the sway of a guru

459
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
It's such a such a side issue that I didn't look into it but others Wikipedia

460
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,688
Two of his daughters converted to Alex following us Wommack

461
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
School

462
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:53,344
I like

463
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,952
Stuff that I care about in

464
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
Mark's store

465
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
The idea that

466
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,816
He was set up by the CIA

467
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Instrumental in Killing Kennedy

468
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
It's too much

469
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,800
It's honestly too much it doesn't matter more frustrated

470
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
Because I don't know where the Dutchman is

471
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
All of this

472
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
The Dutchman has been alive

473
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
Documents is Dad okay

474
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,720
I apologize

475
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
What is the document

476
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
The Dutchman

477
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,192
We have his real name now because it does come up

478
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
Some of the

479
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:47,872
News articles about his son murder

480
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,224
Wright was like a major

481
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
In the services

482
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
But he was actually a military

483
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,832
And all that stuff but all the rest

484
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Ludacris

485
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
Go back stories

486
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,744
Play horseshit but the reason that I don't care about this

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Is like

488
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
I don't want to spend

489
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
The next

490
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
I don't know

491
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,216
Days of my life trying to figure out if his Angleton killed Kennedy

492
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:20,896
I don't want to do the work has been put in already

493
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
Further I don't really care to do like

494
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
Some sort of a thing where like I'm

495
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Defending the CIA

496
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
Or anything like that

497
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
The CIA in

498
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
The 70s

499
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,744
I don't

500
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,144
He's just trying to fix his wagon to that team of anti CIA

501
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,776
Read a book about the JFK assassination with like

502
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Angleton

503
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
Who killed Kennedy is responsible for Mark being set up in

504
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Supernatural

505
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
Instead of orchestrating murder

506
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
Tom and

507
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Really f****** up a cover-up

508
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Takeaways

509
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
The second takeaway major take away from this interview is that there are six alien Drive

510
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
Play eyes

511
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,704
Currently messing with Earth and

512
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,520
They do not have our best interest in mind

513
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
She doesn't elaborate on this

514
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
What's the weather

515
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
Messing with

516
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
Malicious they're just

517
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Walking around

518
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Aliens developed

519
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
AI with a sense of humor

520
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
The Swedish or something

521
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Yeah I don't know I really wish I knew more about what you was talking about but it's not elaborated on

522
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,384
That that just thrown out there and his backup

523
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,736
AI is alien in nature I guess

524
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Someone were competing

525
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,392
I don't know don't ask me

526
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,208
Don't you dare f****** aspirin

527
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
TI-86

528
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Them are somehow like

529
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
Like summer on

530
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,216
I'm somewhere on a but they're all messing with us.

531
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
Irrelevant

532
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
6 a.m.

533
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,920
No names Bill details

534
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,760
Yeah so the next

535
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Listed

536
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Doesn't take away but I think it's

537
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
Because I took a plotys class and I'm going back to

538
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
The gym

539
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
Is that getting help

540
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,048
Update on Prison life and marks hell

541
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
His health has markedly improved

542
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Isn't training for a new job

543
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
He's headed the optical lab that's

544
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,616
Surprise all eyewear for Medicaid it is a highly technical job supervising around 100

545
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Men

546
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,736
Well as a number of robots that operate the machinery

547
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296
She is also being trained on computers

548
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,880
The last time he was around computers on a job

549
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,976
In prison was where they were using very old software he says

550
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:21,632
There's also teaching a screenwriting class

551
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Screenplay

552
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
That he believes

553
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
Might become the basis for a TV series not unlike Breaking Bad or Orange Is the New

554
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
Block

555
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
Okay

556
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:38,528
Now that's a good that's a good fit

557
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,184
Clearly been able to pull a yarn here

558
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,328
Yeah I think that maybe you need some editors Workshop setting

559
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
To get some of these potholes out of there

560
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,728
Melbourne Melbourne

561
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,288
Yeah

562
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Creative

563
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
South going

564
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Screenplay that class has

565
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,760
Beaded screenplays

566
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
I beg of March

567
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,000
Unh

568
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
Sacrifice for the greater good

569
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
John computers which is good that's nice

570
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
So we move on it is next clip Carrie gets in

571
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
The murder

572
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
Discuss this more in-depth than wherever lies are

573
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Is she

574
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
Way off base

575
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
In terms of

576
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Reality

577
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Poulan

578
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
I read a lot of stuff

579
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Good for him for bringing into

580
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,256
Non-medical biting all of

581
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
I would I don't think they put in

582
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,728
In charge of anybody I feel like

583
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,824
Right as we find out about a mismatched

584
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
The murder and the trial

585
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,736
Mark states that he doesn't really know what happened because he wasn't there

586
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
And the TA was given

587
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
Most or all of his info

588
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
From this mysterious character

589
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
First name is Andrew Campbell

590
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
Supposedly at the scene of the crime

591
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
Took part in the murder but was never charged

592
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,936
So scary beginning to try and wade into the water is

593
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Discussing hell Marcus

594
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
The murder that either

595
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
M4

596
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
She does not get off to

597
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Strong start

598
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,896
The first problem is that Mark absolutely was there the night

599
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
Forensic evidence indicates that he was

600
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,064
Repeatedly whenever the police revealed new details

601
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Contradicted his story

602
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
He would just say you'd have one story and then they bring up a detail that they knew maybe like

603
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:04,192
I was trying to do I didn't want to admit that I had done this course

604
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
I would never change

605
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
What's forensic evidence

606
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,104
And every sworn statement except

607
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,152
Is the confession of Crossing Hoover

608
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,968
The seventeen-year-old employee of marks

609
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Directing company

610
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
Who physically killed Richard bald

611
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,344
In order to explain just how dumb Carey sounds

612
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
MetLife

613
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
I need to probably give you a little refresher course

614
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
On the actual murder

615
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
On July 6th

616
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,072
Mark Richardson Crossing Hoover Lord Richard Baldwin

617
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
Good friend of Mark

618
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
Do a garage under the pretense

619
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Classic cars

620
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Baldwin age 30

621
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
6 vintage car restoration

622
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
Shop called the classic

623
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
The car

624
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,920
Too cool really rare cars that it was working on in the shop

625
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Nazi

626
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,736
He's crazy as it might initially

627
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,064
Martin Crossing

628
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Kill and Rob Baldwin

629
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
Ultimately plan to sell all his cars

630
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
Machinery to fun

631
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
But I plan to take over Marin County

632
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:03,584
I'm intentionally going to ignore that aspect of this

633
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,632
Create a kingdom for himself called Pendragon

634
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Specific

635
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
Because Carrie is talking about the court

636
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
And the court largely ignored marks

637
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
Imperial aspiration

638
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
Mostly because it was completely unnecessary to

639
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
To prove his guilt

640
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
They think they were very specific about

641
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
This isn't really relevant

642
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
This is the problem

643
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
Do not want

644
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
So much more work

645
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
Berkshire charge

646
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Right

647
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
You already got him on murder

648
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Fun

649
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,168
So the garage Mark cross in the sky

650
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
At which point Crossing hit Baldwin multiple times

651
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,568
Physical

652
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,128
Murdered

653
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,664
Call burnout

654
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,504
Baldwin in the Torso but his weapon broke off

655
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,808
According to a recent interview Crossing game

656
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,136
Mark the driver and told him to finish

657
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
The job

658
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,280
Mark isn't the goofy eccentric space weirdo he's the sort of cold-blooded monster who can orchestrate

659
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Tom we watch someone

660
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,632
He presented as a friend be brutally murder

661
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
Richard Baldwin was in Mark's wedding

662
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Wow

663
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
They were friends

664
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,360
And he was there crossing Hoover a screwdriver

665
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
And told him to finish and murdering

666
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
Razee yeah

667
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
That is psychopath level ship

668
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,928
The wedding party

669
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:37,536
Three years prior

670
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Jesus

671
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,632
So now Mike was charged with first-degree murder and two counts of burglary

672
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,752
Is where are the other seventeen-year-old Andrew

673
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Comes in

674
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Prior to the murder Marquette

675
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,384
Baldwin's house to take an inventory of things

676
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
Andrew's involvement in

677
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,112
The story that Carrie is telling is literally only supported by marks word

678
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
Is very unreliable

679
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,184
I thought

680
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
Mark was a total liar and a douche from

681
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
The first time we talked about him

682
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
But in preparation for this episode

683
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,656
Including a 131-page interview with a

684
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,472
Least he gave right after he was arrested

685
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,288
And I've got to say that knowing what I know now

686
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
It's even more embarrassing

687
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
The Carrie believe the word that

688
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Secret space

689
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Didn't mention

690
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
He's trying to lie

691
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
So hard in that interview

692
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
It's so embarrassing when you read over it

693
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
Is the police or just being like

694
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Hey man

695
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,000
We know what happened

696
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Work

697
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
We're giving you a ticket

698
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:50,240
Inside of the murder and he wasn't

699
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
He was at Baldwin's house

700
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Baja getting the burglary started

701
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
Right right

702
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Two charges of burglary cuz they burgled

703
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
House and burgled

704
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
The garage

705
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
So did that

706
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
But they're big

707
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Okay

708
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
So

709
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
These are these

710
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Interviews

711
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
AR

712
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
So

713
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Two homicide

714
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,352
One from the Sheriff's Office

715
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
In one from San Rafael

716
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
The cops are trying to get

717
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
Understand that they've completely solved

718
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
The case even before entering the room

719
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,224
They keep trying to stretch to him but they're only talking to him because they want to give him a chance to do the right thing

720
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,296
And he never does there's 100

721
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
31 page interview of decline

722
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
Walking in Sanford

723
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,952
We know what hap

724
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
We are not implying that they know what happened and then like 30 pages

725
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
So they're like

726
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
I don't believe

727
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
So they started off with the like

728
00:35:53,984 --> 00:36:00,128
We're playing we're playing the interviews interrogation game

729
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,712
Later on there just like to

730
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
F*** off we know what happened stop it.

731
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,184
We don't even want to be here anymore

732
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,304
Nothing wasn't involved

733
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,376
Pocopson Marco back and forth no one's really enjoying

734
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,448
Themselves

735
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Who says quote

736
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,776
I don't believe what you're saying

737
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,848
I just feel that I'm wasting my time and if you and I can't

738
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
Candid with one another

739
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,200
I think you ought to at least allow me the opportunity to go back to my office

740
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Go to work

741
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,112
Yeah

742
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:48,512
There are relatively welcome

743
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,864
Why is it they know where lies

744
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
So

745
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
They said quotes

746
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:05,408
In addition to what rich is saying I have to tend to agree very strongly with what she said

747
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,272
These guys are

748
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,880
I would like to pop in and say I also think you're an idiot and I

749
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,464
Good cop bad cop

750
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,792
Sick of the b******* cop equally

751
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,376
It's awesome

752
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
So

753
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:32,288
And they make it clear to him

754
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
He isn't going to get another chance

755
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
His opportunity work with

756
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
Will be gone if they leave that room

757
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
The Marquis

758
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
Keep begging them not to

759
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
And each time the cops

760
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,344
I reach their point of annoyance they say they're going to

761
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
And magically mark

762
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
Story starts

763
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
To change

764
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
Yeah cuz he's trying to

765
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
You keep saying

766
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
Stuff like

767
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
I know that you're going to

768
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Believe and I

769
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
I don't have enough

770
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,520
That I'm I'm innocent in all this there like we don't want you to tell the truth

771
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,176
They keep saying stuff to him like you understand that there's literally nothing you can say to us that will get you out of this

772
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
Vicky place

773
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Yeah I understand

774
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
Like you know you're more thing though

775
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,856
You know there's not a magic

776
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:23,232
Word you can say that will

777
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
Does work

778
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
I do with the judge right

779
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,936
1 pointer asking bark about what rumors

780
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
You've heard on the street

781
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Read about the murder

782
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
Because he starts

783
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Does angle look like

784
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
I didn't I didn't I don't know any

785
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
I've heard any

786
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,152
But I've been threatened

787
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
He starts to have this like

788
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,016
S*** I better start pretending that I was lying about

789
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,576
Something earlier

790
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
He starts trying to throw cross

791
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
Open Hoover under the bus

792
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Yes he's called

793
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Colloquial

794
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
I couldn't have done it I was

795
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,120
I didn't tell you cuz I was sleeping

796
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
He doesn't do that

797
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Implying

798
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
He's heard the Crossing

799
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,640
And they want to know

800
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Pacifically about the rumors

801
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
But he's heard on the street about the murder

802
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,272
He relates that he heard that crossy had committed the murder

803
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,576
And was telling people that Mark was involved

804
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
And planned it

805
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
The story that's going around the street

806
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Detective

807
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
Who'd you hear that from

808
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
Mark

809
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,544
I'm not wait a minute I'm trying to think so you know I'm sure you already know and I'm not trying to lie okay. Texas

810
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,152
Detective we sure do it it's not that hard

811
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
They all work for you mark

812
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
Okay

813
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
Yeah I know

814
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,320
There's so many points you are

815
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
Busted

816
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
I need you to know that as soon as possible

817
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,488
Something that a liar

818
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
Yep

819
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Texas broad my favorite moment

820
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
The entire interview

821
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Just drop it on it

822
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Michael's like that

823
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:14,080
Mark quote I'm trying okay I appreciate your bunch of crock

824
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,480
Bedtime you pick that you caught me in two or three or a dozen lies or whatever but I want you to Emma.

825
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,088
Detective we have Mark all right

826
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
Gadget Detective

827
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
We have

828
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,952
And we still got you

829
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
Later they try

830
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Explain the problem

831
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Quotes

832
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
This is Detective

833
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Mark

834
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
The problem is you

835
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
F***** up too many times

836
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
And you associated with fools

837
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
Very immature.

838
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
Do that Markiplier

839
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,296
There is an acceptance of his own culpability but yeah

840
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:01,440
Entire 131 pages of this interview

841
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
YouTube

842
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
You know that we know things

843
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,352
And you know that we know that you know things

844
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
They're not

845
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:14,752
F****** with a trying to coerce a confession or anything they're just like

846
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,568
They are you are really you're on my last nerve

847
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,152
What is that is not what they say about Psychopaths like this

848
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Is that it

849
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
It doesn't matter they they think they're so much

850
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Smarter than you

851
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,880
Whatever it is you're saying that fine but not so much smarter than you

852
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
I can find a way through this

853
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Yeah yeah yeah

854
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
So that interview

855
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
Is really it was really fast

856
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
Throughout the entire time that we've been covering Markin

857
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,376
Carrie's interviews we never heard his word

858
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,168
Really only hurt Aries and

859
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
Interpretation of them instead

860
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
See the flick talker and all this stuff

861
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,895
Based on this interview with that

862
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Walk away from

863
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Thinking like

864
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
He's not that he's not a master manipulator

865
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
The people who fall for him are just

866
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,135
Stupidest s*** well he has had almost 40 years to really get the story right

867
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
And I still haven't

868
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
So

869
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,815
She talks about in the sex Club carry talks about

870
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,911
Gentleman seventeen-year-old

871
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,239
Was at the Baldwins house while the murder was going on

872
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
Interesting info

873
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
The theory about

874
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,383
Andrew

875
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,175
An assumed name

876
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,735
Joanne Richards marks wife

877
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,831
I tracked him down and he lives somewhere in central California

878
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,623
That's pretty f*****-up

879
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Here's what I would say

880
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
Andrew isn't an assumed name

881
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
That wasn't

882
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,839
F****** years old and Mark Richards lured him into a murder

883
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:51,007
The idea was operating under an assumed name is like a junior in high school on the off-chance that he had the opportunity to help

884
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,335
Set up a notable space captain

885
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Wheatley f******

886
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:01,759
What's not absurd is the idea that in the thirty or so years since the murder

887
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Because of people like

888
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,087
Like Carrie and Joanne Richard

889
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
I don't think the Carey

890
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,927
I don't think the Carrie should be using

891
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Anders Holm

892
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,047
He was a miner who wasn't charged with a crime

893
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
I believe his privates

894
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
His name does appear in legal filings

895
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,495
And in new stories from back then

896
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
Secret

897
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:28,383
Are yours and marks unsuccessful appeal that was filed on April

898
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
2819

899
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
888

900
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
But according to journalistic app

901
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,759
I think it's inappropriate to identify him

902
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,319
So I'm going to have bleeped out all the time

903
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Is full name

904
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Just in case

905
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,791
Like that kind of active Renegade

906
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,863
This is targeted harassment of a private citizen

907
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Almost certainly just wants

908
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
To live their life

909
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,215
And probably deeply regrets

910
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
Their involvement in this

911
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,799
Modern 30 years prior

912
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,919
Cooperated with the state after the fact

913
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
After realizing

914
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
So

915
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
We mentioned earlier that

916
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Mark wanted

917
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,351
How is that a misunderstanding cuz Mark was writing a book called Imperial Marin

918
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
Okay right

919
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,703
And so Carrie gets the plan wasn't planning this part of the

920
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Plot of his

921
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
His novel

922
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
I have to clear motives

923
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,663
That where I stated

924
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,991
In the trial or during the the length of the trial

925
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
And I'm

926
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,135
I do want to interject that motive one is based on the science fiction book

927
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
Imperial Moran

928
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:50,047
And I will put the book cover here and be quoting from the back of the book

929
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:56,959
Mark was riding which took place in the future where as The Story Goes Marin County has become a play

930
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
Place

931
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,287
Environmentally sound

932
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,871
And an absolutely Democratic and free Society

933
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,991
It concerns a planet-wide society led by Hero

934
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,391
Run

935
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Gyro King

936
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,975
What's the term limit on here okay

937
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,071
It's a lifetime

938
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
Generational

939
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
We were focused on creating a better future

940
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,799
This novel actually series of seven books

941
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:39,199
I was misrepresented in the courtroom and depress as a takeover of Marin County

942
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
It's very simple.

943
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
Soaked

944
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
For Mark's garage

945
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
Court was

946
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,279
Play November Rain County

947
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
Novel

948
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,727
I should give you full disclosure here I tried to buy a copy of Imperial Marin for the sepa

949
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:08,127
Because I'm positive that it's really fun to discuss

950
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Play there is

951
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,967
Amazon but there are no copies

952
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Available

953
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
That does not surprise

954
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,599
As far as I can tell the only place you can buy a copy of from Joanne Richards

955
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,903
And there's no way I'm giving her a goddamn time

956
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
Completely stupid

957
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
The chord specifically decided not to

958
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,399
To even argue that Mark was trying to take over Marin County or charge him with a crime for that because

959
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
Like I said earlier

960
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
They didn't mean to

961
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
They haven't

962
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,103
Problem

963
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
Reading for Mark Sons

964
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Successful appeal for 90

965
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
88 where you tried to argue

966
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,295
Just against it because he was planning to take over the county they lived in

967
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Which

968
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,183
Now that kind of

969
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
Imagine that

970
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
Charge you with that

971
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Target Bangor

972
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,287
Would require a death

973
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,663
Strange Planet yet

974
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:17,759
I think really complicate matters

975
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,575
Don't want a brooch

976
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
Recipe

977
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,719
Quote the jury was instructed to consider the Pendragon evidence

978
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
Solely to the extent that it

979
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Who established the

980
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,655
And Andrew and Crossing Hoover on the other

981
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,775
You are not called upon to decide whether any aspect of the Pendragon activity was illegal

982
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,567
Nor should you assume that it was

983
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
The defendant is not acute

984
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
Plotting to overthrow Marin County

985
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:50,527
Foot of crimes the crimes of murder and burglary

986
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,671
And and don't assume that taking over Marin County

987
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
Is a crime

988
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,303
You don't know that

989
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
For the preservation of absolute

990
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
Unfairly biased

991
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:13,311
Most likely in Marin County specifically that is like

992
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
Turns out it's not a crime to overthrow Marion County it's just like one of those old like you can't kiss a horse

993
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,271
The horse on Tuesday

994
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
So the prosecution was pretty careful. The whole Pendragon

995
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
Because they knew it was messy

996
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
To put it simply

997
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
They didn't

998
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
The overthrowing Marine part 2

999
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
Establish

1000
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,471
Emmett Crawford

1001
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,151
Establish a motive in court for the murder

1002
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
That's a straw man argument

1003
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
Mark uses

1004
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
Pretend he was Railroad

1005
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
And Carries just repeating

1006
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
Haven't done no actual research

1007
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,135
I heard a few vague

1008
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
Parallels with Alex's

1009
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Currently

1010
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Situation

1011
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Like that

1012
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
You getting sued

1013
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
Freeze coverage

1014
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,071
In his deposition

1015
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,887
It's pretty clearly established that in early 2013

1016
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,959
Has horrible reporting on things will

1017
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
Which he never investigated

1018
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Himself before 4

1019
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
Similarly

1020
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,383
Here is just taking the word of a lunatic

1021
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
As the gospel

1022
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Without fact-checking

1023
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
Single bit of it

1024
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,783
The game carries playing are way lower

1025
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,343
But it deserves mention how these people operate

1026
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Free watched

1027
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
Just take whatever these crazy people saying

1028
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
410

1029
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Yeah

1030
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Another intern

1031
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
In parallel with Infowars

1032
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
Hi there World pops

1033
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Spell the pill

1034
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
The court did find it some of the reference

1035
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,471
Does the Pendragon

1036
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,775
And I in the initial trial

1037
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,567
Scope of what they were there for

1038
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
But didn't count

1039
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,639
Constitute any sort of miscarriage of Justice

1040
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
And I didn't really affect the

1041
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
The outcome of the case

1042
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
Facebook quote

1043
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
We agree with the Appellate

1044
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,087
Pendragon

1045
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
Beyond the

1046
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Purpose for which it was admitted

1047
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,463
Such as the reference

1048
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,023
About excluded blacks of the new form of government

1049
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Alright

1050
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,631
That's right barkskins be a white nationalist

1051
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,447
It should come as no surprise

1052
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
Anybody

1053
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Nope

1054
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
Is he barks a little bit of a racist

1055
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
It is interview with

1056
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,895
He describes the salesman for Montgomery Ward

1057
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
Video camera is quote

1058
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,015
Tall guy brown hair you might have had some Mexican blood in her

1059
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
There's no

1060
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
To throw that in there

1061
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
To the rule

1062
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,263
In terms of Project Camelot

1063
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
There's a lot of overlap

1064
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:59,199
Use overthrow of Marin or whatever

1065
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:04,575
Carrie could be arguing about this Imperial Marin use that as a motive

1066
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
In court at all that is

1067
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
False argument

1068
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Gary's making

1069
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
There's a second

1070
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
Motive

1071
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,023
The carry

1072
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
She said there was too I was just the first one

1073
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
Second one

1074
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,655
Nope they're unreliable

1075
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
Second one though is

1076
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
Variac

1077
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,591
And the second motive attributed to mark

1078
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:30,175
Is a motive in which they claim Mark needed the money

1079
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,759
VTA claimed based on the testimony from Andrew

1080
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:39,391
Let Matt Mark masterminded the murder for the sum of $2,000

1081
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:43,487
This is apparently substantiated based on a paper

1082
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,327
The $2,000 number is just the amount of cash

1083
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,399
Emma's house

1084
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
The car is like

1085
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
The plot itself

1086
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,359
Marin County

1087
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
Is that

1088
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
He was Baldwin was

1089
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,343
Is that he was known for having large amounts of

1090
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Garage

1091
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
Large

1092
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
Egyptian cats

1093
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
Yeah

1094
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,447
That marks attorney Shapiro and we'll talk more about him later

1095
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,031
I got Mark to sign after he was jailed and

1096
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
When he actually had no

1097
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,103
Visible means

1098
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Support

1099
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,455
So this just really quick what she's trying to say because she spells it out

1100
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,735
The later part but

1101
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
It's not worth listen

1102
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
Twice

1103
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,087
Would you starting to make the argument that marks lawyer

1104
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
Shapiro

1105
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Edmark sign

1106
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Piece of paper

1107
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
What he got into court

1108
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
Said that he was

1109
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,303
Carrie is making the argument

1110
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,631
Is he was once upon

1111
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
But he wasn't before you went into prison

1112
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
He was flush

1113
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,983
Of course

1114
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,263
So that's nonsense

1115
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,943
But it was simply untrue prior to the death of Baldwin

1116
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
In fact

1117
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,783
Mark states that marks wife at the time Karen

1118
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:15,647
During the year before the murder had spent over half a million dollars on

1119
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
Furniture alarm

1120
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,951
You'll notice that

1121
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
She said Mark

1122
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
Mark's ex-wife

1123
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,303
But that much money on furniture

1124
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,119
Established

1125
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,399
Other than marks

1126
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,191
And it absolutely

1127
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:39,455
Mark states he was making far more money than was possible through his job as a contractor

1128
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:44,063
I thought it was his ex-wife Karen who reportedly has problem with

1129
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,623
Alcohol at this time

1130
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,207
Does not seem to recall or has never been questioned

1131
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,279
On how often Mark was absent from home

1132
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,815
During their marriage

1133
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:59,423
I would go with all the reality marks contracting business was a cover

1134
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,751
Money earned fighting in the secret space command

1135
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
Wow that sure

1136
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:16,063
The murder Mark was telling cross in Hoover and Andrew that Richard Baldwin owed him

1137
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
A lot of money

1138
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,879
He was getting sick and tired of Baldwin.

1139
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Hang up

1140
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:23,487
Mark Antony to use that narrative post-arrest interview with

1141
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
Claiming that he done some home improvement work for Baldwin

1142
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,583
What you was owed

1143
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
4

1144
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
Hi-Time money-wise

1145
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,471
Cuz he wasn't getting the money that he needed from

1146
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,055
But you would present

1147
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,103
I killed him I couldn't get the money back

1148
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,503
From him that I needed

1149
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,295
You can ask that to me alive

1150
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,367
But he's not to me that unless you're stealing all of his

1151
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,463
So it is trial has shown that in fact Marcotte Baldwin a large sum

1152
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
Surprise

1153
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,535
Creditors

1154
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,559
For Mark's Contracting

1155
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
Baldwin it floated marks

1156
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,167
Credit is unable to pay him back

1157
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
Is pretty firmly established

1158
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
Part of the motive for the murder which is what I mean actual motive for the murder

1159
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,247
He got hit with a much harder sentence

1160
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
Is because

1161
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Pizza

1162
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Special

1163
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
A first-degree murder

1164
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
With that being

1165
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,183
The intention of Financial and Rich

1166
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:28,767
Yeah it was a qualification for that is something along the lines of like

1167
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
You're trying to get money

1168
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,143
Getting that money it's killing

1169
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:40,543
And because you're trying to get money and you accidentally killed somebody

1170
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,615
Incidentally kill along the way

1171
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
Yeah yeah there's a difference between

1172
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
And this is much worse

1173
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,759
Mark's contracting business was not afraid

1174
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
From him fighting

1175
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
Secret space

1176
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,111
Because if it were

1177
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,135
Set up like a front

1178
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:00,767
When a secret government entity creates a cut out front business they make sure it looks like a real business

1179
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,303
It's kind of important for the

1180
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
To actually work

1181
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,863
Cuz you don't want to raise this

1182
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
How much to redo your password

1183
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,727
36 of the interview Mark did with the detective

1184
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
Detective

1185
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,567
What's the name of your company

1186
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,335
Mark

1187
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,359
I don't really have one

1188
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,575
We just work part-time doing anything we can Detective

1189
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,855
So you're not in the Yellow Pages

1190
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,695
No no I'm much too small for that

1191
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,815
Secret space program front the very least they would have done it come up with

1192
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:38,143
The goddamn name for their front business

1193
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:44,543
Captain Barker Richard secret space program guy no self-respecting secret space program is going to be like all right look

1194
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,335
We got to pay for this superhero Space Camp

1195
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,431
Do we need a business to final payment through

1196
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:56,063
How about we haven't brought a completely unregistered odd jobs business where you employees minors

1197
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,599
Should we name the companies

1198
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,511
Bulshit

1199
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:10,143
The very idea of a secret space program operating this way it's Celtic

1200
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,727
It is fixed perfect

1201
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,287
Because

1202
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,591
What would you name a business that has to be

1203
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,199
Do we have any evidence

1204
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Anyone

1205
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:31,135
Based on his testimony he fixed the fence but also Hoover might have knocked over that time

1206
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,511
A little complicated

1207
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:42,399
Does not everything out 130 pages

1208
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,959
Even the slightest oddjob to be simple

1209
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:49,823
Of course the very odd most likely

1210
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,199
So in that interview with police Mark even admit

1211
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
Attempt had nothing to do with

1212
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,807
The murder that was probably dead

1213
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:04,671
He knew he was dead at that point

1214
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
I had a good reason.

1215
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,231
I think he was probably dead

1216
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,791
Even in that mindset

1217
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Which of the fake mines

1218
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,631
But these presenting it as I was his mindset

1219
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,679
He went through Baldwin's house.

1220
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,959
To try and find

1221
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
He was pretending Baldwin owed him

1222
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,871
At that point

1223
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:29,503
Basically just confessed to grave-robbing

1224
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:34,111
He was like

1225
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,647
I mean it wasn't great

1226
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:40,255
What was the issue

1227
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,559
Started to talk about various

1228
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Details

1229
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,679
That Mark knows.

1230
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,751
Maybe bluffing

1231
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,591
It looks like that I mean look I went in

1232
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,407
I don't want to tell you this cuz I know it's f***** up I went in

1233
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,967
Whose house after I figured he was already dead

1234
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,503
And I took that but it was just because

1235
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Money I need to make

1236
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
My money

1237
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
And then

1238
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,743
Sounding story

1239
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:16,095
131

1240
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
Police interview

1241
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,423
You get a real good sense of what he's doing to carry

1242
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
Whenever she comes in

1243
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
Yeah cuz she'll bring up something about Raptors

1244
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:32,223
To accommodate whatever

1245
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
Terry whenever

1246
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
She talks about in his

1247
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:41,695
He validates so many things that I already know from my research the greatest whistleblower of all time

1248
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,719
Or

1249
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,767
To the light

1250
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,071
He is a veteran

1251
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,351
Sociopathic liar

1252
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,191
Robert

1253
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:58,847
Mark also admitted that he use Baldwin credit card after he was dead

1254
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:05,759
Because that's no problem

1255
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:10,879
If I ever died please feel free to use pretending he wasn't sure he was dead

1256
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:15,743
At the point that he was having a credit card

1257
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
Because

1258
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
Theoden

1259
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
And that's how

1260
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Who's going to pay off

1261
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Some of his

1262
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,423
I have $1,000 limit on this card

1263
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
So you can

1264
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:30,591
Dollars worth of s*** Montgomery Ward or whatever and then I will pay that off over time

1265
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
It'll give me time for

1266
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
The money is all both

1267
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
Credit card

1268
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,479
Started buying stuff after he was dead

1269
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
Mine

1270
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
Baldwin's got it

1271
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Real good stuff

1272
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,743
Also marks

1273
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,631
I don't know it just was 82 video camera

1274
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,935
Mark's wife at the time of the murder Karen

1275
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,751
Has gone on record and testified that she was surprised by the

1276
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,287
Money the Mark was spending in the days of

1277
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
Ali after the murder like

1278
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
When he bought a boat

1279
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
To take a body out.

1280
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
To the bank

1281
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:10,527
With the money that he took from Baldwin to try and Disposal Baldwin body

1282
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:14,623
Wow Mark bought a boat

1283
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,951
And she had no idea where the money was coming from because his business

1284
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
Going well

1285
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,535
Any old creditors like Baldwin

1286
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,375
She also it said that his behavior got really weird after the murder

1287
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,935
Including it repeating every Feedly ask

1288
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:34,335
Her if she would quote always love him no matter what which is a bad storm

1289
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:44,063
Before I tell you what the formation that you will always love

1290
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Thank you

1291
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,159
Thank you in advance I find a baby's vision

1292
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,463
Feel free to draw your own conclusions

1293
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Society for

1294
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,815
Hey honey just is a

1295
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,095
Pure hypothetical

1296
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
What state

1297
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
How would you feel

1298
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
Before it

1299
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
Wright-Patt would you still love me

1300
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
Okay

1301
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
How about that

1302
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,247
Send a text with Perris

1303
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,783
Just rambling about nonsense

1304
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
To present the idea that

1305
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
Mark was the

1306
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
Conspiracy Shore

1307
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,231
I know there's a lot of stuff about the case here at the beginning but I'm sure you will get to

1308
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,559
Crazy bulshit at the end

1309
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,983
This is an added note I believe Richard Baldwin was selected as a victim by the team within the military

1310
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,079
And at the highest levels of power in Britain and the US

1311
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,895
Responsible for framing Mark Richards

1312
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,503
I've come to the conclusion that the murder was orchestrated

1313
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
With hangover

1314
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,319
Selected as the Patsy

1315
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:52,415
Zerli history having been a victim of pedophilia

1316
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
And an unbalanced character

1317
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,511
I also believe

1318
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:02,911
There's an underlying pedophile ring this behind-the-scenes campaign targeting

1319
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Mike Richards

1320
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
It is also significant

1321
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:10,847
That the individuals involved in targeting Mark Richards

1322
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,663
Joanne Richards and myself at this time

1323
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,711
Come from Britain

1324
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,039
And I also understand

1325
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,831
That there is

1326
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,623
Some motivation with

1327
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
Which Within

1328
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,463
When I believe is mj-12 up

1329
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
Who gives a s***

1330
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
Sarasota

1331
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,351
Repackage

1332
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
Which some of the

1333
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,423
Hoover his

1334
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
We're part of Hawaii

1335
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,263
Or how Mark manipulated

1336
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:44,127
Murder part of it was that Mark knew that Hoover was

1337
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,919
Violently homophobic

1338
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
And so he told him to Baldwin

1339
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
When was gay

1340
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,295
And that was a part of the motivation that Mark

1341
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
The manipulation in order to get him

1342
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
Baldwin

1343
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,439
To do his bidding

1344
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,743
So this idea of

1345
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,023
Repackage that

1346
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,095
Has like a pedophile and Hoover was

1347
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
The victim of childhood

1348
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
Abuse

1349
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
That's everything

1350
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
It's just really ugly

1351
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
Really gross

1352
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,031
It's grows on a number of levels.

1353
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:17,663
In the same way that he was originally f***** by

1354
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,711
Doing boring

1355
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,551
The prop and then also just

1356
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
Conflating

1357
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,391
Conscious or on a

1358
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,951
Like an abstract level.

1359
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
Equivocate

1360
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,791
Homosexuality

1361
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
Is just discuss

1362
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,655
Always always pedophiles to get out of

1363
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,423
Any bulshit

1364
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,615
Everybody

1365
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:56,319
Blackmail anything I've ever done is probably set up by pedophile

1366
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
That just makes them

1367
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,391
Another connection

1368
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
To Alex

1369
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,463
Zoe

1370
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
So

1371
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,815
About the British

1372
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
What's going on again

1373
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,911
Now is this

1374
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,055
Specific

1375
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,359
Bradley idea that

1376
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
The British

1377
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
Just a guy

1378
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,991
So

1379
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:25,759
Next

1380
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Most of what she

1381
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,367
She says in this next clip is

1382
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,391
True

1383
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,463
But she's giving a different way that I believe

1384
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:40,351
All indications are that this targeting of March Mark Richards

1385
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:45,983
Is happening now after nearly 35 years since the verdict

1386
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,591
And this is because of my interviews with Captain Mark Richards

1387
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,663
Revealing the true nature of the alien presence

1388
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:57,503
Secret space program as well as space command

1389
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:03,135
And I believe that this targeting is aimed at further discrediting mark

1390
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
And

1391
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:08,767
And my work as well as the work of Joanne Richards marks why

1392
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
If you take the part of it being liked

1393
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
To cover up the truth about space

1394
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,911
Entirely at like

1395
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,959
Explain

1396
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:23,359
I am very motivated to discredit my

1397
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,391
Insinuating that everybody is

1398
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,255
Pedophile

1399
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,047
There are pedophiles

1400
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,631
And you are hurting bad

1401
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,911
Your enemies

1402
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
With

1403
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,287
Is Crying Wolf a little bit

1404
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,103
It's pretty gross osher there's another pedophile

1405
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,711
No actually there is one this time

1406
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
Accusation of

1407
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,599
Baldwin pedophile necessarily come

1408
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Songs for Mark Richard

1409
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,671
Yeah I'm not sure that it does eat May

1410
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
It Max

1411
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
From

1412
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
Another guy

1413
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,327
The guy who is a guest blogger

1414
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
On Project Campbell

1415
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655
And a lot of information

1416
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,679
The background

1417
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
In the research

1418
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
Very heavy

1419
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,543
Quotes about the case

1420
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
She's reading

1421
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,103
From a guy

1422
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
Paul Collin

1423
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,175
Who did a report

1424
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,967
Project Camelot

1425
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,271
Carrie has this to say about

1426
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,159
In order to be fully informed you must see the investigation done by kamelot blogger

1427
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
Call Colin

1428
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,255
And I have already

1429
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,583
So detailed. And again put the links

1430
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,935
I because this is such crucial information to get your facts right

1431
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
So you need

1432
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,495
If you're going to

1433
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
You're going to know the

1434
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,055
You know about reality

This is fun because she's spending a lot of

1438
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,687
True things like

1439
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,503
What do you mean

1440
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
I don't know

1441
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,575
You have to

1442
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
The reporting right

1443
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,647
This is a sensitive issue

1444
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
Right

1445
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,839
Call Lynn fralick

1446
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
Blogger on carries website

1447
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:29,055
He claims to be a former CIA agent but so does everyone carry talk to you soon

1448
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,359
However it

1449
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,407
So important that I see is evidence

1450
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,015
A researcher would I be if I didn't

1451
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:44,415
Poke around a little

1452
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
Brecht first things

1453
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,511
Reporting

1454
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:55,423
Copy and paste the URL for his report intershow transcript

1455
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,447
PDF file

1456
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
You can't copy from

1457
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,335
So in order to get his report you to type out this long string of the URL

1458
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,431
In fairness it does lead to an actual page that's

1459
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:11,807
I just brings up to vent a little bit at my frustration about how

1460
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:19,231
Really about Mark Richards Being Framed

1461
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,511
Nor is it really about any

1462
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
Truth about his case

1463
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,351
His report is mostly just trying to attack

1464
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,119
The character of

1465
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,399
Kevin Daniel Moore

1466
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:30,239
The British documentary filmmaker who's working on that docu-series

About Baldwin

1468
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775

And financial services

1472
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:43,295
As a corporate secretary in corporate

1473
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,135
Don't talk

1474
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
That's bully

1475
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,743
You could be a telemarketer if I

1476
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,839
I don't particularly care about

1477
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
Garbage

1478
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,911
Even if everything this guy is saying is

1479
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,519
Is true

1480
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,311
To do with what I know about Margaret

1481
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
This is a classic

1482
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Damaged

1483
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
Control and you know why they're doing

1484
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,199
Because what I told you earlier

1485
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
Because of some reason

1486
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,015
Possibly gas

1487
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,319
Kerry agreed to be interviewed for mores.

1488
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,879
From the trailer of it

1489
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
A very good life

1490
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,975
Some say it makes her look like a crazy person

1491
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,279
Looks at things

1492
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,375
Is going to agree because

1493
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
Cancer

1494
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
The truth

1495
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,495
I'm so this is what an Avenue to get her message

1496
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
To do that

1497
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
Interview

1498
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
Maybe

1499
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
It makes perfect

1500
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,199
It's it's it's a really vulnerable positions

1501
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,039
She doesn't have Final Cut

1502
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Is about

1503
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,367
Probably what you're going to do it

1504
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,415
Because she is

1505
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,231
If she is insulated by the

1506
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,511
Truth right

1507
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:01,119

Truth to power

1509
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,215
I love your passion

1510
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,311
Carrie knows if you made it

1511
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:15,711
Huge mistake

1512
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,991
Actual evidence of Mars

1513
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271

College and all of its going to illustrate the

1519
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,207
The fundamental truth

1520
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,487
That Mark Richard

1521
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,767
Is a sociopath

1522
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,303
Who's been calling people his whole life

1523
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,887
On some level knows that the producers of the documentary

1524
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:39,007
Really only have any interest in talking to her so she can be the example of his current victim

1525
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:42,591
Narrative

1526
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,383
Existing on challenge

1527
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,175
She can't argue with Casey

1528
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
Some effect

1529
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,015
She's left to do that all she can do is start rambling about Raptors

1530
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,807
So her only real strategies

1531
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,087
The painters documentarian

01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,159
Pedophile Network

01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
Is clearly working

1534
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,719
With the reptilians

1535
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,511
Mark's Noble Crusade

1536
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
It's painfully transparent

1537
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,655
Get all the facts

1538
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:10,239
By going to this guest bloggers website right is hers

Get your facts straight and him saying

1540
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:19,199
Miriam is sucks for the aliens

1541
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,247
So we don't like

1542
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,855
Deteriorate halfway through it to a defense

1543
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,903
Read about how great

1544
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,183
Is boring

1545
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,815
Furthermore Kerry Cassidy exercises professionalism

1546
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,863

If people want a fair-haired version

1549
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,031
Alex Jones like gorillas journalism broadcast

1550
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,823
Then they know where to turn there at

1551
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:51,455
Well that was a little bit on the nose

1552
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:57,855
Lower the volume

1553
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,391
Just on the fact

1554
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Paul Collins article is a

1555
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
Trash

1556
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,231
He gets very basic

1557
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Princeton

1558
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,375
He claims that Andrew was criminally charged with murder but that is not

1559
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
True

1560
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,935
He goes on to even say that Andrew was

1561
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,471
The prison for the murder

1562
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,007
Is categorically false

1563
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:19,359
It even is counter to the version of the story that Carrie is presenting on this episode the word listen

1564
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
He is f*** it up

1565
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,455
If you

1566
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,479
Kind of really Bass

1567
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,063
I can't get myself to engage at this other unsourced

1568
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
Assertion

1569
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,903
Impossibly libelous claims about Baldwin being a pedophile

1570
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
Although

1571
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,975
That's another parallel.

1572
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,279
We'd be remiss not to point that out

1573
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,863
However I should point out that on September 4th 28th

1574
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,191
Paul Collin posted a Blog on Project

1575

It's a very forgiving system that set up

The Uso of the government

1650
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,839

4 clearly states

1658
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,599
But they don't refer any loans for litigation

1659
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:16,159
Except in cases where they are more than

1660
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
A year overdue on pay

1661
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:23,583
Know where do they say that they'll Place liens on people who don't pay although I do

1662
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,679
The collection agencies that you can subcontract I think it's possible

1663
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,471
But according to the US code 18

1664
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,751
I prefer to just apply

1665
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Some fees

1666
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
And they only litigating anyway

1667
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
If you're a

1668
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
Year overdue on a payment

1669
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:40,223
Tired

1670
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,807
If you have a $2,500 repatriation loan I'm positive you

1671
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,343
You could get it cut down into

1672
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,879
Like I don't know

1673
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,695
15 payments

1674
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
$200

1675
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,791
Take a little extra and

1676
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,815
Drop it down at the time

1677
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:59,167
Vets or whatever

1678
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,447
Whatever it is

1679
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,727
He's probably

1680
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,519
Just had a $200 bill that he

1681
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,055
Unpaid for a year

1682
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,871
If this is even true at all

1683
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,943
So I don't know

1684
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,735
He seems real scam

1685
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
And this I need

1686
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
$2,500

1687
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,575
Post

01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Is it

1689
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,367
Serious red flag

1690
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,927
Anthony also posted.

1691
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,999
Things on Project

1692
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
Red flag

1693
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,095
22 hours

1694
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
All he could write

1695
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:35,775
Please desperately give me money is that short piece and it really looks like a Nigerian

1696
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,663
Bab also his post sounds like roommates

1697
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
Used to have

1698
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:48,831
I would love to be your roommate for this apartment will get this all together

1699
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,927
In order for me to do so though I'm going to need you to

1700
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,095
I think it's a simpler version of that that is just

1701
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,119
It's almost like

1702
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,703
Here is a crisis give us money

1703
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,823
The carry linked to about Mark Richards

1704
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:13,919
Haven't made me any more informed about the murder that Mark totally orchestrated

1705
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,479
Give me a chance to learn

1706
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:21,343
Creation loans silver lining

1707
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,439
Talking about Mark

1708
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
Just not true

1709
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:32,607
Around the time of the murder Mark had want more than one Construction Company

1710
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,935
He supervised the cruise that reported to him

1711
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,775
And he had hundreds of people in the secret space program

1712
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,823
Or secret space command

1713
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,871
Who reported to him

1714
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,663
Mark didn't have a name for his

1715
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,199
Construction business he didn't have

1716
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
To f******

1717
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,735
Construction business

1718
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:53,343
It's very clear you talkin about it not going

1719
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,391
The business is not going well

1720
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,183
He has like

1721
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,487
They ask you how many people he has working for him

1722
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
He says it's like

1723
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,535
Egypt

1724
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
You talkin about how one guy who sold

1725
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,863
Begun to who works for him

1726
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
It is like

1727
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:08,703
He's not working for you now right inside

1728
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:12,031
We don't have any work for it

1729
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,055
Selectors

1730
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,616
Not a ton of work to do handyman employee 26

1731
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:20,992
People that he has working for him are Andrew and crossy

1732
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:25,088
They probably those the only people on the crew that are actively working

1733
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,672
Emporium numbers of 5 other guys

1734
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Baby needs

1735
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,512
Yeah you'll subcontract out

1736
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:36,864
If you're Illinois Illinois in the Midwest

1737
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,936
Act like 13 you'll get your first detasseling job

1738
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,568
Teacher at my school who just show up with

1739
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
Half bus

1740
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:49,920
To be like

1741
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,736
They got real busy

1742
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,040
I mean I work for my

1743
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
Myself but I

1744
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,112
Bogart

1745
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,840
Husband

1746
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,888
Weed killer

1747
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,472
So if it's nightclub Carrie brings up

1748
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
She thinks

1749
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
Is proven marks

1750
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,080
In some way but it actually makes

1751
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
So much

1752
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:25,248
Apparently there is also another young man named Willie Robles

1753
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,344
He was not charged but may have had something to do with the murder

1754
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,488
Mark says that Robles was dating Hoover sister at the time

1755
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:40,608
Who is dating Hoover sister at the time and was said to go around

1756
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,448
Saying he would bash someone's head in with a baseball bat

1757
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
If he got angry

1758
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:50,080
And this does mirror what happened in the murder apparently

1759
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,360
Apparently

1760
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:55,456
Robles might actually be the person

1761
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Killed Baldi

1762
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,040
In reality William Robles

1763
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:02,112
Is one of two other youths

1764
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
Approach them

1765
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,416
With his plan to murder Baldwin

1766
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,440
And sell his shift

1767
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
Make a load of cash

1768
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:10,048
Attack their credibility

1769
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
You're trying to cut it

1770
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,912
It is true that one of those not Robles the other guy

1771
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:19,264
Was arrested for selling marijuana

1772
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,080
The author of Declaration

1773
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
Swearing that kneeled Robles

1774
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,664
We're never offered any promise

1775
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
Anyway

1776
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,760
So that's all a load of

1777
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,320
The existence of these two other people is really

1778
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
The piece of evidence

1779
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
PetSmart

1780
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:39,232
Additional people have sworn testimony

1781
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,536
Identical to the one that he eventually

1782
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Carryout

1783
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,584
So

1784
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,144
Yep

1785
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
Lizards

1786
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,728
Couldn't couldn't rewrite the

1787
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
We're creatures of habit

1788
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,664
It's real nuts

1789
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,688
To see all of this

1790
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,552
Jillian's

1791
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
I like it

1792
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,720
Tu VI d

1793
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
That's quite a bit.

1794
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,584
It is in some ways admirable in other ways

1795
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,376
Real feelings of

1796
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,680
The human race

1797
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,776
It's Ian Abramson level commitment to affect

1798
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:29,664
So we get back to the idea of Baldwin being a pedophile

1799
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:40,416
The way that Mark learn to Baldwin was a pedophile

1800
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:45,536
Is it marks company was hired to remodel Baldwin's house

1801
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:49,632
Mark screw called him one day at the beginning of the job to say

1802
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:54,752
They found a huge amount of c********* in the house saying you won't believe what we found

1803
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,824
So Mark was contracted to work on

1804
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,640
His house

1805
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,040
Extension

1806
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,856
Any fix that fence Hoover might've hit

1807
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
We're not entirely sure

1808
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,208
New wrinkle

1809
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,256
And if this is true which it's not

1810
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,328
Discovered that Baldwin had

1811
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,608
Child

1812
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,144
I didn't report him to

1813
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,448
It also means that Mark

1814
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
Disclosure

1815
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:30,080
Three hour-long interview with detectives after he was arrested for the murder

1816
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,128
It also means that Mark didn't bring this up

1817
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,688
Ever Nordic Crossing Hoover or and

1818
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,992
People who work in my Baldwin's house

1819
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:41,344
They were the contractors who were there working on it

1820
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,880
Maybe we're the ones who

1821
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,928
Carrie is implying sound

1822
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,488
Well let's just go and have them brought this up ever

1823
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
Let you go even

1824
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,072
Tiny bit more into making sense

1825
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,376
You need money

1826
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,656
Right

1827
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
You have

1828
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,240
This plan

1829
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
And your plan is to kill this guy

1830
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,104
You find out that he has child pronography

1831
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,640
But you're not going to report to the

1832
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,688
Now why kill him

1833
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,968
When you could block me

1834
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,760
That makes the most sense

1835
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
To everybody

1836
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,576
You don't have to

1837
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,000
Yeah

1838
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:24,096
You're a white separatist who's trying to create his own

1839
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,520
You have a knife

1840
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,336
I really look at this and ISS

1841
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:38,432
Part of an attempt to minimize the death of Richard bald

1842
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,760
Of course it's a cruel tactic to make

1843
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,552
Coming

1844
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,624
Collection of child pronography

1845
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,904
Right

1846
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,672
Admit

1847
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,696
Guilt on marks

1848
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:53,792
Part but subconsciously she's implanting in the listener's mind the idea of like

1849
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,840
If he did it was because he was hurting kids

1850
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
Girl fine with it

1851
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:05,056
Are you really going to do a life sentence for murdering a pedophile

1852
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,664
It's insane if

1853
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,456
Margarita

1854
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
Should have gone to prison

1855
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
First of all

1856
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
I don't know

1857
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,720
Until you prove it

1858
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,000
Go fuc yourself

1859
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,024
With your stray accusation

1860
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,560
That's sort of

1861
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,144
We've been talkin about Marc rich

1862
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:30,912
For a long

1863
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,216
Play today but for our life

1864
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:39,616
We've been talking about it with that because he's faster

1865
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,384
Mark Richards

1866
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
The gift that keeps on

1867
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,944
Doesn't seem to stop yet

1868
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Jordan

1869
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,296
The whole time we've been operating under the

1870
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
The assumption that Mark

1871
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
Was off-planet

1872
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,600
When the murder

1873
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Rihanna

1874
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,608
Says the same thing is

1875
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,912
Like you mentioned it in that interview with

1876
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:06,240
The cops

1877
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,264
Either

1878
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:08,800
Clip

1879
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,336
We get a new alibi

1880
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
Even I like it I like a new Alibis isn't

1881
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,160
Mark's Alibi during the exact time of the murder was that he was eating lunch

1882
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,720
With his parents at his parents house

1883
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,280
His lawyer Shapiro

1884
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,352
Told him that would never be believed by the jury

1885
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:37,728
However it is notable that they could never Place Mark at the scene of the crime

1886
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:41,824
Mark states that he had just returned from fighting a war in the Falklands

1887
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,872
In which she was in

1888
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,944
In a battle for the control of planet Earth

1889
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:52,064
This was a turning point in the history of Earth and

1890
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,904
If we had lost the battle we lost control over

1891
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,720
It was a battle with the alien races

1892
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,280
Detroit Tiger reptilians and grays

1893
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,072
The Raptors

1894
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:07,680
And for more about the Raptors please do see my other nine interviews with

1895
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,960
Captain Mark Richards

1896
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,032
But the Raptors are featured in Steven Spielberg

1897
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:15,360
Jurassic world and other films

1898
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,408
Very specifically

1899
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,200
Bucked up

1900
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,040
Planet all the time and now it's like

1901
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,856
Make a disclaimer at the beginning of the episode said he was off

1902
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,416
Lunch with

1903
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,208
His parents and his lawyers thought

1904
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,768
That exact

1905
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:38,144
Time of the murder as well right and by the way is he was fighting in the Falklands even if you was fighting aliens

1906
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,424
Planet

1907
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,264
Is our planet is out the window

1908
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,056
It was the off-planet

1909
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,224
I forgot

1910
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,296
Grade school

1911
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,344
If you lose the Falkland you'll lose the

1912
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
The plant everybody

1913
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,024
Comeback

1914
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
That's f***** up

1915
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,888
I mean like

1916
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,912
That he was fighting off

1917
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,472
Planet would be that he was in a plane

1918
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,056
And that's off the ground

1919
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,104
That's a shady technicality

1920
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,640
You could have just asked your

1921
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
You could have just asked

1922
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,712
I don't think I would talk to

1923
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:30,368
Why would a lawyer say that they would believe that

1924
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,744
Yeah absolutely

1925
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,816
Yeah that's right

1926
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,120
Aaron

1927
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,400
It's over like a 7

1928
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,168
19 year old

1929
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,264
Who work for him if it's like there could be establishing

1930
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,544
Like if there would be evidence

1931
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,384
Sorted out

1932
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,968
Also small Point Richard Baldwin was murdered on July 6th

1933
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,992
It's the 1982

1934
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,528
The war in the Falklands ended on

1935
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
June 14th

1936
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,648
Mark absolutely wasn't

1937
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,952
The Falklands War but even if he was he

1938
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:12,096
He could have easily been in that conflict and still made it back in time to murder Richard Baldwin so that's

1939
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:16,448
Is not an alibi

1940
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
The other month

1941
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,544
June 6th

1942
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,336
July 14th almost home

1943
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,616
Protonix

1944
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:29,504
By the way almost no us

1945
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,296
5 Personnel in Farkle

1946
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,856
That was Britain and Argentina

1947
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,136
Beetlejuice

1948
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,160
Keep forgetting come on

1949
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,696
Reset like missiles

1950
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,744
And maybe a couple people

1951
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:46,144
It was almost entirely the British of the Argentinian

1952
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:52,544
Rebuttal is what ruined my document

1953
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,408
It's not zero music

1954
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,064
Still does not prove

1955
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,136
Doubtful that he didn't kill Robert Richard

1956
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,000
This is the problem I don't want to read his book now

1957
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:15,072
Because he's at 40 years to write a good alibi

1958
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,096
He's not.

1959
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,192
That's true I need a copy

1960
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:20,960
I want to read

1961
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
Obviously

1962
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:26,848
There's no way

1963
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,640
We know

1964
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,664
That Mark got setup

1965
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,432
We know that

1966
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
Now

1967
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,504
Teri Brewster case

1968
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,088
None

1969
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:37,856
Opposite

1970
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:38,880
Swiss cheese

1971
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,160
Zero holes

1972
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,976
Jupiter in that it is

1973
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,512
Is 100% solid

1974
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,864
Right

1975
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,144
Exactly

1976
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,472
I told Carrie

1977
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
But I think

1978
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
Awesome

1979
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,824
And Mark claims that the rapper

1980
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,616
Raptors had his back

1981
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,920
And we're at his beck and call

1982
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:06,016
And he was very arrogant back then he was 29

1983
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,344
Lauren McLaughlin

1984
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,160
About how the Raptors saw him as a hero

1985
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:16,512
He stated it was possibly because of this they framed him for murder

1986
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,816
Although she doesn't know that for certain

1987
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,120
But it's a pretty good theory

1988
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:24,704
Around in the Falklands these little brat

1989
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,104
He's a little raggedy

1990
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,504
None of the Dutchman he thought he was right

1991
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,040
Americans

1992
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,856
He's going to brag a little bit

1993
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,392
And then they got to come down

1994
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,720
What are the Raptors the reptilians

1995
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,000
The Draco Alliance

1996
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Does it work

1997
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,632
I like that idea I really love it you're bragging too much about your alien cult

1998
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
Do you have a gas

1999
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,192
Hero worshipping

2000
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,776
F*** you bro sprinkler murder

2001
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,592
The story of hubris

2002
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,616
Absolutely

2003
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,224
That marks dad was in play

2004
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:11,552
Around the time of the murder

2005
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,880
Started and finished it

2006
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,512
No worries good but

2007
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,048
It's really weird

2008
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,096
Pick the Falklands War as like

2009
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,632
Dwarf

2010
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,704
Did we will lose control of

2011
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,984
The planet if we lost

2012
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,008
The Falklands War

2013
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,568
Because I mean first of all it's very short war

2014
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,152
United States

2015
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,200
United Kingdom

2016
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,784
I did he may have been wrapped

2017
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,320
The Peter Falk

2018
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
No I see

2019
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,624
Speed last

2020
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,184
Really major world of that before

2021
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,000
Yeah I would absolutely

2022
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:57,888
Thinks it's such a big deal.

2023
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,704
Put it the routes named Major

2024
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
And it have to be

2025
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,776
So

2026
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,384
Hear this next news about the Dutchman

2027
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,920
What he was up to around 2

2028
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:13,504
Also around the time of the murder

2029
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,552
Alyssa Boyd Richards

2030
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,344
Mark's father

2031
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,416
Was seen as a hero by the British and American

2032
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:24,000
Air Force and had just returned from fighting a war

2033
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,048
With aliens

2034
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,376
Kamchatka Russia

2035
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,424
Mark has been playing risk

2036
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,472
Imprisoned because that's one of the parts

2037
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,800
Let's connect

2038
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:43,200
Russia to the United States around

2039
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:49,088
Brown bear brought up recruits

2040
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:54,720
104

2041
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,536
She amazing

2042
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,376
They don't actually have the piece

2043
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:04,704
For the rest board you have to

2044
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
With aliens

2045
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
Cool right around that time

2046
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
Drake

2047
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,248
Lexcorp carry talk

2048
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:20,832
Talks about how earlier you know how I brought up

2049
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,856
Andymark

2050
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,880
Is there arch nemesis

2051
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,512
Astoria

2052
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,792
True man

2053
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,472
Dear this is just

2054
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:41,312
This is just whatever enjoy this not true story about Carrie

2055
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,592
I have a life at risk

2056
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,360
Or some s***

2057
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:47,200
A side-note Project Camelot was directly threatened

2058
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,016
Uber forced to abruptly closed down

2059
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:56,160
We were told people would die including us if we pursued an important line of research

2060
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,696
Evolving Alex

2061
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:04,096
Document from Angleton files we were forced to abruptly closed down our investigation and fly back home

2062
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:09,728
At the time we had been scheduled to do an interview with a key contact

2063
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:13,824
When we received a phone call in our hotel room telling us

2064
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
To stop

2065
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,200
We decided not to pursue our investigation after being threatened

2066
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,784
Source is related to our investigation

2067
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,832
Would be tails

2068
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:29,184
As a consequence the Angleton connection to the mark Richards case

2069
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,000
Reveals a very high and deep reason

2070
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:35,328
For him having been framed and in prison now

2071
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,376
For nearly 40 years

2072
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,448
We are very aware of How High the Angleton

2073
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,728
Connection goes

2074
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,800
With regard to the alien situation

2075
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,592
I'm very aware of how high you

2076
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
Sound

2077
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,384
This is b*******

2078
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
Yeah that's

2079
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:52,224
Ridiculous my firm just like boilerplate response

2080
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,248
So that is

2081
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:58,112
I don't even care I don't care at all I want

2082
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,928
Anytime I get super dry

2083
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,488
I really wish that blackout Jordan

2084
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
Call

2085
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:10,144
All the time is it

2086
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,424
They did absolutely

2087
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,960
Fantastic

2088
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
We were going to

2089
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:17,312
Here's the real story we were going to interview this Soros and the guy was like

2090
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:23,968
I really want to come in there like

2091
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,784
I was probably

2092
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,720
That would work

2093
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:38,048
Maybe you'd be her next big whistleblower

2094
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,096
Terry prison

2095
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Mark Richard

2096
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:45,216
Was

2097
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,240
Testimony of this

2098
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,032
Andrew the other guy

2099
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
Another kid

2100
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,640
True

2101
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,200
Also not

2102
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,528
With regard to the trial according to mark

2103
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:03,904
Relied exclusively on information provided by Andrew

2104
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:09,280
See above and there appears that Andrew was highly likely

2105
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:13,376
To have been a CIA undercover agent on the scene

2106
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:16,704
Orchestrating events while Hoover was the Patsy

2107
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
Okay yeah.

2108
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,800
Yeah yeah you're old

2109
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,616
Psyop operation

2110
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:27,712
Lincoln

2111
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:29,760
So

2112
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,064
This is so stupid

2113
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,368
This is just

2114
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,904
Disappointingly stupid

2115
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,208
Beating the ship

2116
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,792
It's like Mark would say it

2117
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,096
I get that

2118
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,656
Total steps

2119
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,960
Absolutely

2120
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,984
Nopal

2121
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,032
Carry a discipline

2122
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,640
I have no face of you and I'm disappointed

2123
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,176
The idea that you're saying

2124
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,968
The seventeen-year-old Who mark

2125
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
Completely

2126
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:04,064
Lured into this murder plot

2127
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:05,856
Locked up

2128
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:11,232
Embarrassing

2129
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,000
Projector

2130
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
Write out those words

2131
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,352
And just projected up on carries wall

2132
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
Angela Carey

2133
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,912
You said that

2134
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:19,936
Yeah yeah

2135
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:23,008
Do you want to read that out loud

2136
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
I'm sure

2137
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
Or at least he's willing

2138
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,224
What's up times two

2139
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:38,112
She is still saying that like this is what Mark said

2140
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,928
Right

2141
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:45,536
You have a responsibility

2142
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,816
Full of s***

2143
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,120
At least a little

2144
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,912
Introduce some sort of

2145
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
Skeptical

2146
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,704
Voice to the

2147
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:55,776
Horseland

2148
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,080
Text Cliff you know

2149
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,152
Margaret divorce

2150
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,504
The murder Burger

2151
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,600
Oh that's why I got a video camera not good

2152
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,624
Keep the camera

2153
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,256
Get the boat I don't think so I think it was

2154
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,840
So you got a divorce

2155
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,376
But it turns out

2156
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,680
The mob made

2157
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:27,264
The mop Karen Marks

2158
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,616
Divorced him during the trial Mark believe she was pressured by the mob

2159
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,176
Apparently have

2160
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:34,944
Family

2161
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,248
Her father who had ties to the Mob

2162
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,528
The mod 1.8

2163
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,832
The judge fell asleep during

2164
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
The trial

2165
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,392
I don't blame them

2166
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:50,048
Stop blaming

2167
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,608
Unconnected clock

2168
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,360
Away from that 131-page interview

2169
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,896
He's doing to them what he does to

2170
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,456
Important takeaway

2171
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,736
Cuz it shows his pattern

2172
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,016
Like the way he works

2173
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:14,112
With new information being integrated

2174
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:20,000
Trying to play but these detectives are like

2175
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:22,560
You f***** up so much

2176
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:27,680
Stone like absolutely

2177
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:30,496
You still got that same pattern every time or it's like

2178
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:34,592
Do this happen

2179
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:38,432
Don't you get bored

2180
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,760
It's a matter of boredom

2181
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,528
Compulsion

2182
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:45,088
Like I don't know who are

2183
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,368
Compulsive liars

2184
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:49,440
They're not really control of being able

2185
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,048
Play Bright

2186
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,328
Some conduit Morse for

2187
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:58,144
Squeezing others but the LIE is almost like

2188
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,168
A-Tech

2189
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:03,008
Never met somebody

2190
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
Really

2191
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,616
Hard about it

2192
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,152
Is that like oftentimes

2193
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,992
Consequential things

2194
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,552
And we didn't write

2195
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
Start to realize accused

2196
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
Can't control it

2197
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
I mean it's not a terrible

2198
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,440
Call strategy either.

2199
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:23,232
Lie about everything all the time

2200
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:25,024
Because then you don't even know if you're like

2201
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,816
I know you lie all the time about

2202
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:31,936
I think that strategy is over

2203
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
Because I think you

2204
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,496
Sounds like a lot of me

2205
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,664
Exodus finger gun that's the first thing I did

2206
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,480
Is like you get a real understanding and appreciation

2207
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
Is pattern Italy

2208
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,064
And then the second thing I take away from

2209
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,344
He's f****** boring

2210
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,904
It takes forever for them to go

2211
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,184
Anywhere Within

2212
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:53,952
Conversation

2213
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,232
He's talking circles

2214
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,280
Trying to play a little game

2215
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
And stuff like that

2216
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,072
The boring game

2217
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:02,912
Yeah so that's why it takes 131 pages to get through What would

2218
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,936
Probably

2219
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,472
740

2220
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,008
If I it wasn't

2221
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:07,776
It's full of him being

2222
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:10,592
Now I know you're going to walk out

2223
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:15,968
Boring life

2224
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,760
Just tell him we know what happened

2225
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,320
Very very short

2226
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:23,136
Yes I do but the point I'm trying to make

2227
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,928
But like if this judge fell asleep

2228
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
I get one

2229
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,768
Cuz I'm sure

2230
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,304
Yeah I'm surprised

2231
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,072
The two cops info

2232
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,632
Play but 1.4 coffee like

2233
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,216
Let's go get some coffee

2234
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,752
Jesus Christ

2235
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,640
Yeah I'm sure if there was a recorder in the coffee room serve you like f****** a******

2236
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,432
So

2237
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,200
All of

2238
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,784
Is predicated on the idea

2239
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,320
That Richard Baldwin

2240
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,344
Is dead

2241
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,112
Because he got more

2242
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,184
Ono is Richard Baldwin

2243
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
Leslie Mart

2244
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,280
Stated that it is also possible

2245
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,096
Baldwin is alive and well and it Witness

Nope program

2249
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,360
Witness Protection

2251
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,968
Mark told me

2252
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
We have to wait until

2253
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,856
Two episodes of Project Camelot

2254
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,648
From now where Carrie starts

2255
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,208
These things but without the Mark told me

2256
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,232
Yeah

2257
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
If not

2258
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,328
Still alive

2259
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,352
He was a murder

2260
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,192
The baseball bat and screwdriver

2261
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Sidibe

2262
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,752
Tie down with a motor

2263
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,032
From the boat

2264
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,080
Very amateur izle

2265
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:47,360
That's why is Bob

2266
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:50,176
Surface

2267
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,968
Marco's arrested

2268
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,272
Testimony

2269
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,088
After you've been killed like that

2270
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,880
And you float up

2271
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,160
Bread

2272
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,208
Yeah yeah

2273
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:05,024
There's a great moment

2274
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,328
There's a great moment one of my other favorites

2275
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
That interview wear

2276
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,936
They asked a question

2277
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,704
And Marcus

2278
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,472
Responding to

2279
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,496
News about something

2280
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,264
Get Donna cup

2281
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,288
Apple day prior

2282
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,824
And one of the detectives like

2283
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:24,224
Do you think we were

2284
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:32,928
It's like those moments in like they're really funny joke because it's Mark Richard

2285
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,464
Put myself

2286
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,488
Situation

2287
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
Feeling

2288
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,280
Earrings

2289
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,840
Hold on

2290
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:42,144
Darius

2291
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,424
Amazon

2292
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:48,032
Nevertheless she persisted

2293
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,408
So little

2294
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,432
Little do you know that

2295
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Marxism

2296
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
Absolutely

2297
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,184
And it's only

2298
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,024
Right after the

2299
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,072
The DIA

2300
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,096
The defense

2301
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,120
Intelligence age

2302
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,912
They put out a

2303
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,448
Exonerate

2304
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,496
Prove

2305
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
That he was totally

2306
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,128
Western office break room

2307
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,176
Special net

2308
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:29,504
Every heart was arrested the DIA

2309
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,088
Defense intelligence agency put together a report

2310
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:35,904
That refuted every charge against mark

2311
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:38,976
Mark believes that report still exist

2312
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:44,096
At the time there were several paper copies of the report made and distributed

2313
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,400
Which was in 1982

2314
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:50,496
And also it was sent to the DA's office

2315
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:56,896
The report was supposedly has disappeared but there are still copies around

2316
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:57,920
And if

2317
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
Found

2318
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,504
It would instantly freemark

2319
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,528
Ain't going to happen

2320
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,808
Eastsound

2321
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,088
It ain't going to happen

2322
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,208
My friend

2323
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:10,976
My friend

2324
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:11,744
That report.

2325
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,816
I can say that with

2326
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,584
Almost

2327
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:21,984
Complete certainty

2328
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:26,848
Believable at all I'm going to look it up

2329
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,640
Could not

2330
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:31,200
But this could just be a fake

2331
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,272
But you just showed you

2332
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:40,672
Your cards that you don't know a lot about the government structure

2333
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,696
Comes up all that off

2334
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:45,280
Pretty much just

2335
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,816
Military intelligence

2336
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,400
It's not something that's relevant to most

2337
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,472
Normal conversation

2338
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,032
It does

2339
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,944
This documentary make

2340
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:03,968
This British guy

2341
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:05,760
And

2342
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,296
They're really grasping

2343
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,320
Get straws trying to do

2344
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,856
Discredit him and you'll see what I mean

2345
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:15,744
See the background of Kam as detailed in the investigation

2346
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,024
By Paul Collins

2347
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,376
One of the key things about that individual

2348
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:23,424
Is that he has a

2349
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:26,752
I guess it's sex shop

2350
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,520
In

2351
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,544
Amsterdam

2352
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:33,152
And it's very possible that that's linked

2353
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:33,920
2

2354
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,736
Is the mob and

2355
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
To the game Mafia excetera

2356
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,624
And that's my conjecture not marks

2357
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:49,280
You

2358
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,608
Anybody who has a sex

2359
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:56,704
Stop is conceivably in the mafia or working with the gay Mafia

2360
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,984
Really forgot

2361
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,288
Okay

2362
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,080
Yes his wife

2363
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,360
Divorced him because

2364
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:07,456
There's a lot of vague mob s*** going on

2365
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,320
Divorce the gay Mafia

2366
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,856
Shopping apps

2367
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:20,256
Amsterdam

2368
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:26,400
Is there a gay Mafia

2369
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:30,496
Right I know there's a number

2370
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:33,824
Academy Award winners

2371
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:39,456
Weakest

2372
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:46,880
Or someone who has the same name as him runs a sex shop

2373
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,184
Completely moved

2374
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,232
I do not give a s***

2375
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:53,792
In the doctor

2376
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:55,840
This guy

2377
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,632
Track down people

2378
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,656
Like this pen pal

2379
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,264
Mark's ex-wife

2380
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:05,568
One of the other people that he Tracked Down

2381
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,336
Was someone who

2382
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:07,360
To work for Mark

2383
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,896
Did not want to talk to

2384
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,200
Is very suspicious

2385
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:14,016
Bingo

2386
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:19,648
And one of the people km has contacted is someone who works for Mark

2387
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:23,744
This person refused the interview and his loyal tomorrow

2388
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,584
Mark States the only way can't km

2389
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,936
Could have gotten the man's name is from the side of the government

2390
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:32,960
Involved

2391
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,496
With framing him

2392
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:38,336
This contributes to prove the km has been tasked

2393
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,360
Buy them

2394
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:42,432
To further discredit Mark Richards and in the process

2395
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,224
Joanne Richards and me

2396
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:46,272
Can I offer an alternative explanation

2397
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
He just asked

2398
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:50,112
Some people faster route

2399
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:56,512
San Rafael Linda started asking around with contractors like 60

2400
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:04,448
3rd the 7th interview

2401
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:14,688
Different prison in Vacaville

2402
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:18,528
Talking about this

2403
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:21,088
Documentarian finding someone who used to work for him in

2404
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,112
Contracting

2405
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,928
They're saying

2406
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:31,328
Because he's loyal to Mark although the alternative also as possible 25 to be involved

2407
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,096
Which is

2408
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,888
SmartPay remember that

2409
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:38,752
Remember that thing that happened that really f***** everything up for you and kind of made people

2410
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:45,152
Will talk to you about it over and over and over and over again you don't want to really really feel like

2411
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:52,320
Okay then work good

2412
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,600
Really Bass

2413
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,624
Journalistic

2414
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,184
Investigative journalist has skills could find out

2415
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:57,952
People who work

2416
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,000
Like it we if you go to

2417
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:03,328
To like go to Northern California go round

2418
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:06,144
People go to the

2419
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,168
Relevant figures

2420
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,960
Talk to Mark Richards

2421
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:15,360
Ex-wife would know some of the people that work there until at least be able to point them in the right direction to find someone who does

2422
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:22,528
He also interviewed The Crossing

2423
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:28,928
Who else work exactly giving me the name

2424
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:30,976
Government

2425
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:32,256
Is proof that there

2426
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:34,304
He's in on the frame job

2427
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,072
Nonsense

2428
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,984
Km is working for the luciferian

2429
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:45,056
Rebellion also known as The Reptilian

2430
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:45,824
Play

2431
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,360
Draco Alliance

2432
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:48,384
That's

2433
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:49,920
That looks

2434
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:51,456
Seferian

2435
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,992
Those are those are

2436
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,296
We're done with the

2437
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,576
Navigate

2438
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:59,136
To jump to the reporting

2439
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
Cuz you know Mark Richard

2440
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
No s***

2441
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,792
This is Olga

2442
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,328
Carrie's making a

2443
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,864
I tripped out of this goddamn prison

2444
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,912
Doll pencil

2445
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,192
She's not going to

2446
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,728
Just do that is like

2447
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:14,496
Control

2448
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,520
And running interference

2449
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,824
For her number one whistleblower

2450
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:23,200
Exactly Piper Piper

2451
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,736
Exactly

2452
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,808
We get to

2453
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
They didn't even bother

2454
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
Talking to

2455
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:37,280
Minerva's in the Wind

2456
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:39,328
We don't know where she is.

2457
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:44,704
Enervate

2458
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,568
So we get to

2459
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,360
Clip where were talking

2460
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,128
Marc rich

2461
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
Info

2462
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,688
Like his is his

2463
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,224
Weak right

2464
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,016
Not good

2465
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,296
Look it's not that excited

2466
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:00,576
But it is

2467
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,624
Kind of blow Hardy and V

2468
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,928
Okay I like that

2469
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,232
The end so it's worth it for that but

2470
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,512
I'm not happy that this is

2471
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,816
The first one cuz I wanted to come in with a Raptors eat

2472
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:14,400
Chocolate kind of vague

2473
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
Stupid

2474
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,704
Like I said

2475
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
I enjoy the

2476
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:21,568
Mark agrees with the following concepts

2477
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:22,848
1

2478
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:24,896
Is that there are many different timeline

2479
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:29,504
The Earth is a hologram and that this whole

2480
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,784
Galaxy

2481
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:32,832
Multiverse is in essence

2482
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:35,136
Probably a series of holograms

2483
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,416
You see what I'm saying this

2484
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:40,768
What kind of bland boring stuff for hold your horses

2485
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:46,656
Humans have simultaneous incarnations and reincarnate

2486
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,472
Time and space are simultaneous

2487
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,776
Mark thinks that our brain

2488
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:56,640
Can assist other versions of ourselves on other timeline

2489
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:02,528
And yes there are armies of Androids and underground bases both under under the US

2490
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,064
And in China

2491
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,880
Underground and he has seen the Chinese

2492
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,648
Android

2493
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,464
Isn't that great that turn isn't that amazing

2494
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:19,424
Another version of yourself in another reality

2495
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:23,008
Of course we really need to settle this I know everybody's been wondering

2496
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,312
Yes there are Android underneath

2497
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:31,200
The underground area is lousy with

2498
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:33,760
Yeah that

2499
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,552
Yes

2500
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:38,112
I got this question

2501
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,160
Once and for all

2502
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:40,928
Android

2503
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,840
Terry's community

2504
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,168
More paranoid paranormal

2505
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,496
Takeover of the

2506
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,264
The Earth

2507
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,056
Snooze

2508
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,336
It's already

2509
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:02,688
The Takeover of planet Earth has actually already happened

2510
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:06,016
We are battling the 6A eyes ongoing

2511
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:10,880
We are also battling the Draco reptilians and certain species of Gray's

2512
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,904
Directly

2513
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,744
Big Ray's report to the wraps the wraps report to the Draco

2514
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:18,304
They are using AI as well

2515
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,840
And The Troggs

2516
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:23,168
Also unacceptable HSBC

2517
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:25,472
There also are working against us

2518
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:31,104
Tuff Stuff

2519
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:32,896
We are busy

2520
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:39,296
Bright

2521
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:43,648
I need to know where the spiders are

2522
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:50,048
Music piano WrestleMania is coming up this weekend and it just it's like we're in a cage match and it is a handicap

2523
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:53,888
It is a f****** with us

2524
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,424
Clearly

2525
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,192
Regimen

2526
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:56,960
Rented

2527
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:01,056
Hierarchical structure of aliens overall against

2528
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:05,408
That's not good that's bad really mean

2529
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,480
Marley's doctor group

2530
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,880
I don't know anymore about the AI

2531
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,744
6 AI

2532
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:21,280
It does feel

2533
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,168
6A II alone are f****** with the entire speech

2534
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:34,080
Important but it's not apparently

2535
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:36,384
Because we don't get any clarification

2536
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,712
So taking it from that

2537
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,992
Space

2538
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,272
Now we get

2539
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,296
Terrestrial

2540
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,344
Geopolitics

2541
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:51,232
So this is worried about the you know our relations with the rest of the world

2542
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,256
Be at China

2543
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,536
Russia

2544
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,328
These sorts of places

2545
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,376
Turns out Mark knows what

2546
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:03,520
What's going to happen with all three of those situation regarding Iran War yes it is happening

2547
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:08,640
They took troops out of Syria but left the Russians in charge on the ground there

2548
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:11,200
Naturally there are

2549
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,224
In this war

2550
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:15,040
Which is actually what I have been saying

2551
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:19,136
And other war with the wrong does Alita the war with China

2552
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,928
And the Russians will

2553
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,720
Side with us

2554
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:25,280
And there's more about this

2555
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:28,096
Prophecies

2556
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,120
Are greater prophecy

2557
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,728
Which

2558
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:39,104
She says it perfectly Illustrated

2559
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,688
Exactly how that conversation must have gone

2560
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:45,504
And then he picks up on context clues

2561
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:52,160
Yeah absolutely that's right that's my higher-ups

2562
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:55,744
Exactly what you said because you are right

2563
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:59,328
Amazing all of your sources are Justice

2564
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,096
Yeah

2565
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,632
So earlier

2566
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,424
We got some strong indication

2567
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,496
Weather

2568
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,520
The Pendragon

2569
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:09,312
Excluded

2570
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,848
People that's one thing they

2571
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,152
Not great

2572
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:18,272
Is sort of racial profiling of the clerk at Montgomery Ward

2573
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:21,856
Not great either and that's why this clip sounds

2574
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,392
Suspicious

2575
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:31,072
Sickle cell anemia reptilians are not compatible with this Gene and rule out any

2576
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:34,656
That code for genetic breathing

2577
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:37,216
Food or even sexual purposes

2578
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:39,520
Stop it not feed off the block

2579
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:42,592
Race and not gas specifically off

2580
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:44,896
Parts of the black race

2581
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:47,200
That have sickle cell anemia

2582
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:50,528
Mark you're a bad f****** dudes

2583
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:52,832
You know that other people get

2584
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:55,392
Sickle cell anemia right or sickle cell

2585
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,440
Disorders like it's not

2586
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,464
Uniquely

2587
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:02,304
African American

2588
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,632
It's not like people who

2589
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:07,424
They might as well be black Annie

2590
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:16,128
Mark gopal Mark Mark Mark Mark

2591
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:16,896

Mark Mark

2593

Mark

2594
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:27,392
Real growth

2595
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:30,208
Text Erin other

2596
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:32,256
Fitz's

2597
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,280
Different about them

2598
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,656
God

2599
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:39,936
Why

2600
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,704
Why

2601
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:45,568
You could just not because it's because he's racing

2602
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:47,360
He has a Jeep

2603
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:50,432
Heated feeling that people of different races are

2604
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:53,248
Wow he created

2605
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,528
Two space mythology

2606
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:55,296
All this stuff

2607
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,832
It's a very convenient

2608
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,368
To find some sort of in

2609
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,928
Inside your face mythology

2610
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,208
That justifies the race

2611
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:06,048
Feelings that you already have

2612
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:11,680
Very.

2613
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
Yeah

2614
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:16,032
So you wanted to know about the spiders

2615
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:17,824
Did they invent the AI

2616
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,872
No

2617
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:24,736
Next clip

2618
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,760
I think the

2619
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:26,784
Spiders might just

2620
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,928
I don't even really have any later

2621
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:35,488
Don't know

2622
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,768
For sure

2623
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:41,632
Is is crawling with Psych

2624
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:47,520
And there have been some reports

2625
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:49,824
In the northern United Kingdom

2626
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,592
But here

2627
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:52,896
Carrie has to say

2628
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,176
Here's what Darius say

2629
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:54,944
About that

2630
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,736
The situation with spiders

2631
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:58,528
Currently

2632
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
On the planet

2633
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:03,648
I asked him about Sardinia because recently I was

2634
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:07,232
Asked if I would lead a tour to Sardinia

2635
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:12,352
Because there are many ancient sites there and lots of evidence of reptilians

2636
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,144
Involvement

2637
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:19,520
However I told Mark that I have declined to go to Sardinia because it

2638
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,568
When I looked at it

2639
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,128
On a psychic intuitive level

2640
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,152
I saw

2641
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:27,968
There were tons of spider rings and Reps

2642
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:29,248
Aliens there

2643
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:35,904
And Mark said I was absolutely right he said he would even go there and his true

2644
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:38,464
Not only in the past but also now

2645
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,512
And my apologies

2646
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:42,816
To the people that live in Sardinia

2647
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:45,888
I think it's probably a very beautiful I like

2648
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:47,680
I've seen pictures of it

2649
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:51,520
And I do apologize for this information but

2650
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:56,128
What can you do

2651
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:03,296
Don't shoot the messenger so I've been yet

2652
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:10,976
I love that that is my favorite thing

2653
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:13,280
Search

2654
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:24,288
Wake up in my life

2655
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,312
OSHA

2656
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,872
Carrie just told me we were covered in spiders

2657
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:36,064
And that's based on the rest of

2658
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:41,696
Just for a comparison

2659
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:44,000
From what I understand

2660
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:46,816
Miles Johnston has a source that has told him

2661
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:49,376
Prepare a spider beings hiding out

2662
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:51,168
In

2663
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:53,216
Play area

2664
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,520
North England

2665
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:57,824
Call the Lake District

2666
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:01,408
And in the tunnels there so that is also

2667
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,944
Very disconcerting

2668
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:03,712
Formation

2669
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:04,736
It sure is

2670
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:05,760
Through living in the

2671
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:12,160
Spider

2672
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,232
Could be

2673
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,560
They do live in England

2674
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:22,656
Right but I think supplies

2675
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:25,472
That's not worth talking about that there are spiders places

2676
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,752
These are aliens

2677
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:36,736
So she apologized

2678
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:39,808
Note to be fair it doesn't it does seem to be

2679
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:43,392
Adjusting to follow from the way she talked about it

2680
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,416
In the UK

2681
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,952
That is a ton

2682
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:47,232
Inside

2683
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:49,792
Snowman

2684
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:52,352
I got nothing on that other than

2685
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,936
I'm sorry for everyone affected yet as well

2686
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:56,960
Sergenians

2687
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:57,728
Dude

2688
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,008
It's rough

2689
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,032
Play the top situation

2690
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:06,688
Absolutely

2691
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,456
You didn't know about

2692
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:12,576
Are you going to do

2693
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:14,368
So

2694
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,184
So Trump is a guy

2695
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:20,000
Marquez talks about him

2696
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:24,352
Mark has been kind of pro Trump in the past

2697
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,632
Yeah

2698
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:26,912
You still is surprised

2699
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:28,192
But this is

2700
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:29,984
Phrase wheel

2701
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:33,312
The Trump Administration

2702
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:38,176
They are the only ones fighting for us in the US at this time

2703
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:42,272
But there is something going on right now with that Administration

2704
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,832
Not say what that is

2705
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:50,208
Then once again I am going to apologize

2706
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:51,232
The people of Sardinia

2707
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:56,864
Something bad happening

2708
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,192
Qualify what you're talking about

2709
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,984
I'm going say something's up

2710
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:02,752
Thumbs up

2711
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:06,592
Now takes

2712
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,872
Turn in a Durex

2713
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,408
I could never have

2714
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:12,736
Why we do Project Camelot up is

2715
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:17,088
David

2716
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,368
But this isn't good

2717
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:20,160
Predicted

2718
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:22,720
I asked him if Kevin

2719
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:24,256
Stacy was set up

2720
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:29,632
Degrees is Kevin Spacey is being set up because of what he knows

2721
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:33,984
Demonstration of him yesterday ending her

2722
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,264
But also I will

2723
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,032
Wonder if it's just

2724
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:45,760
Cuz he was in

2725
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:48,832
Well that actually

2726
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:51,136
Any reason

2727
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:55,744
Not something that I've

2728
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,936
Well there's like a

2729
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:04,704
The denial is

2730
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:11,104
Stuff like that

2731
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,920
The version that I don't think I've ever heard

2732
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:20,320
I sure just like who gives a s***

2733
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:22,112
Anyone suggest that

2734
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:25,952
Too much

2735
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,976
If that's

2736
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:27,744
Crazy

2737
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,816
That's wild crazy to carries asking

2738
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,168
I do think it's just going to be a space in this

2739
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:36,960
I know that sounds like I'm choking

2740
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,872
Yeah it's a bit

2741
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:50,272
Like maybe this is an incidental things we've already talked about

2742
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:55,648
Which she just found out that Kevin Spacey is in trouble for so long to figure out the

2743
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:57,952
Spider-Man was bitten by a radioactive

2744
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,720
Spiders

2745
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:01,792
Red Sprites

2746
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:03,328
Yeah that's possible

2747
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,400
I don't know I don't know but you know what there's other news

2748
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:11,008
I'll be honest with you towards the end of this

2749
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:11,776
Really Zone

2750
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,432
Bitwit

2751
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:24,832
Exclude played I got like it was almost like I got jostled out of asleep or like someone threw a bucket of

2752
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,880
Cold water on my Facebook

2753
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:29,696
Throwback

2754
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,488
Did I hear that correctly

2755
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,280
The craziest

2756
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,304
Should I've ever heard

2757
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:37,120
There was a raptor wedding

2758
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:39,936
In late February around the 28th

2759
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:43,520
And Mark says this was a major wedding uniting

2760
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:48,896
Two major Raptor Family Lines Glenmark calls it a great

2761
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,176
Love story

2762
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:56,832
There's a raptor weather

2763
02:08:57,088 --> 02:09:02,208
There was a raptor wedding and bark is happy for the couple

2764
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:06,560
Why do rappers get married human concept

2765
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:10,912
Why do they get married monogamy is not necessarily a human

2766
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,960
Constructor

2767
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:13,984
In the wild

2768
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,336
But the formal ceremony of marriage is something

2769
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,616
Creative

2770
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:23,968
By the Raptor exactly

2771
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:25,248
Boom

2772
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,784
Turn it around

2773
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:29,344
How else are you going to allocate land

2774
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,112
To your face

2775
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,392
They live in

2776
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:33,440
Well

2777
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,256
Subspace

2778
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:41,376
I know I know you're like

2779
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:43,424
This is good stuff

2780
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:46,752
This is stupid doctors are in love

2781
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,544
What about spiders that do they get married

2782
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:56,480
What about the dog be

2783
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:01,088
No mayonnaise

2784
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,536
I just thought

2785
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:15,168
Contacts that is being an episode where we're talking about Kerry Cassidy running interference for a f******

2786
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:16,448
Murderer

2787
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,520
That's a delight

2788
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:25,152
There was a Rapture wedding

2789
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:34,624
Oh and here's an update on

2790
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,976
What does socialite news

2791
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:43,584
Ridiculous

2792
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:51,264
So we learned a little bit of the human celebrity news with Kevin

2793
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,592
Between two major Raptor families

2794
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:00,736
Back to humans

2795
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:01,504
Celebrity

2796
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,808
Because there was a

2797
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:06,112
No

2798
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:06,880
Celebrity world

2799
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:08,672
Not too long

2800
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,440
To know about it

2801
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:16,096
Regarding Jan-Michael Vincent the actor who was a close friend of Mark's and died of

2802
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:21,216
Alcoholism because he had seen too much what would too much and couldn't handle it

2803
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:25,056
What's Mark have the utmost respect for him and misses him

2804
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:31,200
Jan-Michael Vincent

2805
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:35,808
That is really one of those biscuits

2806
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:40,672
Yeah there's no Michael Vincent

2807
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:46,816
Uvula

2808
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,864
Yeah the Airwolf

2809
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,144
Sam's

2810
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,448
Maybe he just watched

2811
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:54,496
Or in prison

2812
02:11:57,568 --> 02:12:03,456
Current like you died on the 10th of February that's pretty close to Wyandotte

2813
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:05,760
Carrie was going to do this interview

2814
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,040
That really make sense

2815
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,856
About that being free

2816
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:15,744
Real cool

2817
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:21,632
Clip where Carrie she's giving her audience

2818
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,424
Advice that will work

2819
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,472
Against her best interest

2820
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:28,032
I want to thank you for watching

2821
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:31,872
And for listening and for supporting the work of Project Camelot

2822
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:35,200
Take care and please use discernment

2823
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:37,504
And to your own investigation

2824
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:40,320
Thank you and goodnight

2825
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:46,976
The idea of it are saying you should do your own research is only going to lead people to realize that

2826
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:48,512
She's full of s*** and doesn't know any

2827
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:50,816
So

2828
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:52,096
Against

2829
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,120
Telling people to research

2830
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,728
You don't want to be a truth-teller and a tree

2831
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,264
Peter kind of person to be like

2832
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:05,664
Don't worry about it worry about it we've all been there I got this covered

2833
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,040
Super weird

2834
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:12,064
Decarie decided to

2835
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:12,832
To even get in

2836
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:14,624
To any of the specific

2837
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,648
Of marks

2838
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,928
Because she has

2839
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:18,208
Such a poor grasp

2840
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,280
The details of the

2841
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:23,072
What's going on

2842
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:25,632
Circulates her interact

2843
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,680
Tamar so parallel

2844
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,728
Do that police interview

2845
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,008
It just like

2846
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:33,824
It opens up a can of worms where it really reveal

2847
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:35,616
Like how manipulative

2848
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:37,152
She is by him

2849
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:38,432
And how willing of

2850
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,200
Participants

2851
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,224
In that man if

2852
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:41,760
Along with him

2853
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,040
I just think it's

2854
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,576
The real stupid games

2855
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,880
It's a little

2856
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:47,648
It's a little

2857
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,184
Would like disconcerting

2858
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,720
Cuz it's almost like she's in a one-woman

2859
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:56,352
Colt 21

2860
02:13:56,608 --> 02:14:00,192
Yeah you are you are full on willing to do

2861
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:00,960
Anything

2862
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:03,776
Justify what it is that inside parks

2863
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:05,056
To her friend Simon parkes

2864
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:09,152
He's also in that calls as

2865
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,456
Three-person

2866
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,040
Because he I mean like even in the

2867
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,576
The trailer for that

2868
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:17,856
Is The Tech Guys make

2869
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:18,880
Km

2870
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,696
There you got some interviews

2871
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:22,976
The people who are in

2872
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:25,792
The UFO community

2873
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:27,584
It doesn't really great to service

2874
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:31,168
We're trying to actually look for people

2875
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:33,216
Go to just pass off

2876
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:37,312
Well you know I don't think

2877
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:39,872
I think there's a fair point

2878
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:46,528
Mainstreet

2879
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:48,576
Quote unquote

2880
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,344
Serious

2881
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,624
UFO

2882
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,160
Don't like Mark

2883
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:55,488
So yeah she is sort of in a world of her own

2884
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,512
Yeah

2885
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:57,280
And I think

2886
02:14:59,072 --> 02:14:59,840
Drawing attention

2887
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:00,864
Intuit makes

2888
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:02,144
Spurlock's so much

2889
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:03,936
So when she does.

2890
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,728
Look this is stupid

2891
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:08,800
You can only hide

2892
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:15,200
Persolog about him

2893
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:17,760
A lot of people are more people are aware

2894
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:18,528
Is Dory

2895
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:20,064
The fact that he's a f****** murderer

2896
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,600
And it's hilarious

2897
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,880
Date the factory

2898
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:25,184
He's transitioned into this guy's

2899
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:29,536
I know the Raptors they get married they take your chocolate they're fighting again

2900
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:31,328
Other beings

2901
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:32,608
Isn't that Beatles down

2902
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:35,936
About Stargate

2903
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,776
Funny on some level

2904
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:41,568
When you when you

2905
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:42,592
Uncoupling

2906
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:44,128
From the fact that he is

2907
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,408
The kind of guy

2908
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:47,200
Who would manipulate a seventeen-year-old

2909
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,224
Murdering

2910
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,248
A guy who was in his

2911
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,016
His wedding

2912
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:51,552
And tell him

2913
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,576
Finish the job

2914
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:54,112
With a screwdriver

2915
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:58,464
You forget about that part hilarious

2916
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:00,512
You keep that part in

2917
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:03,840
Very upsetting

2918
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:06,656
Yeah there is a certain amount of

2919
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:08,192
Parallel here with

2920
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,728
Aj2 in that

2921
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,520
It's like

2922
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:18,176
Indict

2923
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:19,968
Because of the

2924
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:20,992
Popularity

2925
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,784
Like she's running this

2926
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:25,856
And the goal really for these types of scams

2927
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:26,624
Is to keep them

2928
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,160
Contain

2929
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,440
It starts getting out

2930
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:31,232
And you start getting attention

2931
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:42,240
Trying to actually

2932
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:44,032
Scary

2933
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:47,616
Bradley's not on the level

2934
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:49,408
Necessarily

2935
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:52,224
Responsible for the overexposure of

2936
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,016
Mark know I absolutely

2937
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:56,832
She is

2938
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:59,648
I think it's just a natural thing that's going to come out

2939
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,416
Awesome

2940
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:03,744
You don't like the idea of

2941
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,536
As long as a

2942
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,304
A couple

2943
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:09,376
People start talking about like the idea that there's

2944
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,144
This guy

2945
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:11,680
Who got these

2946
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,960
Kids who work for

2947
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,240
Murderer guy

2948
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,520
Then he went to prison

2949
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,288
Started

2950
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:17,312
Career in Santa

2951
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:20,128
Are you presenting at

2952
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:24,736
Is real right

2953
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:28,064
Lasers that we're going to destroy Bridges nights

2954
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,856
Service Roundtable

2955
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:31,904
Too good of a story for people

2956
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:36,000
Like enjoy or look into

2957
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,792
So you reach a critical mass

2958
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:39,584
Once enough people are looking

2959
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,352
The story

2960
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,376
That like

2961
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:43,424
It's almost

2962
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,472
Destined to blow up if you're trying to 4

2963
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:55,968
Flix with way less interesting stories than this and you were still like

2964
02:17:56,224 --> 02:18:01,344
The staircase before I turned it off

2965
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:03,904
This is not the time to litigate this

2966
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:07,488
Amazing series

2967
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,280
This guy is doing

2968
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,072
Probably

2969
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:12,352
What will be animes

2970
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:14,144
About this

2971
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:15,424
The story

2972
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,192
A part of the

2973
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:18,496
The story now is Victor

2974
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:19,264
Is

2975
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:21,312
A victim of March

2976
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:22,336
Ovulation

2977
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:23,872
Willingly

2978
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:25,152
And

2979
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:25,920
Also

2980
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:27,712
Defense

2981
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:33,344
I didn't forgot

2982
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,136
Nearly within the scope of what I

2983
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:35,904
I could do

2984
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,952
Hey we need we need

2985
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:41,536
We could call call Larry

2986
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:46,144
We wouldn't be able to know the name of the

2987
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:50,496
What's not really mean

2988
02:18:56,128 --> 02:19:00,736
Do we need to pay back over Patriots

2989
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:04,064
Yeah everybody listen your knowledge by right now

2990
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,600
Really go to the patreon we need

2991
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:12,000
$2,500 by tomorrow because otherwise

2992
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:18,400
Black

2993
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:19,936
Very dumb

2994
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:21,984
Learn that we've now

2995
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,032
But we did learn about repatriation

2996
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:26,080
Alonzo

2997
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:28,384
More of a

2998
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,200
This is dumb in more of a concentrated

2999
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:31,968
Evil

3000
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:38,880
Very hard with her

3001
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:42,464
Hasn't read that interview with the

3002
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:46,048
Detective he hasn't looked at the court records or anything like that

3003
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:47,584
But he's pretending that she did

3004
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:50,144
Eva Lin

3005
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,168
Negligent

3006
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,448
But I don't

3007
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,472
I think the cheese

3008
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:54,240
Nearly pure

3009
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,008
Pretending

3010
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:56,800
But she has this information

3011
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:58,592
Right

3012
02:19:58,848 --> 02:19:59,360
Information

3013
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,128
You still believe

3014
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:02,688
Fuckingawesome

3015
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,736
But I still think

3016
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,016
But she's blocking about what you say

3017
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:07,040
You think so

3018
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,160
Read all that

3019
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:14,976
And just dismiss it as

3020
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:16,768
I don't you read the 131

3021
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,304
If you read that

3022
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:20,352
Cannot imagine for a second

3023
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,120
But he's not a

3024
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:22,912
I don't think she ready

3025
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:23,680
But

3026
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:25,984
I wouldn't be surprised if she dismissed all of this

3027
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,520
All of the court records

3028
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,288
Lesbian

3029
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:32,640
Just a railroad job and worry about it

3030
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:34,176
I mean rap

3031
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:35,968
Spock

3032
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:36,736
Because your defense

3033
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:38,784
Murderer without having evidence

3034
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:40,832
Yeah

3035
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:50,816

You started a Twitter and I got rid of

3037
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:59,264
Almost

3038
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,032
Really close to the

3039
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,056
The same tires

3040
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:03,872
We are and we're on

3041
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:07,456

02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:10,016
Step bro

Tribology.

3044

3045
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:17,696
That guy didn't

3046
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:20,000
Yeah he was involved in

3047
02:21:20,256 --> 02:21:22,560
The Palazzo

3048
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:26,912
We all know that he doesn't like shopping Amsterdam that's true

3049
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:41,248
Are you looking up whether or not Peter Falk killed someone

3050
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:48,672
The good people of Sardinia

3051
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:52,768
Most of them I mean I'm sure some sardinians if 12 people play

3052
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:55,072
Most of the population

3053
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:03,776
Technically not probably absolutely nobody

3054
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:07,104
Holding

3055
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:12,736
