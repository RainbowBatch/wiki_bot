Come upon Our Land

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
The plague that is

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,040
Popularization of Alex Jones

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,952
That was that was really defeatist I'm in I'm in a grim place

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
We will come to realize why throughout the course of this episode

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
Clearwater

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,984
There's problems

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
That's really problematic and terrifying

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,248
2/3

12
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,088
The inevitability of climate change

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,624
An infinite amount of

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,696
Gigi's smoke creeping nationalistic fervor and putting us

15
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,280
Nope that's not why

16
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
Like I said I don't want one

17
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,520
No it's because of what the trend

18
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
We're going to be looking at in this episode of the show

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
I watch Alex Jones

00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552

April 4th April 14th

28

But as is our tradition

29
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,088
Here is an out-of-context drop of Alex Jones

30
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Songs from that show

31
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
We don't either

32
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
If no idea

33
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,920
This actually this this episode actually has like

6

36
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
Candidates for out-of-context drop along the way

37
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,696
Tapestry

38
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720

April 14th

41
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes I noticed a trend and that is the most

42
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Of the week

43
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
Is boring as s***

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
Eman Alex Goes balls out at the end of the week

00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Sunday is where he says things that you shouldn't say he said he like

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040

Kind of like

52
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Let's introduce the narrative

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328

54
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,704
Absolutely

00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,360
Send them to Abu Dhabi

56
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,504
How do you thicken rogerstone off the table

57
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:39,904

59
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
So

60
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
This week

61
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
It was pretty boring

62
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
No

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Exciting

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,408
April 11th show from from Tuesday

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
So that was kind of

66
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,760
Interesting this week but that was just because I was having a little bit of a breakdown

67
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
Yeah and that was

68
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Waco

69
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,303
It is just this boring stuff it's like

70
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Siri

00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
Syria's Ally

72
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,959
Dropping the Moab

73
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,295
Well apparently from a mile out it explodes

74
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,463
Don't get close to the mother of all Bob Butts

75
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
The most beef

76
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
So on Friday

77
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095

A cover of

81
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Purple

82
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:23,839
Okay what time

Some country should 22 means he's in a weird place

85
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Come out

86
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
So on Friday at the end

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Login

89
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
Deflecting a little bit from him having to carry too much of the weight

90
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
For most of the show yet Mike cernovich on

91
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Okay who is Mike cernovich

92
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Mike cernovich

93
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
That is a great question

94
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Is grape okay alright that's the long and short of it

95
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,799
He's been a friend weirdo he does a lot of periscopes

96
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
He was really into the

97
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
The TV show

98
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
He is a journalist he loved the movie Down Periscope I'm putting journalists in heavy

99
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Pierre quotes

100
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
Suspect

101
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Contingent

102
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
In the White House is leaking information to

103
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,095
Suspiciously is he the one where Trump was like he should get a Pulitzer

104
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,239
Jeff broke broke the Susan Rice

105
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:39,871
Trump says you deserve

106
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,855
It's not super interesting but sticks around

107
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
That works great

108
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
I can't remember most beautiful

109
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Fourth wall break

110
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,199

111
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
I would love by the alt right

00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
Be a great housewife is all I'm

113
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
Alright at knowledge underscore

114
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
She's too uppity

115
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,959
She's out there talking about semitism

116
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:45,663
You took that to real I did as foreshadowing

117
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
Mike cernovich is on for quite a while and then the third hour they bringing Gavin or Nigel McGuinness

118
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
Oops Tavis

119
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
The rest of this episode as a show of disrespect

120
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
But his name is Gavin

121
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Sound Advice

122
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Iowa

123
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
They Trot around is like

124
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Some sort of amazing

125
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Credit Insurance

126
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
I mean

127
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Come on now

128
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
I don't actually know anything about

129
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,223
I don't know anything about the inner workings of it but I've read a lot of articles

130
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
And it seems like

131
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
People who has an olive

132
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
What's their in-house editorial

133
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
I think it's

134
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Like incompetent

135
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Hana Restaurant

136
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
But kind of how I would describe a lot of their journalism

137
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Okay I understand

138
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,519
Does he bumble around to shooting is gonzo

139
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
It's done on it but by and large it's like

140
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
Very young people who are much

141
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
It's Jack

142
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
A tripod

143
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Bulshit

144
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Oh s***

145
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
And

146
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Dannon

147
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Return

148
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
That is what we're going to be

149
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
Discussing when do you three men map

150
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
Alex Jones Show

151
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Comes out of their mouth

152
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
They're all the same

153
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
We Human Centipede

154
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,647
We were starting to show I was telling you that I'm in a little bit of a weird state

155
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
Yes this is why

156
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
I think

157
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
That they're consolidate

158
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
Now

159
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,423
The vice people are going to absorb

160
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,567
We just f****** hilarious

161
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
More life

162
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Born Gavin

163
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Mike cernovich and Alex Jones

164
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
Thoroughly

165
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
Emerging in terms of their businesses merging

166
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
But it is sort of like

167
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
A rogue's gallery coming together to our Batman

168
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
Are Batman

169
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Looks like a team coming together

170
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
And it's really f****** scary

171
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
Cuz this idea of the propaganda

172
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
Just working together

173
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Create

174
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Unlimited potential of audiences

175
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Emerging

176
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
You know it's the same thing with Alec being on Joe Rogan and not being challenged

177
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
His ideas

178
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
It's that same sort of thing

179
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
Consolidated Echo chamber where they

180
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Can each repeat back

181
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
The b*******

182
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
But not completely

183
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Olive

184
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
Vanderbilt incredibility understand their audio

185
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
So they give Alex Jones by proxy credibility

186
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Likes proxy credibility

187
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
It becomes a really dangerous

188
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
So

189
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
And I don't like what it's worth

190
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,183
Good news

191
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,303
No tunnels

192
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
These people are f****** released

193
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
So it will be easy for us to

194
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
To cut through a lot of their bulshit

195
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
But

196
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
It's still scary that they're amassing hordes

197
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
Follow them and combining

198
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
It's around in Skyrim

199
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Now let's get

200
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
The first one

201
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Is maybe the most delicious of them

202
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
I like calling clips

203
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Tell me more

204
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Delicious

205
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Especially when they start

206
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
And

207
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
Look look at Czar Nicholas or

208
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
What was Edward the 8th father's name Gavin McGinnis you don't think he has a lemon chasing around 8

209
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
Every part of me

210
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
That happening

211
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
You know like that

212
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
I would totally be gay with you

213
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:36,479
As long as Irish Guinness has a novelty facial hair that would cause Alex Jones to

214
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,319
To scream for 20 minutes if it was on the CNN reporter

215
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,671
Beard and mustache that's a little too long for the length of beard

216
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,767
So you have a little bit of like prop mustache going on with his beard

217
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
To the point where the guy that he screamed

218
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,959
Mr. creepy mr. creepy over here on CNN

219
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Not the same but

220
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
It's enough that if

221
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
He was someone who Alex was against kyuubi like probably does

222
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
Tax records

223
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
He's on his side

224
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
He wants to f***

225
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
So that means

226
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
Secretly wants to

227
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Tupac the guy on

228
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,839
Perfect

229
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,727
Betrayed

230
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
Now we get to the beginning of this

231
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
Conversation that they're all having a

232
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Again I'm doing this purpose

233
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
I know his name

234
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Nigel McGuinness comes in

235
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
With

236
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,575
He's really on evolve to take

237
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
And hack

238
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Comedy

239
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
About gay

240
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
Yeah

241
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,375
I remember the eighties to I remember Adam Carolla in 96

242
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,263
Verbatim that bit

243
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
If it weren't for the sex

244
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
It's just hanging out with you

245
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
Your friends like that's from

246
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
The Larry the Cable Guy

247
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,415
White Collar Comedy Blue Collar Comedy

248
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Yeah yeah

249
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
Absolutely

250
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,703
Like Zacchaeus lamest things and Alex's are sponsored

251
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
Fake laugh

252
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Glass that he does throughout this

253
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
It's crazy

254
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
But then also

255
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
It's

256
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
Productive in this idea that gay couples don't fight

257
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:50,879
It's really insulting the idea of a assuming that

258
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Gay people art

259
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Real people

260
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Just some sort of magic

261
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
No

262
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Get along all the time

263
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,631
Assuming that homosexual relationships

264
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,935
Are identical to platonic friendship

265
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
I think they are

266
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
Yeah and I think that's exactly what Alex

267
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
I know that he's

268
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Knifeworks

269
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,623
I don't remember which is my whims

270
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
He is coming at I know that he's doing this for humor

271
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,559
Which is not doing a good job

272
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:35,423
One of the happiest if you want

273
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
Horribly reductive and insult

274
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Yes

275
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,847
Cereal we're not just going to laugh at any bulshit

276
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
Yeah congratulations on failing

277
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
My man

278
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
My bro my bro

279
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
You failed us both Gavin and

280
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,159
Make some predictions about what's going to be happening over the weekend

281
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
In Berkeley

282
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
Lauren Southern

283
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Home Depot

284
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:21,503
Bikers old keepers

285
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
English

286
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
Extinguish

287
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
How'd you do

288
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Extinguisher

289
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,935
Minutes the softest area that's most attackable probably that would kill you

290
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,335
You're not going through the chest cavity with flagpole

291
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,943
I'm at the light of life

292
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,527
English

293
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,087
But he said there was nothing controversial going

294
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
So why would they get those life

295
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:04,767
That's crazy right

296
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Celebrating free speech

297
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,375
In a way that I'm sure does not curtail the right

298
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,215
Nobody going to Home Depot

299
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
Torious Lee violent

300
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Trust fund children

301
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,735
I every time I go outside I just see yet another trust fund child

302
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Take this

303
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,207
This is McGinnis coming home

304
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
First of all

305
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
Reportage

306
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,447
You just never reporter at the Home Depot all or did you pick up migrant workers

307
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
Articles

308
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
I don't know

309
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Can you

310
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:59,039
Keep us posted if any well-to-do kids are buying the weird things

311
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,695
To come to this conclusion over and over again that McGinnis is

312
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
I'm just popping up

313
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,815
And giving these anecdotal stories that I don't know how he

314
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,447
Could know anybody if he doesn't know don't mean anything but he uses it to prop up his stories

315
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
And it's b*******

316
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
This is why Rappaport

317
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
H

318
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,711
Home Depot bushes right now

319
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
Where do you think he knows all these Scoops you're making a really great argument here because I should say that John Rappaport wasn't on

320
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
On assignment

321
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
There's almost no doubt about it

322
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Any definitely

323
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Take that picture

324
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
Is going to be trouble

325
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
If it's Patriots

326
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
March on Saturday

327
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
What I understand a little bit

328
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
The afternoon

329
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
Everyone I understand there's a little bit of attention

330
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
Little bit uneasy

331
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,967
I imagine there are going to

332
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
B fight

333
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
The Breakout

334
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
Disagree with him at all there's going to be

335
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
In trouble

336
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
The okay

337
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Hardcore

338
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Keep off

339
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,631
But you know how this goes with that Milo situation there were agent provocateurs in the crowd

340
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
Who are largely working with alright organization

341
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
Some of them even employed

342
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Directly

343
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Buy them

344
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,431
Because

345
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
I don't want to use the same

346
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Sort of argument that they use erroneous

347
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
I don't

348
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Problem

349
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
But I don't

350
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Exactly

351
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
They say is

352
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
8

353
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
Insanely

354
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Ahead of us

355
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Then anytime

356
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
A protest protest

357
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Now it's a defensive

358
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
It's so

359
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
Angry

360
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
Seems like we're being outsmarted

361
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Not super Proactiv

362
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Like if we could do this show everyday

363
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
And really analyze things

364
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Maybe we could

365
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
Do not get ahead of the 8-ball somewhat

366
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
We have job

367
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
We live our lives

368
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Paid protesters

369
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
There you go there's a protest

370
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
We're just we're just outsmarted the argument

371
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Who's there

372
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
Paid protesters

373
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
Just Gallimore

374
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,039
You know what it is

375
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
Pizza pair

376
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
Beats three-of-a-kind

377
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
Yelling the whole bunch beets

378
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,303
Game of Poker that we're playing

379
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,143
Anyway

380
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Apparel

381
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
Yeah be nice

382
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
Anyway

383
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
Here's Mike cernovich coming in

384
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
Choose between

385
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
Berkeley

386
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,744
What episode

387
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
The choice to not do that

388
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Thing that might hurt

389
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
I predict he actually asked Alex if he could come into Studio

390
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,848
Enable f****** up

391
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
Some guy in a black ski mask

392
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,112
Is going to come up punch the s*** out of me

393
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,720
Spencer all over again

394
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
But I am saying that every time I see

395
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
See the gif

396
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Richard Spencer

397
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
I groped my heart grows

398
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Three sizes

399
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
No it stops

400
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
I wish I could be there covering

401
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,528
Completely

402
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,368
But it's great to have that convenient

403
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
I could be there

404
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
The guy at the bar saying like holy back

405
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,584
And just grabbing onto his friends at the bar who's like

406
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,680
I could have made it I could have been in the show

407
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
You know just

408
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
Thumb something happened

409
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
I got fat

410
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
I got fat and turned out that didn't help I was trying to protect the woman in a bar fight otherwise I'll be playing probe

411
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Ball but I'm a hero

412
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,552
No that's okay

413
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:53,184
Going in covering this place

414
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
Or I could go to Alex

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
And be treated like a hero in an air-conditioned Studio

416
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
I'm going to go with that one

417
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Yeah that's

418
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
So pretty

419
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
That's pretty easy

420
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
Cernovich has take on it now Gavin has some some other thoughts that are a little bit

421
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,944
They're all rich kids are sons of professors

422
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,040
Losers With No Parental Guidance

423
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,440
Any forces are going out there and you can tell when you see

424
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,840
Funny thing they do is they putting women in the front line

425
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Any guy

426
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
For the inauguration

427
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
When will Robert

428
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,904
This one

429
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:01,280
Just said that he started beating women having to push them off

430
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,632
Yeah I know that didn't happen for a number of reasons

431
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,984
Forest it didn't it didn't happen is that there's no video

432
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,800
Everything is out there

433
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,360
There's a video of him embarrassingly drunk

434
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
From that

435
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
The woman's March MP3

436
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Also

437
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:29,184
They're putting the women out front it was in DC was the f****** women's March

438
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
All of those women together

439
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,240
Only with the permission of

440
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:49,408
The most feminists you might actually be pretty close to what McGinnis

441
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Thanks

442
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Of course it's what they say

443
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Especially

444
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
Steve of a world where women are on

445
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Especially McKenna

446
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
Menu

447
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,928
Evil masculine Force

448
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
And we're going to get to it

449
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
But like

450
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
I really

451
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,584
Really resent the idea that they're they're sort of

452
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
Presenting it as

453
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,216
What is a put

454
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Front is human shield

455
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Where I

456
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
The reality is

457
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
That

458
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,640
A lot of liberal causes women are leading

459
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,456
And we're comfortable

460
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
And we're super comfortable with that

461
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,576
I am supporting

462
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:34,464
Causes that women I'm not afraid of female leadership

463
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Masculinity

464
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
You can't believe

465
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
Because that starts

466
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
If women

467
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
Can actually

468
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Leave these March

469
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Without

470
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Other

471
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Without the

472
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
Right even if

473
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,968
That they have to spend the narrative otherwise their brain

474
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
Like whoa

475
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:04,160
Riches

476
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,488
Decisions for themselves

477
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,840
Probably

478
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
That doesn't make any goddamn sense

479
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,216
Speaking of Gavin McGinnis his mind he has

480
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
Quote when they're talking about this idea

481
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
Cussing liberals attacking them having to fight them off

482
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,200
Which is going to take us down a very fun Road

483
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:41,792
What is the matter with you

484
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
Now

485
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
Jordan Jordan

486
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
Do you know what the proud boys are

487
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
No

488
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:01,248
I don't know I'm not sure those words next to each other

489
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
What metal band

490
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,880
It was a song from musical Aladdin

491
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Be proud of your boy

492
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
That's what it comes from

493
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,072
I think that's what it comes come from

494
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,888
The proud boys

495
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,216
Masculine group of people that this guy knows

496
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Name

497
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
From The Aladdin music

498
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,336
From what I understand

499
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,152
That's like how the KKK has

500
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Dragon

501
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
What are you doing

502
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Now

503
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
You can be this

504
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Childish

505
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
Looking filled with delight and

506
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
And turn it into such

507
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
We're going to talk about a bunch about the proud boys now

508
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
The proud boys

509
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
Are an organization

510
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
I don't know I haven't listened

511
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:01,152
The proud boys are an organization

512
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
That is basically

513
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
From what I can tell

514
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
A really awful fraternity

515
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Really

516
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Awful man

517
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
How they put out a video

518
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Is Matt

519
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Just a regular

520
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
They put out a video

521
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
That I'm going to play part of

522
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,144
I want I want you to listen carefully

523
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Gavin put this video out

524
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
Alright

525
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,592
Some of them are in their 40s

526
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
Summer the authorities

527
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,016
Alright if anyone ever says like that kids in his parents basement

528
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,088
40 year old boy

529
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Playing at children

530
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
It's worse than you think

531
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,024
Of course it is now listen to this this is the beginning of their Sizzle reel

532
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,168
That they put on YouTube

533
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,800
They're probably looking to do that right I might watch it I mean I watch the Bad Girls Club

534
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:07,200
There's no end to what I would watching television everybody watch The Proud boys

535
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
Become consumed

536
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
And I'm confident

537
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
What no

538
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
How much you play time of your life

539
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Giant pussies

540
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
F*** it

541
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Price

542
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
You know

543
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
And the West is under siege

544
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
Shelter us from fry

545
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Paying for it

546
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,952
This is a shity Zach Braff

547
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,000
From Scrubs

548
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,816
Overlays

549
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
Horrendous overlays

550
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
I'm playing with his baby

551
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
And stuff like that

552
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Give it a break

553
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
So

554
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
Give it a rest

555
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,576
Just take a sip of the wine and just enjoy the rest of this important to show how much of an idiot this guy

556
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Alright and what kind of

557
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,416
Crazy masculine Messiah complex

558
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
That's insane

559
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
Actual tenets where we have to

560
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,072
Restitution for our sins

561
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
I really want is for everyone to stop

562
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,960
Crying about the winners

563
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:43,456
Cologne

564
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:48,832
Quitting masturbating

565
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
And quitting p***

566
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
Call Ash Dad no way

567
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,512
Prison

568
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,584
Give everyone a gun

569
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,912
And Welfare close the borders

570
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,312
Recognize

571
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
Shutdown

572
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,968
We all want

573
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,528
We all want to get better

574
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064

It's necessary

584
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
Imagine

585
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,576
Imagine a world

586
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,976
You know how much better my life with your life

587
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Joyous

589
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
Salvadoran rigano

590
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Look at it

591
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,496
Look at the darkness Jordan

592
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,312
Don't deny the darkness

593
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
That are deal breakers

594
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
It's for me

595
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Don't fuc

596
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Quit my job

597
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
Don't f*** with my dog tootles

598
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
And don't fuc

599
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
My Little Pony app

600
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
VIP

601
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
The beginning about a week

602
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm a proud boy

603
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
And I'm proud

604
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
What's My Little Pony

605
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,728
People who want to be left alone in the

606
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Who won't leave them

607
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
How about the people who want f****** roads

608
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
How do you outlaw

609
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,648
Without some sort of authority

610
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,536
Government

611
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,728
Also how vague is venerate the housewife

612
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,224
Mother up on the goddamn abroad have a job

613
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,272
It's not that she doesn't have a job

614
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
I hate I hate

615
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,648
Condom

616
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,744
Is a complete and utter nonsense

617
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
F****** punch

618
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
In the face

619
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,840
A Milli

620
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
Hold on calm down we got to get to this next clip which sort of

621
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:52,896
Nigel McGuinness philosophy

622
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,968
What do you like to seeing as you've pointed out

623
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:02,112
There's there's no way for him to do the things that he wants to do I within his own

624
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,256
Don't have a sense of what these proud boys are

625
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
So now we got to take a look at that

626
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:15,424
I'm not going to use any of the words that I have

627
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Proud boys

628
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Would you like me no

629
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Listen

630
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:25,408
Adjectives this video explains a little bit

631
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
Focusing on this game and having meet up

632
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,296
F****** secret handshakes

633
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,368
Yeah initiation game

634
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
No he's saying let's beat the

635
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
The s*** out of each other

636
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:49,216
He just wants a Fight Club he wants to jerk himself off of pilani

637
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,520
That's basically what's going on here

638
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,336
So not that point of the video it goes to show

639
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
It's

640
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
I looked into a bunch of

641
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
I like I looked into the poison I was like what's going on

642
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
I found a ton of videos

643
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
Of their initiation ceremony

644
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,184
I wish you would have

645
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
No

646
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Pulling up

647
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,048
Here's the audio of one of them

648
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,400
It begins with the proud boys pledge

649
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Because people need to hear this

650
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,544
I am a western chauvinist

651
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:31,200
Apologize for creating

652
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,040
Pottermore

653
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,624
So you heard that there was a modern

654
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
Western chauvinist

655
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
Who refuses to apologize

656
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
For having created the modern world

657
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
Which is f****** horrible

658
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,400
A proud boy

659
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,288
You're hearing some slaps

660
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,688
And that is their initiation ceremony which is everybody gets around the initiate and they all just pain

661
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Pontius

662
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,464
Like really good

663
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
Are the guys just started laughing

664
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,656
Haha and here we got pulled up please

665
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Cool.

666
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
You were so Furious

667
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:46,208
Reddit

668
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,864
So whenever they're getting potties

669
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
The only set of fox the only one Twitter

670
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
Everyone's afraid

671
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,752
The only bright

672
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,312
Who tickle each other and f******

673
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
What is what

674
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
F****** is that

675
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
The f*** is that

676
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,064
Rage

677
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:18,720
Watching angry about every single moment of my life is now

678
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Pain forever

679
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
People who run the world

680
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
No

681
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
No let me go

682
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
This is my advice

683
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
To Every Woman

684
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Kill all men

685
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
Put more money into genetic

686
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
And just f******

687
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Move on without

688
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,136
You guys will be fine cuz there's a segment of the population that's in toothpaste

689
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,464
I feel like I need to fully explain what's going on

690
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,304
So there's this dude to explain what's going on

691
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,400
Punching him into the group they're all just punching

692
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
Jerking

693
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,032
The only the only way for it to

694
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Then wait for the punching to stop

695
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
Is for the initiate

696
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,712
To name five things in a certain category that someone yells out

697
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,760
So in that instance it was cereal

698
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,600
Yeah and he was yelling out the names of cereals

699
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,536
Circle of Death

700
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,584
Play in college

701
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
Category time

702
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
Note to just recording from the movie

703
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
Ariel

704
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,688
Totally real video video

705
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
Do not act like this in real life

706
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,832
The video that I just played you were the guys listening all cereals and getting slapped

707
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,928
At the end of it there's a title card that says video produced by Gavin McInnes

708
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,464
This is directly from him

709
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Here's the other thing

710
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,328
I found a bunch of other initiation videos

711
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
At one of them

712
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
It's so f****** funny

713
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
Cuz they're like

714
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
I can't remember what the five the category

715
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
But he's like naming them

716
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
And then some guy accidentally punches him in the face

717
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,488
Biodomes for these f******

718
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,888
How worthless pile of human garbage to masculinity

719
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,704
Punched in the face like that's the worst thing that could possibly happen

720
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,312
You don't know these body shops to prove that you're a man and one guy punches you in the face

721
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Yes

722
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
It's not for your face so beautiful

723
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:53,344
I hate all these old men reclaiming their masculinity

724
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Peppa

725
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,256
The theater of Western show

726
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,632
Yeah

727
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
Done

728
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
0

729
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
You know what

730
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,688
I dunno what the only way this makes sense

731
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
Is this

732
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,552
Is if white people were genetically engineered

733
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
It's totally possible

734
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,208
You understand

735
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
This is what

736
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
Nigel McGuinness is all about

737
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
This is his group

738
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Pictures

739
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Horrendous

740
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
It's somewhere

741
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:45,312
Somewhere between a drum a dumb drunk pussyfoot

742
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Fraternity

743
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
And Fight Club

744
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
It's somewhere in the middle of an ambivalent Fight Club

745
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
4 dudes who filled dispossessed

746
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,552
I'm feel like they don't have any masculinity

747
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
Walking Among Us

748
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
The proud boys

749
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
If I find a proud boy tattoo

750
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
I am going to

751
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
BP on that tattoo

752
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
Ariel

753
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,824
A human being yourself

754
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
Or at our Gmail

755
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Number of words

756
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,368
Like

757
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,000
I hate to seem like a lot of really repressed homosexuality to

758
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,304
They're always without shirts on and s***

759
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
There's nothing wrong with the

760
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
No not at all

761
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
As we all know

762
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,824
Doesn't get stronger than them know super homoerotic

763
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,711
I don't know wrestled or something but they were the f****** proud boys

764
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
They're so proud

765
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
Proud boys

766
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,111
What does even a specialized mean

767
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,415
Call yourself the f****** butter

768
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,743
Butterscotch or whatever the f***

769
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,327
But wouldn't it be better if I mean in terms of their brain

770
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
Did you listen to any of this ship

771
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
That is

772
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,983
Subconscious reality hitting

773
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
This is what

774
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,223
The Little Rascals

775
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
I mean they are prank Suresh

776
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Certainly

777
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Yeah

778
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,671
It's so f****** funny

779
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
But it isn't funny because

780
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
One of them is going to

781
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
Beat our asses

782
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:47,423
Murders people for whatever the f***

783
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,799
End result of This Is Us

784
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:57,663
But even if I do get my ass kicked by a proud boy I still think they're f****** hilarious

785
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Pride proud

786
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
I have no doubt

787
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,111
Based on that

788
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,439
That they will feel very guilty and turn themselves

789
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Because they are Jaya

790
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,095
Also I want to say that we're done talking about the proud boys for now

791
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,959
That we needed to discuss that just to give a sense of who's this McGinnis character is as

792
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,799
But as this develops as the rest of the season

793
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
Yeah

794
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,663
You don't have a full understanding of the sky

795
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
I have

796
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
This is that

797
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
Do you know what

798
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
Watching homoerotic

799
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,743
It seems like you thrilled by it

800
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,535
Another out-of-context drop from Alex

801
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Machine

802
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
They call him to Mean Machine

803
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,055
The meme machine

804
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
God how is that even worse than what you just said

805
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:04,735
Toenail

806
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
Anyway

807
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
No

808
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,903
No one also calls him Maurice

809
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,999
Bora Bora

810
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,583
Where we left off in the episode was

811
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
McGinnis talk

812
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
Alex

813
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,335
Alex has some thoughts about how liberal

814
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,303
Onset arthritis

815
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
As we all know that.

816
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,983
That's how I punch also but that's cuz I have a mild related to

817
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Oh really

818
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
So I mean

819
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
I'm sorry

820
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
I think it's mine

821
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,223
Gavin wants to

822
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Discuss why people keep attacking him

823
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Have you ever see why is

824
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
What

825
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
But you understand why I

826
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,303
Have you people ever seen an adult

827
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
And then I

828
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:29,471
Punch hard are you a f****** Cro-Magnon Arc adult that's what they

829
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
I think they are

830
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,311
They think they're the ones we're adults and we are children

831
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
That's awesome

832
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
That's amazing

833
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Anyway

834
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
Gavin wants to talk a little bit

835
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
About why he thinks

836
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
And I

837
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
I got to say

838
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
He's kind of right

839
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Axalta wrong

840
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,399
Nazis or whatever the hell we are

841
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,727
Killing a baby

842
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Trump

843
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
Everyone in front of me

844
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,391
I mean that's kind of ferrets

845
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
I just have this

846
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Cheyenne

847
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
Boehner fantasy

848
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Punching somebody

849
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
And being Justice

850
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,607
More like all they want

851
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
Is to be justified in

852
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
Because they have so much

853
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
Repressed

854
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
Rage

855
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:41,919
Useful when I was in Middle School in junior high I wanted to be in a street fight

856
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:45,759
Really like a big

857
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
Like group

858
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
And I don't want

859
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
So it's interesting

860
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,463
You know I just have these sort of

861
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:00,863
You know benchmarks in our own lives that we've grown through the kind of relate to how the proud boys at now

862
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,239
Like Poor Boys weenie

863
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,567
I want it I want to talk to about this

864
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,407
I think he's right

865
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,783
Though about this idea that people saying that he's a Nazi

866
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Allow them

867
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
To be able to attack him

868
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
I want to say this

869
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,047
When we talk about people like Sebastian

870
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,143
He's actually a Nazi

871
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Your Napolis

872
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
He has

873
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,263
Flight attendant really a Nazi

874
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,895
Fraxel that's fine

875
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,199
When were talking about someone like Gavin McInnes

876
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
Mike cernovich

877
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,271
Or even Alex Jones

878
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
They're not Nazis

879
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,367
People make those comparisons

880
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
What they are

881
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,695
It's still someone that needs

882
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,375
Yes the whole point of that was push for the right

883
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,007
Is it everyone's comparing them to Nazis to make it okay to punch them and I agree that that stupid

884
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,127
Go ahead punch

885
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:21,247
You know what I feel like that's a good point

886
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
As opposed to

887
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,671
Bingo

888
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,975
Bingo

889
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,559
And really get into usually like page 87

890
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
Exactly

891
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
So now

892
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,983
We're going to take a shifter

893
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,031
It's the three of them talking

894
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,615
I meant at the end cernovich disappears and it's just Alex

895
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
And

896
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
McGinnis

897
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
But for now

898
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
For now

899
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,063
Mike cernovich is going to pop back up and I'm going

900
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
To bust his bubble

901
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:05,023
Are you really working for

902
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,591
American traders he's useful

903
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
Kill you

904
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,111
What is going on with Trump

905
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,159
I get the missile attack

906
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,487
I just say I do

907
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
They caught before

908
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,799
Coming coming

909
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,279
No any very conveniently not asking sort of it

910
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
Who is sitting right

911
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Very

912
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,031
Strong evidence it is now come out that at least as it relates

913
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,311
Do the Syrian hoax

914
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Hashtag

915
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
Twitter

916
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
That was

917
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
No that was a Russian

918
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:33,087
Oh you think so they've traced back the earliest tweets that use the hashtags.

919
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:46,399
Trace back to the earliest ones were in Russia and bizarrely a very high incidence of people

920
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
About that in Somalia

921
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,983
Which could conceivably be bought for

922
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Which is

923
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,567
It does support beep

924
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,383
There's a lady who

925
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,919
Fully documented.

926
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
Beginning of the

927
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
How the operation sort of went

928
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,087
Yeah

929
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:09,439
With the hashtag no more fake Wars

930
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,487
And with

931
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
A call to Arms

932
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
To a group

933
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,327
I am so about

934
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,607
Started retweeting

935
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,399
With a bunch of other hashtags

936
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,447
And immediately Syrian hope Scott

937
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:26,847
Involved in that spread the people

938
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,175
All of these appear to be

939
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Aphakic

940
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
Concentrate

941
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
Attack

942
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
They use the bull

943
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,511
Yeah that's what they did over and over and over again

944
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,047
Until it found its way into the public

945
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:52,703
It's basically you have something that's bouncing back and forth on a really small area

946
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,263
You have a ball that's going back and forth between

947
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
Got two walls that are very close

948
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:03,711
Is there it comes in with momentum it'll keep going much further apart

949
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,783
Run by the same bot Farms

950
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
Start coordinating

951
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,159
On this thread and start putting memes on to it on to this thread

952
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:16,255
Along the way at all times

953
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:20,351
Buy these wars are Jew Wars

954
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
Meme

955
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,935
There is a Mean Machine yes

956
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Most

957
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Import

958
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
So that's how it started

959
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,783
People started

960
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,343
It started trending

961
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
People like Mike cernovich

962
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
Got involved

963
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
So it is

964
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Is it is

965
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Like a

966
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
A literal propaganda

967
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,583
Yes and it is

968
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,935
To believe all sorts of things as long as it fulfills their Global is deep State narrative

969
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:01,567
Yeah they push them really hard and then oh s***

970
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,847
The reality starts

971
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,639
Come out maybe a week later

972
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,175
That this was

973
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,967
Something that was started by Russian

974
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
You can never catch up to it

975
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
What you're going to

976
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
To reject any

977
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:26,399
That would make you look like if you want to go further than just this awesome article

978
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:30,751
Screenshots that documented the beginning of the hashtag

979
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,311
On the topic

980
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Coincidence

981
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:40,991
Hamburger was a member of the International Center

982
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
Counterterrorism

983
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
I'm at The Hague

984
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
His job is to

985
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,623
The study propaganda

986
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
Call techniques

987
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
Hugo the same

988
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
The theory of

989
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
Clear example of Russian

990
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
Influence campaign

991
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,351
Designed to undermine The credibility of the US government

992
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:02,495
Appointment with campaign people involved otherwise be involved

993
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:07,359
A lot of people really characterize themselves as being pro-russian

994
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,919
But they're receiving influence from this campaign

995
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,759
Oh that's the f****** Hague

996
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
So they're dumb

997
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
Yeah

998
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,463
Sugarcoat

999
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,511
Seems more fair in like that

1000
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
It like that way that

1001
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
You go auntie

1002
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,607
TV news and they don't say

1003
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
The president is a liar

1004
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
The president

1005
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,215
False claims

1006
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,263
Has has implied

1007
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,055
Whereas the reality is this

1008
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
I'm not going

1009
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
That's not our job

1010
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
These people

1011
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,991
Are dumb

1012
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
How many say

1013
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,319
You might as well be an honorary proud boy

1014
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,671
So weak mean

1015
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
We have we have what I can

1016
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
ABC and whatever all my research is

1017
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,327
Has led me to believe that they are

1018
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,655
Parroting Russian and pro-assad

1019
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,447
But aren't necessarily based in true

1020
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
Right

1021
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,287
Now what the hell

1022
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:15,199
How they're presenting it is the people are accusing them of being a Sade agent

1023
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,575
Where that's what Alex

1024
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,647
Yeah no one is accusing you of working with Assad

1025
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,487
They're accusing you of having an agenda that matches up with his

1026
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,559
And you're using his propaganda because you've been doing

1027
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,095
Yeah exactly

1028
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,399
And it's hard to admit when you're duped

1029
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,983
Like I very early but right before we started this podcast

1030
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,543
Me and Marty durosoke recorded an episode

1031
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
Of podcast

1032
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
We're talking about

1033
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,527
We've been duped podcast might as well

1034
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
We discussed

1035
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:56,671
Conspiracy theories in Suffolk I bought into stuff for 4

1036
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,719
And to make a conversation more fun

1037
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,255
But there was a point

1038
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,327
It went to its we really did buy into

1039
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
For instance

1040
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,423
The idea that Hillary Clinton was going to die

1041
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Like she was deeply sick

1042
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Now

1043
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,799
We bought into that because

1044
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,103
It did appear that there were videos

1045
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,431
Good

1046
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
No

1047
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
The only real

1048
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
Response that we had to that

1049
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,879
Was afterwards but I know

1050
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
We're dumb

1051
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,719
We f***** up on that one we believe bad sources

1052
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:34,559
We bought into whatever this

1053
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,887
A Mike cernovich knocked on that

1054
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
You never fought

1055
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
That's not being a man

1056
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,615
Well I would argue of course it's not being a man and so far

1057
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,199
I'm done with man

1058
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,295
Adult

1059
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Nebulous concept of what is it in adult

1060
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Being an adult

1061
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,391
Being a f***

1062
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,207
Big Mouth Maury

1063
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:08,607
So now you get the glimpse of this round table that we're having in this team of superpowers cuz he's

1064
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
Huge followings on the Rhone

1065
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,215
Cowboys L over here

1066
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,519
We've got the dummy who believes

1067
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,359
Pro-russian propaganda and

1068
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:25,759
And fully documented is a fragile broken human being

1069
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,439
Somehow we have more

1070
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
Poor heartbroken

1071
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
Useless

1072
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
Remember

1073
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,375
Might as well be an intellect

1074
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,655
Blah blah blah

1075
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,935
Human remember

1076
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Never going to not

1077
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
Be angry at you

1078
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
For telling me about

1079
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
Like

1080
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,943
Personal level the fact that I now know that the

1081
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
The proud boys exist

1082
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
Is going to SLC

1083
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,527
With you

1084
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
For the rest

1085
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,367
Turn my lights on the back of my head

1086
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,135
I'm going to be thinking

1087
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,975
Cowboys

1088
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
Always there

1089
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,767
Volibear

1090
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Always

1091
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,631
I want you to remember that you're making an argument

1092
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,519
You're making an argument that we should have empathy for anyone who

1093
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,311
Bill's group called The Proud boys

1094
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:25,663
Remember that later as this goes on let me let me go

1095
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,687
Let me do this

1096
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Just because

1097
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
I have a

1098
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
Does not mean I also don't want

1099
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
Every single person

1100
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
On the entire planet

1101
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
To hit them in the

1102
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
The face

1103
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,839
Punch them right that's silly mustache

1104
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
In that dumb face

1105
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
Yeah right in the dumb face

1106
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,263
McGinnis

1107
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
Was being asked

1108
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Alex

1109
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,591
What's your response

1110
00:58:54,847 --> 00:59:00,735
To being called a Russian agent for Assad agent

1111
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,807
No service

1112
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
And here is his answer

1113
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,487
That really goes bad

1114
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,631
Yeah I was just talked to him on the phone right now from here

1115
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,191
Via Skype

1116
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
I don't care

1117
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,847
I don't care if it was actors I don't care if they just had kids do like that

1118
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:32,479
The big picture is that the world a bad thing

1119
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,807
On the bad thing and now women respect him

1120
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:42,207
It here

1121
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:46,047
He's talking about the pictures of the Gap Kids

1122
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
You should care if it's

1123
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,655
A lot of people

1124
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:55,519
Those people could totally not die but if it's real or fake

1125
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
Kill people

1126
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
If it's not real

1127
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,175
Ghost

1128
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,223
Phaeton Ally

1129
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,527
Idea

1130
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,391
15 goddamn years later maybe

1131
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
We were

1132
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Speedway

1133
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
You should

1134
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,583
Not start a war based on a lie on Twitter also

1135
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
That goes back to that

1136
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,447
But do you like don't you love that boat

1137
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
Real or not

1138
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,103
What ends up happening is big man has to make Boom-Boom to impress woman

1139
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Feel like I'm

1140
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,183
I bet you don't like

1141
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,023
Just for the verges remotely like entertain what is it

1142
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
Feel like I'm

1143
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
These assholes

1144
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,399
Hurtful it hurts probably

1145
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,703
Probably very unpleasant

1146
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,239
Like within

1147
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
Go home

1148
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
And they're watching to

1149
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
And their brain is right

1150
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,687
Yeah

1151
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,295
Right I would assume

1152
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
How to spell Mia

1153
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,135
I think that's a pretty human thing

1154
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
Really

1155
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
And the depth of

1156
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Because I don't

1157
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,559
Small and child

1158
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
I feel

1159
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
The world

1160
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,959
And I feel that way

1161
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
Cuz the world

1162
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Is ending

1163
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
Right now

1164
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,127
5 years ago or so we didn't have proud boys in the world

1165
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,479
Beautiful weather in Revelation

1166
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:45,599
Actually there are the four proud boys of the Apocalypse

1167
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,327
Exactly so you actually goes on further and I think it actually gets even more

1168
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,079
Cuz he said he would draw a line in the sand and he got caught

1169
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,151
So that's awesome you killed as you say the Russian

1170
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,783
Wiped out

1171
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,743
Tears are absolute animals they dismembered our soldiers

1172
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:30,143
Fingers are

1173
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
Hear them with huge fireworks

1174
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
Also

1175
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,943
FedEx

1176
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:51,647
No it's not

1177
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,767
Women are actually against the patriarchy

1178
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
That's our whole goal

1179
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:05,727
You remember how they say that all the time.

1180
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
Speak out against

1181
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:11,359
Secretly wanted the rest of them are cool

1182
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Added space

1183
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
That is the

1184
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,831
Slightly

1185
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Aggressive

1186
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
No she actually

1187
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:32,095
That's exactly what that metaphor

1188
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:37,983
You don't know what you think

1189
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,055
It's absolutely on its face not true

1190
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:45,151
It implies some sort of like secret knowledge of women

1191
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,223
Fit like cookies talkin to Proud boys most of the time

1192
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,503
They don't know

1193
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,343
Whatever he says he seems cool he started Vice

1194
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,135
Bus know what women think

1195
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
No

1196
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,023
We know a lot of women who are feminists

1197
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,071
We know a lot of women who

1198
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:06,143
Are on the fence about what they want identify themselves

1199
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,191
I don't think that any of them are like

1200
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
I really

1201
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,287
Secretly wish man ruled everything

1202
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Every Woman

1203
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:21,759
Told me

1204
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,391
Captain on my Armand Moore's

1205
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:33,791
Oh yeah yeah

1206
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
Like to make as much as a man

1207
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
Which is really saying

1208
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
So cool

1209
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
I make more than me

1210
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,055
That sort of thing and I didn't know that I was actually in the proud girls

1211
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,871
So when we did learn about that

1212
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:53,503
Jesus the cookies are way better though beyond that he's

1213
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:59,135
Trump's actions have destroyed the Russian narrative

1214
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
The dropping of the

1215
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
Mother of all bombs

1216
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,815
On Afghanistan almost immediately after news broke that

1217
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Countries

1218
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Relayed information

1219
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,911
United States intelligence

1220
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,191
Community

1221
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
Trump surrogate

1222
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,543
We're directly meeting with Russian spy

1223
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,895
The idea that this is going to stop that

1224
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
No absolutely

1225
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,991
Did the proliferation of information is

1226
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,783
It's gone too far.

1227
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,599
No probably not reflect

1228
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,647
Why can't they

1229
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:36,255
Because if they pull the trigger too early they bought the entire thing

1230
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,559
This is how it goes with investigations

1231
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
If it's not

1232
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,679
If it if it's not Ironclad you're going to end up

1233
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,983
Coming into early that's exactly what the

1234
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
The CIA said

1235
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,519
Delete

1236
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,359
Lee Harvey Oswald

1237
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,919
Jump too early

1238
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
Stop this

1239
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,503
It's clear

1240
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,551
At least at the okay

1241
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,135
Circumstantially it's clear that

1242
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:03,903
The president

1243
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
Committed

1244
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
Yeah

1245
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,023
It does not matter if he actually committed

1246
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,095
Not ruin the entire world

1247
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
The American

1248
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,447
That guy committed tree

1249
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,007
So let's not have that

1250
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,567
Can we just not have that guy

1251
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,127
Like if you're if you're in the GOP can you just

1252
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,711
F****** balls

1253
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,015
To just be like hey no

1254
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,135
Can we have a do-over

1255
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,415
Jewel

1256
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:42,815
I'd like that

1257
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
Information

1258
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Request

1259
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,655
Made about the pool

1260
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
And the states the Trump won

1261
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,263
Boost stores

1262
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,359
North Carolina's Michigan

1263
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,711
Connect

1264
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,991
90 reports

1265
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,551
Malfunctioning machines

1266
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,623
They're 90 reports about malfunctioning machines

1267
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
Enso state

1268
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:14,303
All that information is about to come out

1269
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
I've no idea could this be like

1270
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:21,727
Oh these poor counties had bad machine

1271
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:25,055
Too far

1272
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:32,479
Plastic

1273
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,015
About

1274
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:39,135
We were talking about presidency

1275
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Having deeply

1276
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,463
Democratic

1277
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
Counties

1278
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
That are

1279
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
Heavily

1280
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,351
Disenfranchised population

1281
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
Giving and refusing to

1282
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:55,775
Didn't employ

1283
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
The GOP

1284
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
Is it couldn't win

1285
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:08,063
Good at that like historically in America date

1286
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,367
Always do that

1287
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,183
Alright you guys got us this time

1288
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,975
Where were bumble

1289
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
Now

1290
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,839
The proud boys are winning over

1291
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,215
Can we get a music sting of that

1292
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,799
Wildboyz

1293
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,103
Anyway the next

1294
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,151
Clipper going into

1295
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:36,223
Is a little bit of discussion about that mother of all bombs

1296
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
It was dropped

1297
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,295
I mean

1298
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,831
If it's about

1299
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
Fair to college

1300
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,879
Distraction because it's

1301
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,671
Real Act of War

1302
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Yeah but it

1303
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,511
The timing of it is very f****** weird

1304
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,327
It's very f****** weird

1305
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:03,615
Please works like that the only escalation past business is nuclear

1306
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,919
Bombs in Lubbock

1307
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:14,623
I realize that I totally cut you off nearest Starbucks

1308
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
He said that was

1309
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
His proudest

1310
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
Not too

1311
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,119
Because it demonstrates restraint

1312
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,959
It does the whole thing because literally everybody in the government

1313
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
Told him that he now has

1314
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,031
Blow them up

1315
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
He's the only voice

1316
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,359
And now you look

1317
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,175
Everybody who was in his government and they're all like

1318
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,223
That's the most beautiful

1319
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
Bomb the fuckout

1320
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,319
Gorgeous

1321
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,135
Also this leads into Gavin

1322
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,823
Obama's mess

1323
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,455
Kill Them All

1324
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:21,183
To carry out his constitutional orders

1325
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
I like the team

1326
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,335
But they were saying that to Obama

1327
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
The guy who

1328
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
Ordered

1329
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,431
And succeeded in killing

1330
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,479
Thesamba

1331
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,295
I don't know cuz Alex's mixing up his narrative

1332
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,575
Alex

1333
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:55,231
Alex is all over the feeling on this is

1334
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,535
Bin Laden was killed

1335
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:07,007
That was all it was all a cover-up and what have you

1336
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:12,383
There's no winning if you're Obama did you see the

1337
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,967
The the most amazing people I think I've ever seen

1338
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,039
Democrats

1339
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
Who supports

1340
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,183
37% when Obama

1341
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
37 /

1342
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,767
That's great that's consistency

1343
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,791
The GOP

1344
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,351
Prior when it was Obama

1345
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
10%

1346
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
When is Trump

1347
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
89

1348
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,799
F****** believe a consistency

1349
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:44,127
I don't know kind of ideology

1350
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,151
The other than

1351
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:45,919
We don't like

1352
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
You really did just

1353
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,159
Just explain it

1354
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
Really f******

1355
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
Stupid s*** that all explained at the end

1356
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:08,959
I'll even crippled our guys over there I was talking to Terry schappert recently and I said how do we win this war and he goes let us do our

1357
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Our job

1358
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,287
I mean right now they got RPG

1359
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:24,831
He misunderstood in order to save our lives because they were shooting from the mosque and they got the don't shoot the mod Pizza

1360
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:30,719
What we were trying to kill them

1361
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,023
We got to let these are dogs loose

1362
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:40,703
I want the Terrace be going

1363
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
The Middle East

1364
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:48,127
By the way

1365
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,455
Track 10

1366
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:02,719
Composition

1367
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,047
These people are stupid

1368
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,071
Something within set

1369
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:11,423
But then also the Rules of Engagement

1370
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,639
There's no authorization that's needed to respond

1371
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,943
So the idea

1372
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,807
Do you would have to call back and be like

1373
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
You know I don't

1374
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,391
I don't know I don't know

1375
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,511
I'm not going to speculate on that there are any number of reasons

1376
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,815
Even if it was

1377
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,887
Is it symbolic situation

1378
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:46,239
They're pretty regular

1379
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,311
That argument is flimsy

1380
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,127
Yeah it is a flimsy argument

1381
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,687
Military history

1382
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,735
There's a lot of dumb s*** that people do and say

1383
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
I know Alex when he was sick

1384
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
But

1385
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,695
That's fair enough my position is the

1386
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
Defensive

1387
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,559
Things are very different than assault

1388
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:14,655
I talked to a vet again

1389
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,495
Anecdotal story

1390
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
Is

1391
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
Contestable

1392
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,103
And furthermore we know that he has

1393
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Talk to

1394
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,687
Blank and there is never actually

1395
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,295
So I'm at work I just think that's that's pretty stupid

1396
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
It's very steep

1397
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
I don't

1398
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
What are you

1399
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,679
The solution is to kill more people obviously

1400
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
How many p

1401
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
Ludacris

1402
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,543
It's ludicrous

1403
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,615
Yeah yeah I did always do seem to be

1404
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,895
Sort of

1405
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
The poor

1406
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
The author

1407
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:05,855
It's so simple

1408
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,159
Did the mother of all bombs

1409
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,695
Cos 310 million

1410
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
Biggest 314

1411
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,255
Yeah something like that

1412
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,583
Swampert firebomb yearly budget

1413
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
Eddie number

1414
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,423
It accomplished

1415
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Nothing

1416
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,495
Regular other than to show that week

1417
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,263
Can make a big

1418
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,823
It killed 36 Isis members

1419
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,895
And I'm at number was upgraded till like 90 something

1420
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:34,015
Is dubious before people

1421
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
That's not worth it

1422
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,343
Anyway

1423
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:45,535
But beyond that there's no estimate that I've been able to find

1424
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,143
The amount of civilians that are killed by a bomb that has a blast radius of a mile

1425
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
I can't imagine how many

1426
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
People died

1427
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
Yeah

1428
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,567
This is this is why

1429
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:58,847
Like

1430
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,383
It is really important

1431
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
To realize

1432
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
That America is

1433
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Is not the good guy

1434
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,295
Certainly not by default

1435
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,343
F****** at this point

1436
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,647
Russia's kind of a better guy than we are

1437
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,487
If they just stay out of it for like 10 years ago

1438
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
But

1439
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,303
We're getting off track

1440
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:24,447
This is this is not the let's discuss American foreign policy

1441
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:32,127
More about Sebastian Gorka

1442
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,479
Cuz now we're going to take a sharp Veer from this war

1443
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:38,783
Culture

1444
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,831
And this next

1445
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,671
Clip explains is all about

1446
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
You know like

1447
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,743
If you really want to get into

1448
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,279
The truth about the left

1449
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
It's right here

1450
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:56,191
I'm assuming that they know about the left hand

1451
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:58,239
Sure I certainly died

1452
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
More about the

1453
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,055
That plays in

1454
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,855
On Earth

1455
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
What

1456
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,487
The song about being in bed with

1457
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,863
Microphone

1458
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,447
They're so

1459
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,919
That they will roll into the most nasty crap in the world

1460
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,319
Quality culture

1461
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:48,671
Assuage pain

1462
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:55,071
Well I think it's because they hate the family and why do they have the family I don't know they have daddy issues

1463
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:01,471
Maybe they're weak and they can't bear the idea of having kids and having a proposal

1464
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:07,871
Green shape lies are overwhelmed by their own magic their own they're sentient being

1465
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,967
Batman just don't have the balls to stop playing video games and actually put a ring on it

1466
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:18,367
I saw they created this world for everything about them is anti-family more a wedding

1467
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,959
Extremists who want to obliterate

1468
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:39,359
Directions to

1469
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,383
Hijab on my head

1470
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,687
That's interesting.

1471
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:47,039
I would embarrass me being sarcastic

1472
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:50,111
I would posit that it's possible liberals

1473
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:53,695
Are cool with Muslims because we're into

1474
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:59,327
The diversity of opinion diversity of cultures

1475
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,887
I would save it all liberals

1476
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,655
But I've ever met

1477
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,191
I already

1478
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
Things like genital mutilation

1479
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,543
Child child Brides

1480
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,591
False flag

1481
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:14,943
That are part of primitive culture that

1482
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,735
In parts of the developing world

1483
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,503
We are

1484
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
Those things

1485
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
And that

1486
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:24,927
Not at all religious theocracy

1487
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,511
It's not at all fair to point the finger at all Muslims

1488
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,791
You cut clits off

1489
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:36,191
You know that's not fair at all it's not fair to say that

1490
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,471
I'm sort of sign of a pressure

1491
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:41,567
I don't want to get it on a soapbox here and make an argument that

1492
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:46,431
World that I'm totally outside of

1493
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:50,015
Yeah but I do know a number of Muslim people in a lot of conversations that I've had

1494
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
It's a choice

1495
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
The choice you can make

1496
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,087
It is

1497
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,391
It's not really a big deal

1498
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,927
It all comes back to

1499
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,207
If you guys have never met

1500
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,559
It's like I've never met people like 12 year old Christians were

1501
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,327
Yeah

1502
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,679
Yeah true to some extent never experienced any part of the actual world

1503
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,239
These people have retreated inside of their fantasy

1504
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,031
Cuz they're afraid to go out

1505
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:18,432
Yet that y'all Liberals are in bubbles

1506
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,760
Play video games and yet at the same time they're sitting in with

1507
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:28,160
The f****** proud boys getting tapped on the shoulder

1508
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:34,560
Oh no

1509
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,840
Where was Bubba Smith

1510
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Goodbar the

1511
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,168
First one you came up with the weird

1512
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,704
I like bananas

1513
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
Is there anything more you

1514
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,288
You're going to have to put down the mic

1515
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
A bunch

1516
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,872
For the segment that's about to happen

1517
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,408
Cuz it's so bad

1518
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:53,248
So at this point I tweeted about this and I saw it really

1519
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,296
Kind of bad about the tweet I made

1520
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Cuz

1521
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:00,672
I felt like I might have been missile lining for conversation of tiny bit

1522
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,632
Rage

1523
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,936
My very nature to second-guess points

1524
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,568
For experience I still second-guess and question

1525
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,616
Like a cuck I treated that

1526
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
Mike cernovich

1527
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:27,552
Gavin McInnes and Alex Jones are having a rousing round table about how women secretly want to get hit by

1528
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:32,160
I treated that man I fell really insecure cuz some guy tweeted at Mike cernovich

1529
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:38,560
I was worried that they would edited out of the rebroadcast I wouldn't be able

1530
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,096
Find the evidence

1531
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
Here comes the avative

1532
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
There we go

1533
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,704
I want to say that I was a little bit wrong cuz they were

1534
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
Simply talking about 7s

1535
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
And

1536
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,384
Your workout this is this is an act

1537
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,432
A place that will come out in

1538
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,480
At least two acts maybe three

1539
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,552
Here is the first one of it and I sort of about

1540
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,088
How families secretly want to be

1541
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Free slaves

1542
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:12,096
In a family-friendly but a lot of feminists do have very dark desires Fifty Shades of Grey sold a lot of copies and

1543
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,144
There might be a little bit

1544
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,496
I want to say this is my son

1545
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:25,152
We haven't really heard his voice all that much

1546
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
Mike cernovich

1547
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,712
We've mostly

1548
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:33,344
Clip so far

1549
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,392
Spouting his brand

1550
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,696
Misogyny

1551
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
I will stay

1552
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,072
He comes he's a little bit more self-aware than the other two little play out

1553
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,864
In a second

1554
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,704
Want to get to sort of

1555
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:55,104
In a family-friendly but a lot of feminists do have very dark desires Fifty Shades of Grey sold a lot of copies and

1556
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,712
You know so there might be a little bit they maybe they like that Dominic component of Islam and maybe

1557
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
Feminism

1558
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:08,928
Respect

1559
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:21,728
Exactly

1560
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:26,592
These people really

1561
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:32,992
Everybody really wants the strong alpha male figure

1562
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,648
Smartpoints

1563
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,440
Cuz you screamed over that clip

1564
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:48,096
Cuz we're not being real man and we're just down beta cuck

1565
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,984
I don't think that's really

1566
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
They're saying

1567
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:01,664
Take this unfairly out of contact this is the conversation

1568
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,320
Coming out of their mouths

1569
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,856
Don't me

1570
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
F*****'-a

1571
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
Any size

1572
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,120
That because Fifty Shades of Grey

1573
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,912
And these ideas about

1574
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:25,984
Consensual BDSM kind of fantasies

1575
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
Most

1576
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
Middle-aged

1577
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,848
Bulls Housewives

1578
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,552
Read like an old romance novel

1579
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,232
Similarly

1580
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,024
Sort of aggressive fantasies

1581
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
Contain

1582
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,840
It wasn't all just like

1583
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,632
Super romantic

1584
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,912
Flower petal

1585
01:24:55,424 --> 01:25:01,568
Like there was there was that sort of thread throughout romance novels through Street the reason

1586
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:12,064
But then Alex related to like Islam

1587
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
Slave block

1588
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,696
All this stuff for Mike cernovich f***** up

1589
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,232
He said

1590
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:23,072
About

1591
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:25,632
This darker sexuality

1592
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
Feminist

1593
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,776
I think it's stupid but there's something you could unpack in there

1594
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,128
Power dynamics

1595
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,920
Consensually is

1596
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:46,368
There's one thing I didn't really discuss it interesting thing that goes on tonight

1597
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,720
Play describing all of these

1598
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:54,048
Btsm things that feminist secretly want from there

1599
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,096
Islamic managers

1600
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,632
How much do you get paid to be an ace

1601
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,776
Is it like an hour

1602
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:10,176
Being submissive in your sexual life really has nothing to do with what you do

1603
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,760
And if you really want to talk about how these women

1604
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,552
Secretly want a big dick

1605
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,576
All that stuff

1606
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,440
Unfortunately

1607
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,048
Rinaldi's

1608
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,448
They told me stories

1609
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:35,008
Leaving out people's names for privacy

1610
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:39,872
Super powerful bankers and then people like that to them and want to get beat

1611
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,176
Essentially they want to be punished

1612
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,272
Diaper play comes with

1613
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,296
It's a lot like if

1614
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
If you are

1615
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,368
Publicly

1616
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
A heterosexual

1617
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,184
You might

1618
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,000
The club

1619
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,376
You just have to write your name

1620
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,168
Tell me more

1621
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,704
What type of butter do you like

1622
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:11,872
Is it the visit landolakes.com

1623
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,408
Margarine spread

1624
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,784
I think we could encapsulate

1625
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
That they should have gotten

1626
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:25,696
But can't buy saying sexuality is an incredibly complicated

1627
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,400
It doesn't have anything to do with feminism

1628
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,752
This idea that Alex

1629
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,800
Seems to keep coming back to use it is

1630
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,640
White women are going with Muslim men cuz they want to be oppressed

1631
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:47,712
Because all these white men are not men their cocks

1632
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Ignoring it

1633
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
Like you said it again

1634
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,208
I just kind of slide through

1635
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:58,976
My brain because

1636
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,024
At like how do you even engaged

1637
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,560
Makes so little

1638
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,400
That's kind of our show

1639
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,984
Good point

1640
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:16,384
We just choose our spots so anyway this next Clipper going to get a little bit deeper into it

1641
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:22,784
I'm going to play this play out throughout

1642
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
This episode is

1643
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,088
Please put that my time

1644
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,136
You're the

1645
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,160
The trends that I want you to

1646
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,488
You keep an eye out for the things that that I think are the most in

1647
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,768
First one

1648
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,584
Is a generous use of the word metaphor

1649
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,120
Haha

1650
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,912
The 2nd

1651
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,984
Is that Mike cernovich

1652
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
Open burn

1653
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:43,776
And he knows

1654
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,592
What Media Matters is going to do with this

1655
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,640
And so he jumps into save it

1656
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,456
Okay and I actually think it's really smart as him

1657
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,992
Like we've discussed

1658
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,296
Media Matters is pretty manipulative

1659
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,088
Sometimes with how they choose to cut

1660
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:02,464
Eclipse in terms of where the start point is where the end point is

1661
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,744
Now based on

1662
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,280
Who bought I just said about his act

1663
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:10,656
Westcliff is clearly on the wrong side of ideology in the sentence

1664
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,192
In this particular case

1665
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,240
He doesn't deserve

1666
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
Hit by

1667
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,176
He's just smart about how he gets

1668
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:31,648
Exactly what when they call us

1669
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:39,072
And that semester asking for a metaphorical now not little nothing for a metaphorical slap

1670
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:39,840
Where you going

1671
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:45,984
Don't you dare talk to me like that engine on the concrete sometimes a woman needs at the club.

1672
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:52,640
Sometimes a woman needs to smack

1673
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:04,672
This sacrilege

1674
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:11,072
White women just for the dance floor

1675
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:16,704
Dancing or asses off they love testosterone and they're only pretend

1676
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,592
Beta male allies

1677
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,128
Then a feminist man

1678
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152
Huh

1679
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,456
So there we go

1680
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,040
Fryer

1681
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:35,648
I think they're I think baby one thing that makes them dryer is

1682
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,208
Guys discussing the moisture level of their p****

1683
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
That's

1684
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,768
Also

1685
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,072
Nothing makes my dick limper

1686
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
In charge

1687
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:57,152
Runaway

1688
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:06,368
But to her profile

1689
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,904
I'm looking for a woman who is

1690
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,976
Involved in her own interests

1691
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:17,376
So Gavin starts talking about how whenever women Gallatin white white mansion

1692
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,704
From a man

1693
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:24,032
Metaphorically

1694
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,592
Hold on and then

1695
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,176
Directly there the point is made from that is

1696
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,712
Bring up

1697
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,248
Sean Connery's quote

1698
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:38,624
I'm I'm sort of it's jumping into being like metaphorically

1699
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,440
Has slapped a woman

1700
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:52,192
And it might have been buried in that a little bit and listen to it again

1701
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,216
He said

1702
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,312
Doesn't work

1703
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,640
The men he mumbles

1704
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,408
From what I've heard

1705
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
I don't know if

1706
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
He's had women

1707
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:08,064
But that's a bad quote

1708
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,344
You know what a better quote

1709
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,368
Don't hit women

1710
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,440
Can really stay

1711
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:16,000
No not really

1712
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,280
Wouldn't actually

1713
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:20,352
Then they would never have thought

1714
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:27,008
Don't hit women rightly is like

1715
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:27,776
Coming to be like

1716
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:33,920
Media Matters is going to cut this which he's right he's totally right and because he said those things

1717
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,480
Now it's not really as usable the clip for them

1718
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,528
Sweet kind of playing defense

1719
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,552
Really smart light

1720
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:46,464
How's that defends like if you put the whole clip on there

1721
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,000
Then all you're really

1722
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,304
Is that these guys

1723
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,584
Legitimately

1724
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,608
Believe that

1725
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
What they're saying

1726
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,168
Yeah

1727
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Has

1728
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,984
The slightest amount of

1729
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,008
Clever and

1730
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,032
To say

1731
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,824
Well look at them

1732
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,128
Choosing to report our word

1733
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,200
Guys

1734
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
Guys

1735
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,528
This territory is not

1736
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,368
Waring Waring murky story

1737
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:16,928
Really

1738
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:20,768
The

1739
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,048
Parents

1740
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,328
Terrific

1741
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
White women

1742
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,424
Flood to the dam

1743
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,520
The South

1744
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
Stang

1745
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,568
Miscegenation

1746
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,456
Interracial dating and everything

1747
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,784
That goes along with

1748
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,320
Just the idea

1749
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,368
I mean that is entirely

1750
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,648
Let's party

1751
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:53,024
Hannibal

1752
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
He's white women

1753
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,632
Gravitate towards them cuz I was white man event pussies for so long

1754
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,424
What's nonsense

1755
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,192
Sphere

1756
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Beer

1757
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,008
And impotence

1758
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,032
Justice

1759
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:13,760
One of the most important pieces of it is a deep-seated

1760
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,088
Yeah if I was Media Matters

1761
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,624
That's the clip that I talk

1762
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,160
Because

1763
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:23,744
Your race

1764
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,280
You could make about that not

1765
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,328
Racist or them saying well

1766
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,912
You know I love every race and I don't believe in any kind of race

1767
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,704
Pure white

1768
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:39,104
Man fear the most

1769
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
Blackface with rubber

1770
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:42,432
So I mean

1771
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:49,344
Who is Nigel McGuinness

1772
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,904
I agree with you

1773
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Anyway

1774
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,976
Mike cernovich is kind of smart again which is like

1775
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,768
I got to steal this in another Direction

1776
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,048
And these guys are going off on

1777
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,936
Hitting women tangent we can't do this so Mike cernovich

1778
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,264
I got to be honest

1779
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,848
I dislike him quite a bit from his

1780
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,384
I think crnkovich is smarter

1781
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,408
Ben Alex

1782
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,600
You know what I can do I can shift this into talking about Alec Baldwin

1783
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,352
Champa massage unit

1784
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,888
Mel Gibson

1785
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:40,032
Mel Gibson was yelling sugar tits and being anti-Semitic

1786
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:42,592
Cop that pulled him over and he was wasted

1787
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,408
Back the f******

1788
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
Who gives a s***

1789
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,248
There's not a false equivalency

1790
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,808
No but I can't you can't be like well

1791
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,392
He said all this s*** so immediately any

1792
01:35:55,648 --> 01:36:00,768
Trump is worthless

1793
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,752
We don't even support him in that

1794
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,776
Congratulations

1795
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,312
On your comedy

1796
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,920
Yeah course

1797
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:25,344
Typing a domestic abuse or the way he talked on The View

1798
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:46,592
Yeah we just got to make sure

1799
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:49,664
Emotional abuse

1800
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:59,136
I want to know why

1801
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:05,536
Why we get taken out of context

1802
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:11,936
On the answering machine and yet nobody's trying to advertise him

1803
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:17,824
Why do you think that is

1804
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,616
Donald Trump

1805
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,384
It's known

1806
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,664
I've never touched a woman

1807
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,504
Aw and he's never hit a lady he's never raped his wife

1808
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,320
She never wrote about it in a book

1809
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,672
Please play he's ever

1810
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,208
Buckley said that you should

1811
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,280
Grab a Woman by the p****

1812
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,072
Walked into underage

1813
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
Dressing room

1814
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:40,608
For his

1815
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,376
Model shows

1816
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,168
He's never

1817
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,752
You know been the target of multiple multiple

1818
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,288
Great Glam

1819
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,824
Sexual harassment laws

1820
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,616
Sure never never

1821
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,664
It's

1822
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,992
It's also of all the men

1823
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,296
None are more virtuous

1824
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,088
Also I want to say it's

1825
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,624
It's kind of important

1826
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,160
I think

1827
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,440
Alex just committed

1828
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,208
Slander

1829
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,768
Because I don't know of any instant

1830
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,816
Necessarily

1831
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,584
I haven't

1832
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,632
Fully researched Baldwin

1833
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,704
But he hits women

1834
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,472
It is

1835
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,752
Reported

1836
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,568
I don't know if that's reported but

1837
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,808
Baldwin

1838
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
These guys are f******

1839
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
Monster

1840
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,928
They only care about Alec Baldwin because he

1841
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,696
Impersonates

1842
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
That's the only reason

1843
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,560
Shake it all the liberal like

1844
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,680
So it doesn't matter how many

1845
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:50,240
How many young women are leading the charge

1846
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
Against this

1847
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,312
Because Alec Baldwin has a

1848
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,080
The dumbass

1849
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,104
Clip where he does

1850
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:56,896
Bacon

1851
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,920
Compare it negative

1852
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,712
To f****** whatever

1853
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,480
What is a goddamn

1854
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,528
Yep they never actually have to

1855
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,552
Engage with the fact

1856
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,624
Monstrous

1857
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,904
What it is they're saying

1858
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
2 take away agent

1859
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:17,376
Horrific f****** b******* a perpetuating on this show and flip it

1860
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,912
Is isn't

1861
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:27,360
To be saying these sorts of things out of one side of their mouths and have the other side be like

1862
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,384
He women

1863
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:32,480
You don't understand the implied pieces of the things you're saying

1864
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
Because you're racist

1865
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,272
When you hate women

1866
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:40,416
But we're off the charts for now and we're going to get into

1867
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
Talking about how

1868
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,000
The left is dumb

1869
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,048
You don't do you know why it's good

1870
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,840
Do you know what I really like it

1871
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,632
Feeling self

1872
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,496
Some sort of paragon of virtue

1873
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:59,616
I think something we both we both know lives

1874
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,688
High Road

1875
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:04,992
This is

1876
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,576
Truly monster

1877
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,856
Who cares

1878
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,392
Visit Warsaw

1879
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,928
I promise you

1880
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,976
But for now it's okay

1881
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,792
We threw the most

1882
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,072
Anger I've experienced

1883
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,096
Many many

1884
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:26,496
But for now the King of The Proud boys

1885
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,032
Is going to come in and explain.

1886
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
The left

1887
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,568
Dumb

1888
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
Right

1889
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,384
Is all about

1890
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,176
Alex

1891
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,456
I'm going to stay some facts

1892
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:37,760
Anime soon as the clip is done

1893
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,296
I'm going to tell you the real fat

1894
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:42,880
Alright enjoy this rollercoaster ride

1895
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:50,048
You know they followed Obama through everything they followed Clinton through the cigar incident that 13

1896
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:56,448
Dallas Cowboys I mean it's frustrating that were fractured

1897
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:08,992
Are there

1898
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,672
It America

1899
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,232
So Alex Jones fake laugh there but also

1900
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:23,584
One woman told him there were 70 billion

1901
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,864
That's insane

1902
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,472
A dump very dumb person

1903
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,752
Who told him that

1904
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
Who might not exist

1905
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:35,104
It might that do it might just be a completely made-up thing

1906
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:39,200
Also complete the numbers of illegal aliens

1907
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,528
Not the right nomenclature

1908
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,576
You don't want to call people illegal

1909
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,112
Undocumented immigrants

1910
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:46,880
Whatever

1911
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:50,464
The Beatles number are people on the right

1912
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,768
Someone saying there's

1913
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
3 million

1914
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:56,608
Illegal immigrants vote in the election

1915
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:04,544
Statistically impossible number me that weirdo dude on Twitter who had like eight followers and then blown up

1916
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,944
Exploded and he's been interviewed on the news is I got sources Avenida never has any of them

1917
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,552
Quite literally Impala

1918
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:18,368
That's one of my favorite things that is gone

1919
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
Very unanalyzed

1920
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:23,232
I think most of the population is

1921
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,256
Where is that

1922
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,048
Like sort of myth started

1923
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,840
I might write something for the website about that

1924
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,376
Just because of how stupid it is

1925
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,936
DIY ideas

1926
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,472
There's more

1927
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:36,032
Immigrants undocumented then

1928
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:37,824
Laugh

1929
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,592
Is

1930
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,616
Conservative

1931
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:42,944
Right-wing idea 70 billion

1932
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:48,064
It's probably a right-wing dum dum dum dum

1933
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,416
Somebody who does not know that

1934
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:58,304
There are only 7 billion people

1935
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,072
That means

1936
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,352
A lady told him

1937
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:03,936
There are more illegal immigrants than the number of human beings

1938
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,960
Who have ever

1939
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,776
Can you talk about

1940
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:10,336
The current population

1941
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:11,872
Existence

1942
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,896
It estimated at 50

1943
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,944
Boulevard ghost

1944
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,248
You always get

1945
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,528
12 dimensional ghosts

1946
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:25,440
So where we got the clip Alex was fake laughing and now he's going to get into his rant about facts

1947
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,744
Is the number to throughout

1948
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,072
And you realize this is all posturing to you

1949
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:45,920
Culter35

1950
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,480
1.5 billion China

1951
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,272
25 in India

1952
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:56,672
They don't know any of the stuff I don't know the population White America 600

1953
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:01,536
6 million

1954
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,632
Somebody tells me the population of a place

1955
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
That's a conspiracy

1956
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,192
Write this stupid

1957
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:10,240
That's that's really stupid

1958
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:13,056
No but also he's just rattling off fact

1959
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,336
Turn off

1960
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,408
Will you know if you know five things then that means everything

1961
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,968
Let me walk you through each one of these

1962
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:20,736
Alright

1963
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:24,576
Population of the world is 7.5 billion

1964
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,600
That is about

1965
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,904
Is that one

1966
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:34,304
We got one on the board for Alex Alex Jones Heather 35 million illegal immigrants in the country

1967
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,584
Furtively conservative

1968
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:38,656
So that would be roughly 10% of the entire United

1969
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:43,776
Pew Research Center there's 11 million illegal immigrants

1970
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,568
2014

1971
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,360
The trend has been moving downwards

1972
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
Every year

1973
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:52,480
Yes even according to the wacky ass website

1974
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,272
The figure in 2016 is 10

1975
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,296
10.5 ml

1976
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:58,624
According to right-wing wingding site

1977
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,672
It is a third of what he say

1978
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:06,304
Yes and the actual number is probably right in there 10 million or so

1979
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:09,888
5 million

1980
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,936
Alex says

1981
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,472
The actual number is 1 points

1982
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,240
3 billion

1983
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,032
Which seems small but it's billion

1984
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,616
2.2 million

1985
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:24,992
I am willing to

1986
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:27,040
To give him the b******* Roundup

1987
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,624
I'm going to give him the b******* I'm not I'm not

1988
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,184
Alright cuz we were talking billions

1989
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:39,840
Talk about when he talked about that is that it

1990
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:42,400
The percentage of the world's population that that represent

1991
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:44,960
Has been trending downward every year for

1992
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,496
A great number of years

1993
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,264
Oh yeah

1994
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:54,432
They are growing slower than the rest of the World stroller

1995
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
In that

1996
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,016
Because culture

1997
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,344
Right now women out now

1998
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,112
Number Madden

1999
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:05,440
Dating age nearly 10 21

2000
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,232
Tell course their population is

2001
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:12,608
Is it more

2002
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,888
Significant that he's

2003
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:16,448
.2% off because it's trending downward

2004
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:19,008
So he can't even be like

2005
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:27,200
India's population is 1.5 billion the actual number again is 1 Point

2006
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,992
3 billion

2007
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,808
Is there is there actual population growth

2008
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:38,464
Has been trending downwards every single year since 1983

2009
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,000
Is actually getting

2010
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,024
Smaller

2011
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,560
Percentage-wise every year

2012
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:45,120
They're their growth has gone down

2013
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,728
Let me know again he's off by 200

2014
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:50,752
Million people

2015
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:53,824
And the pictures of what's going to happen in the future

2016
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:59,456
He says that the population of United States 335 million the truth is it 300

2017
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,736
6 million

2018
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,528
Again

2019
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,832
Giving a temp

2020
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,648
Like if you're in school and you're giving a test

2021
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:08,928
That's pretty

2022
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,696
Substantial

2023
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:17,632
Reset the population of Latin America is 689 million

2024
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,936
What is the included

2025
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:25,568
The definition of Latin America

2026
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:28,384
The definition of Latin America is a very nebulous thing

2027
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:33,504
If you only consider South America and Central America than the total is 600

2028
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,272
Scream

2029
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,904
You have 177 million living in Central America and 426 million

2030
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,928
Living in South

2031
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:45,280
Now you add the Caribbean to it was you add like Haiti and Cuba

2032
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,072
You come up to 600

2033
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
And

2034
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,656
26 million seventy million

2035
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
Short of

2036
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,192
What he is

2037
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,520
I don't think you're going to be able to get that with weird

2038
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,312
Unaffiliated

2039
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:00,640
Did appear around you know they have populations of like

2040
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,664
6000

2041
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:08,576
If you want to see the difference between 689 million and 626 million isn't

2042
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,856
Special that's fine

2043
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,392
For the fact that he

2044
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:14,720
He's using it to show off how much

2045
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:20,608
China 1.5 billion hundred percent correct because

2046
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,680
Liberals they don't know what to say

2047
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
Comeback

2048
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,008
3 billion

2049
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
200 million

2050
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,896
Women

2051
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:37,504
Right but it's more to the point I think the thing that's more important

2052
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,784
He has these

2053
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,600
Please memorize that are tacky

2054
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:46,464
And it's like a middle schooler trying to pass

2055
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
Cast of Hope

2056
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:51,328
Freaky's close enough

2057
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,864
Conspiracy theorist

2058
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,168
What's going on here baby

2059
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,704
It's not what's going on

2060
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,008
Also you're wrong

2061
01:48:59,264 --> 01:48:59,776
Alex Jones

2062
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,056
Come on.

2063
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,080
You know you know

2064
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:04,896
You know you just want to love

2065
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:05,920
He's wrong

2066
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,712
But in

2067
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,760
That is

2068
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,296
Not as bad as

2069
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,576
Something wrong

2070
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:19,744
Most of the so-called refugees going to Europe or actually not refugees

2071
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:31,264
To investigate

2072
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,544
Old people

2073
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,848
Don't get fingerprinted in Denmark

2074
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:43,296
You want to go to Europe and do you want to go to Germany or Austria for the big bucks the welfare I kid you not

2075
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:58,912
It's admitted they have like hundreds of times increase birth defects

2076
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,960
Villages

2077
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:07,616
Marry your first cousin he was wrong Muhammad was wrong

2078
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:14,016
Wrong sorry guys

2079
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,136
So with a lot and I have a lot of fat

2080
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,160
Wow

2081
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,976
So Alex screamed

2082
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:32,192
Of all Islamic men are on welfare

2083
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:38,592
I did a little bit of research into

2084
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:43,200
Conspiracy theorist Family Security matters. Org

2085
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,272
By a gentleman named Dr Sami

2086
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,552
Call Robbie

2087
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:52,160
Kiara Timebomb

2088
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:57,024
I found some other articles that were talking about

2089
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,352
Percent figure of Muslim man in Europe on welfare

2090
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,472
Now what it is

2091
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:06,496
Germination

2092
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,032
It appears that way

2093
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:12,128
No I don't know there might be some other thing I'm missing but it appears that everything

2094
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
All roads

2095
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,432
Lead back to Rome as it were

2096
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:17,504
This article has literally no citation

2097
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,088
No links to study

2098
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,160
It only has quotes from people that

2099
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
Maybe

2100
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,464
Telling the truth

2101
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
Sightings

2102
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:36,704
So this guy says that

2103
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,472
Turkish immigrants

2104
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:40,544
In Germany have a regular job by 20%

2105
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,616
The other 80% live on the so-called hearts for

2106
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,896
State social benefit

2107
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,712
70% of their children have no education

2108
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,064
Now the argument

2109
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,976
That there's a scam going on

2110
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,792
The come in and for every child that they have

2111
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,096
They get a certain amount from the state

2112
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:10,496
Very similar argument to one that was made about welfare Queens

2113
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:16,384
How this pervasive lie would be used against any part

2114
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,920
Or any parcel

2115
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,456
Of immigrant population

2116
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,088
Large group of ass

2117
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,880
To vote against their own in

2118
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,928
Interest or even support things that are just

2119
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:29,952
Insane

2120
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,488
Like any number of genocide

2121
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,512
Set of occurred over the

2122
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,096
Let's talk about the Turks which again

2123
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,632
He is siding that

2124
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,912
All Muslims

2125
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,936
In all of Europe

2126
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,728
And this article is only talk

2127
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,776
Talking about Germany

2128
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:50,176
And it doesn't really have anything

2129
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,248
It has quotes from people

2130
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,088
Like this

2131
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:02,976
So amazing

2132
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,256
Can afford to buy a house

2133
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,304
Or department and drive luxurious cars

2134
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,840
Like Mercedes or BMW

2135
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:15,264
It's a first name

2136
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,544
There's no way

2137
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
I will trust

2138
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
What about

2139
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,664
I'm sorry

2140
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:25,504
Call kinskey

2141
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,272
Anyway

2142
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:30,880
You get my point back they have just first name people who are anonymous

2143
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,160
Random sources

2144
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:36,000
Interesting story of the music Queen

2145
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:40,096
Immigrants coming in

2146
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,936
Shoddy journalism

2147
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:48,544
I don't want to say this to this is on Family Security matters. Org

2148
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:51,104
We looked at their Twitter feed

2149
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,896
Their most recent tweet

2150
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:57,248
I was a frustrated Israeli

2151
01:53:57,504 --> 01:54:02,112
Defense minister criticized the UN for ignoring the issue of Palestinians killing Palestinians

2152
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,416
Yeah that's a really big

2153
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,952
That's a really big issue right now

2154
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:13,376
You definitely don't want to worry about the Israelis committing

2155
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:16,448
Across that Palestinian

2156
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:20,288
You don't know they're not talking about that

2157
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,336
The killing people

2158
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:30,784
We get thesaurus

2159
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,552
That way

2160
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,344
This is a website

2161
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:35,648
Is really inside a

2162
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:39,744
Especially seems to be

2163
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,120
Again I can't say definitively that's where all of its coming from but it seems like most of the articles that I could find

2164
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:46,656
Link back to this article

2165
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,448
It again had no evidence

2166
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,008
Outside of unattributed quotes

2167
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,312
So I can't I can't go on

2168
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,848
That 80% number

2169
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,616
Can't

2170
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
Can't do it

2171
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:57,920
I just can't

2172
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,200
So then

2173
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,736
We get into

2174
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,016
All of the deep

2175
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,808
All the child

2176
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:10,208
100% child 100% what number what magnificently

2177
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,256
Pittzarella

2178
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,072
That's what the

2179
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,448
Jordan

2180
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,520
Is rooted

2181
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,056
Deep-seated White

2182
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
Goddamn

2183
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:31,968
Phucumol

2184
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
Maybe

2185
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,808
I have two things to purse this bubba

2186
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,856
First thing is some statistics

2187
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,392
From the March of Dimes

2188
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:44,000
From communitarian organization

2189
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,280
I don't know if you knew that

2190
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,376
The instance of

2191
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:52,192
Child is about 3%

2192
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
United

2193
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:57,312
Is about 6% around the world

2194
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:58,592
Most of this has to

2195
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,128
To do with malnutrition

2196
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,736
A lot of it has to do with a lot of countries not having access to vaccines

2197
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,576
I'm at one of the other things

2198
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,856
When you talk about defect

2199
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,720
Just because it's a really big umbrella term it can mean a cleft palate

2200
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,256
Which is not like it's nothing

2201
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,280
That's just bad

2202
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:22,656
It's it's not as severe as some other birth

2203
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,472
So all that gets lumped in together

2204
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:27,776
The 6% can be a jarring number

2205
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:33,664
But when you get down to it some of them are things that are easily treatable and some things are

2206
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,480
It's not still not a

2207
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,760
Still not a relative

2208
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,528
Quality

2209
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:40,832
Would call a ray

2210
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Not

2211
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,416
Doesn't matter

2212
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:47,232
It doesn't matter if the it doesn't matter if the birthday

2213
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,024
Population of the world is

2214
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:49,792
10%

2215
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:51,328
If you are pointing to a

2216
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,400
And calling

2217
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,680
Them the group of

2218
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:57,984
Most genetic

2219
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,032
Never going to be Bass

2220
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,360
And it's always going

2221
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,920
F****** Venom

2222
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,736
But I'm just a liberal

2223
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
That's all I'm just trying to bring

2224
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,064
These days

2225
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:19,232
Conspiracy look like you secretly want to be dominated by an Islamic

2226
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,256
Play Secret

2227
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:26,912
And he's like Muhammad said you can marry your cousin

2228
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,704
You talk about it

2229
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:29,984
I know

2230
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,544
As a liberal cuck

2231
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,104
Just wants to be loved by the

2232
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:35,872
Islam

2233
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:36,896
Estate

2234
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,200
I don't like to hear one more

2235
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:43,040
Well here's the second prong of my busting of the

2236
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:45,088
This bubble is it that Muhammad

2237
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:45,856
Didn't say that

2238
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,416
18

2239
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:53,536
He did say you should marry your first cousin

2240
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:01,984
Bingo Genesis

2241
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,288
Genesis 4:17 cane

2242
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,056
Heather wife

2243
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:08,128
Though there's no account given where his wife comes from

2244
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,200
Accepting direct creation from God

2245
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:15,040
And that area contain groups of people not mentioned in the Bible

2246
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:19,648
Possibilities for her that she is either a full sister of Cain

2247
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,440
Or that you was Cain's Mother E

2248
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:23,744
The later generation of

2249
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,512
Descendants

2250
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:27,840
Because time was really weird in the Bible and people dislike 900

2251
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:30,656
And Elijah

2252
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,680
Still isn't dead

2253
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,288
Baby boo boo

2254
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:40,384
Abraham's son Isaac married Rebecca his first cousin once removed

2255
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:43,712
The granddaughter of his father's brother nahor in these

2256
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,784
By the way right in there is brother

2257
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,672
So there's another instance of cousins

2258
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:54,976
Another

2259
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,888
That was Abraham's brother nahor marry his niece

2260
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:04,448
Malachi the daughter of his own brother hwoarang

2261
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:09,312
Like if you took

2262
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:11,872
Eat a religious text

2263
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:18,016
I found a lot of dumbass Jacob married Leah and Rachel were both sisters

2264
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:20,320
They were the daughters of liban

2265
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:26,208
Devon was the brother of Jacob's mother Rebecca this would make Jacob cousins with Leah and Rachel

2266
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,512
Do you know what's the weirdest thing

2267
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,792
So my parents

2268
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:32,096
The

2269
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,120
The hardcore Chris

2270
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:33,888
Christian variety

2271
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,936
And they have sung the song it multiple

2272
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:36,704
Wedding

2273
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,984
That is about

2274
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,288
Isaac

2275
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,336
Burying his cousin

2276
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,360
No point in time

2277
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,128
Did they ever connected

2278
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:47,200
He never quite figure that out

2279
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,480
Lesbian like out

2280
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,576
Or even Onward Christian Soldiers

2281
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,368
News about killing Muslim

2282
01:59:54,624 --> 02:00:00,768
The fourth son of Jacob mistook his daughter-in-law.

2283
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:09,216
You know what I'm saying daughters

2284
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:15,616
Yeah the two daughters f*** their dad because there were no suitable men around him drunk

2285
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:19,712
They got him drunk and onto Max they f***** in to get pregnant

2286
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:24,320
But I mean you know what I'm going to tell you this right now

2287
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,624
Muhammad was wrong when he said that lot should

2288
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,392
The fact his daughter

2289
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:31,488
I mean it is again that just goes to

2290
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:33,792
Cuz I'm that goes is xenophobia

2291
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,328
Because all of these

2292
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:37,120
Since his existing religious text

2293
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,656
Because again we talked about this

2294
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,680
Before they were written

2295
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:40,960
F****** long time ago

2296
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:46,848
I think there's something to be gained from them if you

2297
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:49,408
Approach them with a metaphorical understanding

2298
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,176
If you don't get it

2299
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,200
Who cares

2300
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,760
This is actually what we should end the show with

2301
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:58,112
Okay because it's not good

2302
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,904
Cuz there's

2303
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:06,304
You're giving yourself notes during the show that you're not paying attention I'm saying that we should I'm the show with this because it's how a lot of our shows

2304
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,072
Independent

2305
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:09,376
But there's so much worse

2306
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:11,936
S*** after it that we have to keep discussing it

2307
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,728
But this

2308
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:14,752

02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,544
Just now listen to me

2310
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,592
This is how we would have ended the show

2311
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:20,128
If it hadn't broken badass

2312
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:28,064

But also when you saying that people want to get off the air

2316
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,680
He has to be talkin about

2317
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:49,568

And God slept

2333
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:52,960
That water is got to be run through that filtration

2334
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:53,728
Open system

2335
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:58,848

02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:00,640
Clean my water

2337
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:01,920

02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:08,832
By my filtration

2340
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:21,632
North Korea shipping like super cheerful

2341
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,496
It is very alarming

2342
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:33,152
North Korea or threatening nuclear war

2343
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,176
Really bad

2344
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:41,088
Come out on Monday so who knows what will happen on Sunday but like

2345
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:46,976
The more more I think about it the more I realize that is just two assholes

2346
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:49,792
Kind of normal

2347
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,840
These exercises what's up Korea

2348
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:54,144
Or normal it doesn't happen every year

2349
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,960
The different is we have a lunatic

2350
02:04:57,984 --> 02:05:04,128
That makes it scarier but at the same time it all could not end up going

2351
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:09,248
It's possible both go back and forth on this

2352
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,784
A week ago

2353
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,344
Give me like

2354
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:16,416
I'm afraid this North Korea is going to go down this is the one that does it

2355
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:21,280
All the time

2356
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:24,096
Freaking out and a week ago I was telling you the opposite

2357
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,656
To get on the same page

2358
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:28,960
Alarm

2359
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:32,544
Internally I'm still freaking out a little bit but I just

2360
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,360
I think we can make it out of

2361
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:38,944
I think I should be okay but I don't know what's going to happen next week

2362
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,480
It doesn't just

2363
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:41,760
Become friends

2364
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,040
No it doesn't work

2365
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:43,808
That way

2366
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:44,576
Like I'm

2367
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,856
At this point

2368
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,392
Just like

2369
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,160
Guys

2370
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,184
Pick one

2371
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,232
We're going to have nuclear war

2372
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,280
Don't do the Brinks

2373
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:54,048
Dementia

2374
02:05:54,304 --> 02:06:00,448
Just be like hey either we're going to kill each other or not and then let's move on from stop it with the edge player

2375

And this is nothing

2387
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:33,728
Terrible if you look at that ideas like I'm way to come

2388
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:34,752
Speaking to come

2389
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:35,776
Government

2390
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:40,384
To take all my money

2391
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,152
Alex

2392
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
Dick

2393
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:44,224
Stop trying to get in the transition game

2394
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:45,504
Who's next

2395
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,784
Is really dumb

2396
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:51,136
Another example of Gavin

2397
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:51,904
Dennis

2398
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:54,464
Not having a real story

2399
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,000
Forgiving an anecdotal

2400
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:58,048
Source about something

2401
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,072
The point but doesn't

2402
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:02,400
And then I want to get back on the other side of this

2403
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:03,936
And I do so

2404
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:04,704
School function

2405
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:10,336
Information in America

2406
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:12,384
Are the most red-tailed millennial

2407
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:15,456
In three generations there 15%

2408
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,976
Or white

2409
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:31,584
Yep yep

2410
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:44,128
That was near the Coca-Cola factory I think that's

2411
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,408
Nothing Idaho I can't remember

2412
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,176
But he said

2413
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:48,992
Are about half conservative

2414
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,808
The parents are like 80%

2415
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:55,904
100% of the teachers are hyper hyper left-wing

2416
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:02,304
If you

2417
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:08,448
I wouldn't be allowed to write it like you have to

2418
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,848
Write the assignment that you want

2419
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,152
We have to show education that

2420
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:23,552
The free market of ideas is more dominant than you are hysterical

2421
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,696
Newspaper

2422
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,512
The thing that

2423
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,048
The true Injustice

2424
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,608
Is that they won't publish

2425
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,888
Proton particles

2426
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,472
Truant

2427
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:44,032
I said this about newspapers

2428
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,104
And publish

2429
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:53,760
Is a weird word for an assignment to school and whatever I mean like I don't believe you

2430
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:54,784
Disagree with him like

2431
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,576
If that's what you believe

2432
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:57,344
Rite Aid

2433
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,368
And get enough

2434
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,136
Sure

2435
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,160
To me that has

2436
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:00,928
Has the ring

2437
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:04,256
This is another example of a

2438
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:09,632
Conclusions based on false premises premises wrong there's no way it is like

2439
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:16,288
Oh yeah I know you want to talk about Trump being good you can't do that you know what I

2440
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:18,080
All Things Are

2441
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:20,384
More likely

2442
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:27,808
Parameters

2443
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,624
The fact that you

2444
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,672
Can't wear American flag shirt

2445
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:40,096
Is more to do with you and not because they possibly

2446
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,936
Millennials

2447
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:45,984
Do not skew more conservative

2448
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:49,312
The numbers are actually down

2449
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:51,616
I'm past all the cross

2450
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:52,640
The board pastime

2451
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:57,248
The republican-democrat party affiliation numbers hipoteca

2452
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,528
Actually

2453
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,552
As the

2454
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:06,720
Dependence

2455
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,000
I witches

2456
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,280
I think that's hard

2457
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:13,632
Do we

2458
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,448
Fiddle back and forth more liberal than

2459
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:22,848
Mainly we're not beholden to the Democrats

2460
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:26,432
Many times I think I would I would say we're more Progressive

2461
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,504
Angry

2462
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:32,320
Very much as the difference

2463
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:37,696
That is wrong I'm lying about that's just a lie

2464
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:42,816
The Pew Research Center has a very in-depth polls about millennial

2465
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:45,120
Party affiliation party leading

2466
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:46,144
Those are two things

2467
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:49,984
It's far more democratic and Independence

2468
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:53,568
Could be libertarian like

2469
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,592
Yeah

2470
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:56,640
But

2471
02:10:56,896 --> 02:11:00,992
Now about Generation Z

2472
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:06,112
What's Generation Z I haven't heard that was under millennial

2473
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:07,648
Yeah and

2474
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:08,416
The underboss

2475
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:11,744
Is a population that is very difficult

2476
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,512
Forget

2477
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:14,560
Statistical information

2478
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:15,840
Fright

2479
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:17,376
They don't have

2480
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,192
I've never voted before

2481
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:22,496
There's not fully formed

2482
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:23,776
Adulthood in

2483
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,824
OMG

2484
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,104
The six-year-old who feel like

2485
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:31,712
It's incredibly difficult to get demographic information about them

2486
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,248
In terms of their political

2487
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:34,784
Of course however

2488
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:38,112
There was one that was done

2489
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:44,000
Just because it's the Hispanic heritage

2490
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:46,048
I was going to say

2491
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:47,328
Say that I'm just saying for the audience

2492
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:48,608
Just in case

2493
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,888
The word is a second

2494
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:54,240
Study of 14 to 18 year old high schooler

2495
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:57,824
Old 5000

2496
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,384
50000

2497
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,152
Students

2498
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:04,992
They found overall

2499
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:06,528
34%

2500
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:07,552
We're in favor of

2501
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,112
20% were in favor of clay

2502
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:11,904
31%

2503
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:13,952
Said they would not choose to vote in this

2504
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:19,840
So that's overall

2505
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,376
Over

2506
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,192
Obama's job approval rating

2507
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:25,728
41% approve

2508
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:27,264
25% disappear

2509
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,312
No opinion 28

2510
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,592
Cuz their

2511
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:33,152
Direction of country

2512
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:34,432
Positive

2513
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,456
7%

2514
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:36,480
Negative

2515
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,504
5540

2516
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,296
Smart kids don't know

2517
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,064
34

2518
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:41,600
Smart kids

2519
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:44,928
Can you get back

2520
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,744
Alright big Gavin's argument

2521
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,048
That Generation Z loves Trump

2522
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:51,328
Nonsense

2523
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:55,424
Then I would prefer

2524
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,216
This

2525
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:02,080
34% favorability 20% favorability for Clinton out of the overall

2526
02:13:02,336 --> 02:13:04,128
And say that means

2527
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:05,408
There's an overwhelming

2528
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,688
Conservative

2529
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:10,016
Uprising what's going on they love Trump nationalism

2530
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:14,368
Unfortunately

2531
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,136
There would be

2532
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,416
These are children

2533
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:17,952
Greatly in

2534
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:20,512
And your trampoline

2535
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:21,792
Are going to be

2536
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:22,816
Much more

2537
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:23,840
Domineering

2538
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:25,120
In regards to what it is

2539
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:29,472
Can I do a better job than you explaining this

2540
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:30,752
Read the rest

2541
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:33,824
Can I borrow the rest

2542
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:39,200
Daybreak Netflix

2543
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:41,760
They break down the statistics even more

2544
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:45,344
Among African-American respondents

2545
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,648
7% Trump

2546
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,440
47% Clinton

2547
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:54,048
33 would not choose

2548
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,072
Well

Percent Trump 31% Clinton

2555
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,640
Now we get down to

2556
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:09,664
What

2557
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,456
Do you think the numbers on white folk

2558
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:14,272
Let's get

2559
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:16,576
They specifically broke down

2560
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:18,368
The difference between white male

2561
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:20,672
And none else

2562
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:21,696
White males

2563
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:23,232
58%

2564
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:26,304

2567
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:31,168
I would not choose to vote

2568
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,984

16% disapprove kill us all

2578
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,440
That's a very big

2579
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:55,488
Safari bags

2580
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,768

02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:59,328
Percent approval rating among white males

2582
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:01,888
A percent

2583
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,192
Do you know what's crazy about the show

2584
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,216
What's up

2585
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:10,336
For somebody who rails against white genocide so much he's the best reason

2586
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:11,104
For Wyatt

2587
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:16,480
But you know what he does he uses arguments and then doesn't engage with the rest of the fact

2588
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:17,504
In that argument

2589
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,320
Did prove that he's wrong of course it's insane

2590
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:22,112
It is truly insane

2591
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:23,136
Distance

2592
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:24,160
Tire listen

2593
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,184
Episode

2594
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,720
Has been about him

2595
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:29,280
That all of the

2596
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
The people

2597
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:31,328
Most damage

2598
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:32,864
He believes

2599
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:33,888
Secretly

2600
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:36,704
Mulatto

2601
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,472
Suggestive

2602
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:39,008
They use

2603
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:42,080
Evil s*** that they do is that

2604
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:42,848
Secretly

2605
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,128
Everyone Acts

2606
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:45,408
Actually wants it

2607
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,968
The fact that they

2608
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:49,248
The system is

2609
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:51,040
Is built around 2

2610
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:51,808
Supporting this

2611
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,576
Miserable

2612
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:55,904
Is evident that

2613
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,440
The miserable ideology

2614
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:58,720
Should be what

2615
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:06,144
What the actual study says and all the rest of the

2616
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:06,912
Breakdown

2617
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:07,936
You could say

2618
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:08,704
The youth

2619
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,240
Are super into Trump

2620
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:16,896
And what the reality is it's most likely

2621
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:20,992
And it is women are also

2622
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:21,760
Fairly

2623
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:27,904
It is white

2624
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:28,672
People

2625
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:31,488
Genetically engineered by youku pants

2626
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,024
Race somehow Trump

2627
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,352
Anyway

2628
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:37,376
This next

2629
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:39,168
Lieu of

2630
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:43,264
Starting fluid there's this blue I think coming up

2631
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,032
Veyron

2632
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:52,480
Oh okay

2633
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,528
Clips or so

2634
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:55,808
Are all

2635
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:57,088
Bigotry

2636
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:59,904
They're all just bigotry straight

2637
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,464
That they don't understand is dumb

2638
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,256
They don't understand it the bigoted

2639
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,304
We'll just take it as a come

2640
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:07,584
Take a note

2641
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:15,520
Even the liberal colleges high schools have giant we need more families

2642
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,544
Why

2643
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,848
Kids are 14

2644
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:22,944
Walked into a group of fifth graders and said

2645
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:25,760
I'm going to teach you how to have sex

2646
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,880
We need more white family

2647
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:38,304
They are gone so far left

2648
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:43,424
I had a sex ed class in sixth grade that's one year off of his 5th grade assessment

2649
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:45,728
Praising it

2650
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:50,080
If some heterosexual just wandered in off the street

2651
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:54,688
Do we need more

2652
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:56,224
I think it's probably something like

2653
02:17:57,248 --> 02:18:00,320
Respect

2654
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:20,544
That's the shirt

2655
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:26,176
Christian holiday

2656
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:28,992
Free water filtration

2657
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:31,040
If this damn if you buy our

2658
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:33,344
How do we clean up our beer numbers

2659
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:39,488
But that's just like straw man

2660
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:44,864
It's getting mad about nothing

2661
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:49,984
And like you chose the wrong year to be like fifth grade cuz that is right around would help classes

2662
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:54,080
They put a condom on a banana and s*** like that

2663
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:58,944
Every school teach you how to have like they're like okay you want to be in missionary

2664
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:00,480
Short. Of time

2665
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:06,112
Now that's usually better but communicate

2666
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,136
With your partner

2667
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,184
Maybe she's into some BDSM s***

2668
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:11,232
Like

2669
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:17,632
They don't teach about like ass play

2670
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:23,520
But you know that y'all have better lives if everybody was being

2671
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:27,616
You know the reason they have to do that isn't about the age.

2672
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:30,944
Puberty and sexual maturity

2673
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:31,712
Chappelle kids

2674
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:32,736
About that sir

2675
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:37,600
Probably a good idea never speak about it at all

2676
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:38,368
Somebody

2677
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,184
Good morning

2678
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,280
I'm sorry Jordan

2679
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:48,096
Sorry that your birth was prophesied

2680
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:03,200
Are are at risk

2681
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:05,248
And gays are hiding in their home

2682
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,784
Scared of being killed

2683
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:12,160
They are horrible welcome

2684
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:18,560
Welcome Nigel McGuinness to the season brings a cowboy

2685
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:21,632
Will agree with it for the rest of the show

2686
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:22,656
He's joined us

2687
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:28,032
He's going to fight against Trump's America where gay people are huddling because they're afraid of what's going to happen

2688
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:35,456
As many overtures against the gay community necessarily

2689
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:36,480
In terms of

2690
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:37,504
What is policies

2691
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:41,600
Just a DLP being bold

2692
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,392
Set the problem

2693
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:44,928
But

2694
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:48,000
He really f***** up by choosing disabilities

2695
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,280
As one of them

2696
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:51,072
Because of

2697
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:52,864
Because of Betsy DeVos

2698
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:56,704
Who is Betsy DeVos who's the Secretary of Education

2699
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,728
What is

2700
02:20:57,984 --> 02:20:59,264
She's really into voucher

2701
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,032
Program

2702
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:03,360
Here's one of the things that people don't

2703
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:05,152
Standby Voucher Program

2704
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:07,968
I'm taking this from americanprogress.org

2705
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,248
A very

2706
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:11,040
In-depth very well site

2707
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:12,320
Article about the

2708
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:14,368
To participate many voucher

2709
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:18,720
Programs parents must all of the protections and right

2710
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:20,000
Under federal law

2711
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:23,584
What's more some states are not transparent about the stipulation

2712
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,888
For example Florida's McKay Scholarship

2713
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:26,656
Choir students

2714
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:28,704
Described above

2715
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:32,800
And that condition is not clearly stated in the information available to parents

2716
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:33,568
The state's website

2717
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,384
No one they say the information cited above

2718
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,944
They're talking about special needs

2719
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,736
The talking about the Americans at

2720
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:41,504
Disability Act

2721
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:44,832
They're talkin about the need

2722
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:46,880
Situation

2723
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,160
To where somebody is dead

2724
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:49,952
Thank God I forfeited my

2725
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:53,024
No I am not off hand

2726
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:57,120
Positive

2727
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:58,912
Jesus

2728
02:21:59,168 --> 02:22:02,240
If I hadn't forfeited those rights that I have

2729
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:10,944
School

2730
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:14,016
Is the right to a free and appropriate public at

2731
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:16,832
Would really have that right

2732
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:19,136
Going to get an education

2733
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:21,184
The free inappropriate part

2734
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,208
Super bored

2735
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:23,744
School

2736
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,512
Entails

2737
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:31,168
Schools must evaluate children who they suspect to have a disability classify their disability in developing individualized education

2738
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,960
Program an IEP

2739
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:33,984
Describing

2740
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:38,080
The appropriate placement and services that will help the children meet grade level standard

2741
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:41,408
Some IEPs prescribed minimal services or combination

2742
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,944
Such as additional time

2743
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:43,968
Complete assignments

2744
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:45,504
Well others include

2745
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:46,784
Such as this

2746
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,320
Sports on 1A

2747
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:51,392
Iep's must be re-evaluated on an annual basis

2748
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:52,416
Sister determine if the students

2749
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:55,488
A new Supportive Services are required

2750
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,048
This is part of the Federal Protection

2751
02:22:58,304 --> 02:22:59,328
For disabled

2752
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,888
This is one of the things that you waive away

2753
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:02,912
In about 4 Pro

2754
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:03,936
You shouldn't wave that

2755
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:05,984
No because very important

2756
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:06,752
It's superb

2757
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:07,520
Because

2758
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:11,616
The idea of what a Disabled Student is also really

2759
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,176
It could be someone within mild

2760
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:16,224
Behavioral problem

2761
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,504
Or it could be someone with Down

2762
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:19,808
It could be someone in a wheelchair

2763
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,880
They're all sorts of things that fall under that category zacian

2764
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:25,440
Now within the voucher programs also

2765
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,208
Because

2766
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,744
We know it makes it

2767
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:29,536
Difficult to deal with these

2768
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:31,328
Did you have to create these iup

2769
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,120
Is individual education

2770
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:35,936
Because the federal law demands that

2771
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:39,264
Is public school or private school

2772
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,592
Can just deny stood

2773
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:46,688
New Bern to our school we can't handle this

2774
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,736
Or whatever they can just say

2775
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:50,016
We don't we don't want

2776
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:52,320
We do we can just reject you as a student

2777
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:53,344
Which is

2778
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:54,624
Really scary

2779
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:57,696
That's a really scary world we could be entering into

2780
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:59,744
And it's exactly what

2781
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,304
The person that Trump has made the Secretary of Education

2782
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:03,328
Wants to do

2783
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:06,144
It's his vision of education for the future

2784
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:06,912
So

2785
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:08,448
Nigel McGuinness

2786
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:13,056
With your thing is like oh my God these people with disabilities are going to be screwed

2787
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:14,080
What kind of car

2788
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:18,176
They absolutely it's going to be

2789
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:19,712
This isn't some weird

2790
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:21,504
Spear this is based on facts

2791
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:22,272
Is based on

2792
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:24,576
Rejection of the federal

2793
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:29,440
Standards that are made

2794
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:30,720
She said that

2795
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:32,512
Directions for disabled students

2796
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:34,560
Answer be handled on a state-by-state basis

2797
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:37,376
Not recognizing that these are federal mandates

2798
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:39,936
The Americans with Disability Act

2799
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:41,216
And the idea Act

2800
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:43,520
Are both Federal Sanford

2801
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:44,288
The fattest

2802
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,056
Fetishize

2803
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:46,592
State-by-state

2804
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:51,712
What why would a

2805
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,528
What one state wants to

2806
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,552
To do with this

2807
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:56,832
Disabled

2808
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:00,928
Stay 302 gerrymander

2809
02:25:02,208 --> 02:25:02,976
Wouldn't you

2810
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:05,792
Why would you why would you trade

2811
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:07,072
Why would you want

2812
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,096
Disabled kids tube

2813
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:10,912
Retreated

2814
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:12,960
Oh you don't actually want that

2815
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,984
You want

2816
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:17,312
Businesses to make as much money as possible and you want things

2817
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:20,128
Do not cost that much

2818
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:22,432
I know that I know the underlined

2819
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,712
The reason

2820
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:26,272
What is your possible like just

2821
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:27,808
Human

2822
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:30,112
Explanation for why

2823
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:34,464
The state-by-state part is that states are much easier to control Legend

2824
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,512
Slated leave than the Federal

2825
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:44,192
Even on the Democratic side Illinois super your

2826
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,216
Sinister

2827
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:47,008
Because that's the reality

2828
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:49,056
Communicate

2829
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:50,080
With their proper

2830
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:51,872
Where's the compassion

2831
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:53,408
Possibly silver

2832
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,712
What

2833
02:25:55,968 --> 02:25:56,736
What possible

2834
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:58,272
Could you say that

2835
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:02,368
Do you want disabled people also

2836
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:03,904
2 Estates

2837
02:26:05,184 --> 02:26:06,464
Oroville

2838
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,232
Free market

2839
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,256
Situation where

2840
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:10,816
If Illinois treat their disabled

2841
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:12,352
Kids better more disabled

2842
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:13,888
Move to Illinois

2843
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:14,912
And that means that

2844
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,680
What

2845
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,704
What

2846
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:19,008
Simple benefit could be

2847
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,032
By making it

2848
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,056
States

2849
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:21,824
Right

2850
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:28,736
Well because I have to speculate cuz I'm not really in that head and I think that is insane

2851
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:32,832
I would save it possibly their argument would be that

2852
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:33,856
If

2853
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,648
Please disable kids

2854
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:36,928
Stop getting such a fuk

2855
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:37,696
Confirm

2856
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:39,232
We'll have to work harder

2857
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:40,512
And they will

2858
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:42,048
Learn how to succeed

2859
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:45,120
Doing coddling these disabled kids for too long

2860
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:51,776
In the same way

2861
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:53,312
Like that

2862
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,592
I think that most

2863
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,128
Like

2864
02:26:56,896 --> 02:27:00,224
I would not think it's too far bridge to cross

2865
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,504
For us to save it

2866
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:05,344
Possibly they don't believe a lot of these disabilities are real

2867
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,904
Amateur people are forced to stop faking it

2868
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,440
Perception

2869
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:13,792
Then all this autism will go away August

2870
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:16,608
So it's that kind of b******* like

2871
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:18,400
Is the kid

2872
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:19,680
You weren't called Ada

2873
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:20,448
PhD

He recalled

2875
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,496
Bright

2876
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,776
That whole

2877
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,056
Brett

2878
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:26,592
If you just

2879
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:28,128
If you just ignore this

2880
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:28,896
Kind of

2881
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:29,920
Situation

2882
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:31,456
Then you'll be

2883
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:32,224
Forester

2884
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:32,992
Assimilated

2885
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,808
Somewhat yeah

2886
02:27:38,112 --> 02:27:38,880
You are

2887
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:40,416
You are what

2888
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:43,232
Validating it you're supporting it

2889
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:44,000
I don't know

2890
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:45,792
Doesn't

2891
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:48,352
It doesn't give now entered the area where

2892
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:54,240
I can't further defend it with a hypothetical cuz I don't know I don't know

2893
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:56,544
This is all

2894
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:57,312
Business

2895
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,176

Institutionalized

2897
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:07,808
Separate

2898
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:09,856
The federal government from the states

2899
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:12,160
Is just a masquerade of

2900
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:13,952
We should allow certain

2901
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:15,744
People to be cruel because that's why

2902
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,072
What they believe in

2903
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,608
Did they can't then make that

2904
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,376
At 1

2905
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:22,400
Tiny f******

2906
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:23,936
All of their

2907
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:24,704
Against

2908
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:26,496
There are all of their argument

2909
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:28,288
Islamophobia

2910
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:29,568
Like

2911
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:31,616
Exactly what they're saying

2912
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:36,224
Do Islamic people want to be treated differently based on their cultural ideology

2913
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:36,992
And their beliefs

2914
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:40,832
We you think that that's evil in everybody in America

2915
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:44,416
Should be held to the same standardized American set of values

2916
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:45,696
But at the same time

2917
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:50,048
American set of values should be separated between the federal government and

2918
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:54,912
The States government really what you're saying is that Alabama right

2919
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:56,448
Should be different from

2920
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:58,240
F****** Islamic

2921
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:02,336
Different from f****** Illinois right2know a made-up

2922
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:03,360
Nonsense

02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:05,408
B******* way of saying

2924
02:29:06,688 --> 02:29:07,200
Don't

2925
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:12,320
And act

2926
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:13,600
Exactly like

2927
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:15,648
Somewhat yeah

2928
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:18,720
If you do not

2929
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:21,280
F****** commit to that reality

2930
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:22,048
Stepbet

2931
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:24,608

Possible

2944
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:49,952
Reasonable explanation

2945
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:55,328
Now that's a fun thought that you just gave me through that ramp

2946
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:56,864
No that was great

2947
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:09,664
Google is taking away all of our money percent off of

Feel like a

2950
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:20,928
One of the fun thoughts that came to me during that rent was that like

2951
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:22,720
Now let's say

2952
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,768
Apropos of nothing

2953
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,864
Arkansas decided they wanted Sharia law

2954
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:30,656

Like it

2958
02:30:36,288 --> 02:30:39,104
That's a white people

2959
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:42,176
Arkansas said I we want Sharia law

2960
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:43,456
States rights

2961
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:48,832

02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:15,776
If they're beating us

3004
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:16,800
They're beating our

3005
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:17,568
Regular web

3006
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:23,712
I hate it

3007
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:24,736
When

3008
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:25,504
I'm watching

3009
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,832
And I see a guy wearing a wig

3010
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:30,880
Like that movie

3011
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:32,672
Guy wear a wig

3012
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:33,952
Alright

3013
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:36,256
I want I want to make

3014
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:37,280
One point

3015
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:38,304
Crystal clear

3016
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:40,864
I think that there is an interesting

3017
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:43,168
Discussion that will have to come up

3018
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,704
In terms of Trans Am

3019
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:47,008
Because in terms of

3020
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:51,360
Musculature and endosorb things it isn't interesting

3021
02:33:53,408 --> 02:33:54,688
You know the purity of the turf

3022
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:56,736
Kind of argument

3023
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:57,760
Very minor

3024
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:07,744
That part I get I get where I was coming from but it's so

3025
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:10,048
It's not even tertiary its way Beyonce

3026
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:15,424
In the

3027
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:17,984
Women should be represented

3028
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:22,592
Their draw at professional softball game

3029
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:26,688
Like men drama for baseball

3030
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:32,320
This is all that we need to know about gender now let's let's take a step

3031
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:36,416
And get into Nigel's argument where he's like

3032
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:39,488
So the Liberals try black

3033
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:41,792
But they weren't in on the gay agenda

3034
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:43,328
Trans

3035
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:46,400
And people are just mentally ill gay people

3036
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,936
We don't want that

3037
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:50,240
What are you talkin about what is he

3038
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:52,544
That's not based on anything

3039
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:53,824
I don't

3040
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,104
I can't understand

3041
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,896
Liberals still very much

3042
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:59,456
Support African American

3043
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:01,248
Yeah there's not abandoned

3044
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:05,088
Anybody also black community as a whole isn't against gay people

3045
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:07,648
Nope that's an absurd premise

3046
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:11,488
The idea that trans people are now the New Black

3047
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:13,024
Stupid and productive

3048
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:16,608
The idea that trans people are mentally ill gays

3049
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:17,888
Is offensive

3050
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:19,424
Idiot

3051
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,448
You're just a

3052
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:22,496
F****** idiot Gavin

3053
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,032
Grow up

3054
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,056
It is

3055
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,360
It is it is this

3056
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:31,968
Boys love it

3057
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:34,784
For us to engage with

3058
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:36,832
Sure because then we have to

3059
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:39,648
To that is now

3060
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:40,672
We are

3061
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,024
When would it really

3062
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,304
Is

3063
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,072
I don't give a

3064
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:47,840
F***

3065
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:49,120
If your

3066
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:50,144
Crest

3067
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:51,680
That's a big D

3068
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:56,544
It doesn't matter if if there's

3069
02:35:57,312 --> 02:36:00,384
Like because what he's what he's trying to do is like

3070
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:01,920
Conflate

3071
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:02,944
The fact that there is a

3072
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:03,712
Cause

3073
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:04,992
Du jour

3074
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:06,784
You know like

3075
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,576
Right now

3076
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:09,600
When you look at North

3077
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:10,368
Carolina

3078
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,392
Your first thought

3079
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,440
We need to stop them from doing

3080
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:14,464
Trans bathroom

3081
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:15,488
Right

3082
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:18,048
That does not mean that I have

3083
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:19,840
Change my mind on whether or not

3084
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,120
Go Cops

3085
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:23,424
Black people

3086
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:24,448
Port Orchard

3087
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:25,472
Which is what

3088
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:29,056
Under the umbrella

3089
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:29,824
Of

3090
02:36:33,152 --> 02:36:33,664
Suppress

3091
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:34,944
All of these

3092
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:36,736
Because again

3093
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:37,760
They don't look

3094
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:38,784
And act

3095
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:42,624
Well what it comes down to two is this idea that

3096
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,392
Themes

3097
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,928
Like sacrilege to

3098
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:45,952
People like

3099
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:48,768
Keep multiple thoughts in our heads

3100
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:51,584
It's not really difficult to be

3101
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:55,680
Worried about the oppression of trans people and black people

3102
02:36:55,936 --> 02:36:56,448
At the same time

3103
02:36:56,704 --> 02:37:02,336
And then throw Hispanics in there to throw everybody in there

3104
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,360
The same

3105
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:06,432
Yep it is it is tendrils

3106
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,712
Fatima prayer

3107
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,248
And the

3108
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:10,272
Problem is

3109
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:11,552
That it is very much

3110
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:12,576
War that is

3111
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,112
Multiple free

3112
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:16,928
So no matter where it is that

3113
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:18,208
Depression is hitting

3114
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,280
And it just so happens that

3115
02:37:21,536 --> 02:37:22,048
Unfortunate

3116
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:25,120
We're influenced by the

3117
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:28,448
The media the news of the day and I don't mean like the

3118
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:30,752
The news media so much as

3119
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:33,056
Somebody

3120
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:34,336
And it makes it on

3121
02:37:35,104 --> 02:37:36,128
And then there's

3122
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,152
10 million

3123
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:39,200
Who have to respond

3124
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:40,736
Daily basis

3125
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:42,528
Fortunate

3126
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:43,296
We can't smoke

3127
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:44,064
PS4

3128
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:46,112
For a full year

3129
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:50,208
Imagine if everyone liberals could do triage

3130
02:37:50,464 --> 02:37:52,000
Everyone's addicted to doing hot tape

3131
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:57,376
Or here's my pain about this social ill or whatever you know yeah

3132
02:37:58,144 --> 02:38:00,704
If we could if we can

3133
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:01,472
Like hey

3134
02:38:01,728 --> 02:38:03,008
The first thing we need to do

3135
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:05,056
And all of these other play

3136
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:06,336
Serious

3137
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:07,360
Real

3138
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:08,384
Devastate

3139
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:10,688
But the first thing we need to do

3140
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:11,712
Is

3141
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:12,992
Kathy kuo

3142
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:13,760
Cool pay for equal

3143
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:16,832
Just focused on that

3144
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:18,368
Just every single person

3145
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:19,904
Every single day

3146
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:22,464
The only thing we do the only thing we talked about

3147
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,000
Is this until a

3148
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:26,816
Then we go to the next

3149
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:28,608
Then we go to the next thing

3150
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:30,144
If we could do this triage

3151
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:32,704
Because that's what the GOP does better than

3152
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:36,288
Anybody out but certainly true

3153
02:38:36,544 --> 02:38:37,056
Focus

3154
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:38,592
Fixate on one thing

3155
02:38:39,104 --> 02:38:40,384
And that's all they talk about

3156
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:41,920
Anti-abortion

3157
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:43,200
Fixate on

3158
02:38:43,968 --> 02:38:45,248
Restricting women's rights

3159
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:46,528
To the point where

3160
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:48,832
It's at the healthcare law

3161
02:38:49,088 --> 02:38:50,112
The f****** tax

3162
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:54,720
Code the f****** military budget

3163
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:55,744
Them trying

3164
02:38:56,256 --> 02:38:59,584
Can I make an argument for why it's

3165
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:04,192
Kind of impossible for liberals to do that united front

3166
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:07,264
I think it's impossible is most

3167
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,288
Of the issues

3168
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,824
That are being discussed

3169
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,616
Or legitimately life-and-death

3170
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:13,408
Different community

3171
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:20,064
Especially trans women of color are getting murdered a ton

3172
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:23,648
All of a lot of trans youth are committing suicide

3173
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:26,464
It's not negotiable for them to be like

3174
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:29,024
Oh yeah let's get the pay Gap get down

3175
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,072
It's difficult for them

3176
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:34,144
To be like this has to be our number one issue with life-and-death

3177
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,704
I meant about the African-American Community were like

3178
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:38,240
Cops keep killing

3179
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:41,568
I'm beating the s*** out of us when we do nothing

3180
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:45,920
Agreed and it's difficult to switch Focus for them off of that

3181
02:39:46,688 --> 02:39:49,760
That's what becomes very difficult there are five issues

3182
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:55,648
Legitimately on the left for all of these communities

3183
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:56,416
We focus on

3184
02:39:56,672 --> 02:40:01,280
You're absolutely right

3185
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:04,864
Issue arbitrarily you didn't mean that specifically be the first one

3186
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,888
No thank you

3187
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:07,936
But like that's why it's difficult

3188
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:10,752
Consensus and unified

3189
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:13,056
There are a bunch of

3190
02:40:13,312 --> 02:40:14,080
Allied

3191
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:15,616
Causes

3192
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:16,896
That have like

3193
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:17,920
Just

3194
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:20,480
Death and of course the reason that the

3195
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:21,248
The GOP can

3196
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:23,552
Cuz it is

3197
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:24,576
White people

3198
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:26,368
And because they're fighting again

3199
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:29,696
You know like you said text

3200
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:31,488
Code

3201
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:37,888
Elvis sing imaginary enemy block of the same

3202
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:40,704
The left left is a block of

3203
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,472
Everybody

3204
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:42,752
And they're fighting

3205
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:44,032
4 lives

3206
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:46,080
Whereas most of the time

3207
02:40:46,336 --> 02:40:47,872
The right is fighting for

3208
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:51,968
I don't want to make a cake for a gay dude for I want to save money

3209
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:55,808
It's much easier to team up when those are your issues

3210
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:57,600
It's harder when you have

3211
02:40:58,112 --> 02:40:59,136
Blocks of people

3212
02:40:59,392 --> 02:41:01,696
I mean I mean really what it comes down to

3213
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:02,720
Is we have

3214
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:04,512
The most corrupt government

3215
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:05,792
In the history of the

3216
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:08,096
Because some people

3217
02:41:09,888 --> 02:41:11,936
Yeah that's really what it comes down to

3218
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:18,336
To be fair so we're not super easily attack of bulshit wasn't like it wasn't perfect under Obama

3219
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:23,968
Either they're still

3220
02:41:24,224 --> 02:41:25,760
Immediately following the crisis

3221
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:26,784
He didn't

3222
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,088
F****** execute any number of different

3223
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:33,696
Controls that we haven't seen much of the dogs attack of fever

3224
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:34,464
If governments

3225
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,744
Commit

3226
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:36,512
F******

3227
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:37,280
War crimes

3228
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:38,560
Against countries that

3229
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:39,328
That we have no pain

3230
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:41,120
Without Congressional

3231
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:42,400
So of course

3232
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:44,704
Trump is going to abuse these very same

3233
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:47,520
Things that Obama himself

3234
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:48,288
Led to

3235
02:41:48,544 --> 02:41:50,080
I understand that

3236
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:51,104
Yeah

3237
02:41:51,872 --> 02:41:52,384
Truly

3238
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:54,432
So a lot of the mistakes

3239
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:56,992
Obama has made

3240
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:58,016
Comeback

3241
02:41:58,272 --> 02:41:58,784
Vitae

3242
02:41:59,040 --> 02:41:59,552
Sinoway

3243
02:41:59,808 --> 02:42:01,856
Because none of us ever expected

3244
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:03,904
Trump president

3245
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,976
Slim Chickens came home to roost

3246
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:09,536
So we have it let's get through some of these clips

3247
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:11,840
Let's just do it

3248
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:17,728
They keep screaming at me you need to love me more you need to explain need to bake me a cake for my

3249
02:42:17,984 --> 02:42:18,752
He's talking about the game

3250
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:19,520
Yeah

3251
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:21,568
And I go

3252
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:27,968
We're not homophobic you don't care when I get up there was Liberace dancing around with his ring then we had Paul

3253
02:42:28,224 --> 02:42:34,368
Call Linda

3254
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:39,232
I got with men

3255
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:40,512
Love me

3256
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:52,032
Abject jellyfish they're all into their pity party

3257
02:42:55,872 --> 02:43:01,760
So they went black.

3258
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:06,368
First of all that's involved understand today

3259
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:13,280
Never that's a really fun like when I was younger

3260
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:19,680
And now they want to be treated

3261
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:21,472
Like humans

3262
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:26,848
Unfuk in believable

3263
02:43:27,872 --> 02:43:31,200
That clip was called even understanding of the game

3264
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:32,224
Unpause

3265
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:33,760
Unbelievable

3266
02:43:36,064 --> 02:43:38,112
I don't know if it's called

3267
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:43,232
Evolve understanding of supreme of supporting Muslim Muslim

3268
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:46,816
And this is going to end with what I would call an ice cold take

3269
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:49,120
Take that will not age well

3270
02:43:50,656 --> 02:43:56,800
Cringe they crawled into bed

3271
02:43:57,056 --> 02:43:58,592
With people who hate them

3272
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:10,112
Human recipe for disaster you said I want to be weaker and weaker and weaker

3273
02:44:15,744 --> 02:44:18,304
Good luck with that by

3274
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:30,336
Play I come crawling back on their needs to Trump and they learn to shut up because they don't know what they're talking about

3275
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:32,128
Yeah that's probably have some

3276
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:33,408
I'm shaking

3277
02:44:34,176 --> 02:44:35,712
No this is Gavin

3278
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:39,040
I wish

3279
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:42,880
I wish you went to a place where

3280
02:44:43,136 --> 02:44:43,648
Somebody

3281
02:44:43,904 --> 02:44:48,512
Totally clear welcome I would welcome

3282
02:44:49,024 --> 02:44:50,048
Either Mike cernovich

3283
02:44:50,304 --> 02:44:51,584
Or

3284
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:52,352
Gavin McInnes

3285
02:44:52,608 --> 02:44:53,376
I talked to them

3286
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:54,400
Yeah

3287
02:44:54,656 --> 02:44:59,008
I think I believe I want to believe is

3288
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:00,800
A person who

3289
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:01,568
Who wouldn't

3290
02:45:01,824 --> 02:45:02,848
To violence

3291
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:04,896
But God listening to that makes

3292
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:06,432
Violence

3293
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:09,248
Like I like

3294
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,784
Dixie House

3295
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:13,600
Yeah it's not hard

3296
02:45:13,856 --> 02:45:14,624
Antenna

3297
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:16,928
It makes me aware of my own

3298
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:17,952
Masculinity

3299
02:45:18,464 --> 02:45:20,000
Where my first response to that

3300
02:45:20,256 --> 02:45:20,768
Is

3301
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:21,536
Violence needs

3302
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:26,400
Has to do with the fact that I was raised where if you

3303
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:31,264
You got freaking hits

3304
02:45:32,032 --> 02:45:33,568
I mean by that

3305
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:38,944
So it is

3306
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:40,224
It is something bad

3307
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:41,504
Just buy

3308
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:43,040
Just like my

3309
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:43,808
My

3310
02:45:44,064 --> 02:45:44,576
Response

3311
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:46,880
Is part of the culture that

3312
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:49,440
That's really what it is

3313
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:50,976
But they're the

3314
02:45:51,232 --> 02:45:54,048
The unexamined version of

3315
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:58,912
End up hitting him first

3316
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:05,567
You still wouldn't hit him

3317
02:46:05,823 --> 02:46:06,847
I think I think

3318
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:08,383
There could be a conversation

3319
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:09,663
It would devolve into yellow

3320
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:10,431
Undoubted

3321
02:46:10,687 --> 02:46:12,991
Play with me

3322
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:15,039
But

3323
02:46:15,807 --> 02:46:16,831
If that's the difference

3324
02:46:17,087 --> 02:46:18,111
Between like

3325
02:46:18,623 --> 02:46:20,415
Really understanding

3326
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:22,207
These negative impulses

3327
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:23,999
Saying oh no

3328
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:26,559
What makes me great

3329
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:28,607
That's what makes me me

3330
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:29,887
That's my masculine

3331
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:32,703
I just don't know

3332
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:36,799
I listen to this and I worry that my reaction

3333
02:46:37,567 --> 02:46:38,335
Exactly what

3334
02:46:40,383 --> 02:46:41,151
It's exactly what

3335
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:42,431
Perpetuate this

3336
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:43,199
Behavior that

3337
02:46:43,967 --> 02:46:47,039
That I'm doing all of this s*** like we're also laughing at them

3338
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:51,903
This

3339
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:54,207
Central idea of

3340
02:46:55,743 --> 02:46:58,047
I am not part of the school

3341
02:46:58,303 --> 02:47:01,375
Well that's that's really what

3342
02:47:01,631 --> 02:47:03,935
Whenever I

3343
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:05,983
Whenever I hear their rhetoric

3344
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:08,543
And I think that the way to respond to it

3345
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:09,567
Is with what

3346
02:47:09,823 --> 02:47:10,335
It is

3347
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:14,431
Whenever you have thoughts like that

3348
02:47:14,687 --> 02:47:15,711
Just take a second

3349
02:47:17,503 --> 02:47:18,271
If you started group

3350
02:47:18,527 --> 02:47:19,295
Call The Proud boys

3351
02:47:19,807 --> 02:47:25,951
Good point I just be like okay that takes the piss out of him a little bit

3352
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:33,631
How parents would be you no like I tell you stories about the monster under your bed it's like will actually you know he

3353
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:35,935
Yeah he's he's afraid of

3354
02:47:36,703 --> 02:47:42,335
Or whatever going to like you're absolutely right thing out of him

3355
02:47:42,591 --> 02:47:43,615
You started a

3356
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:44,895
Well what

3357
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:47,967
What defeated the KKK in the 50s really

3358
02:47:48,223 --> 02:47:50,015
Was the Superman radio show

3359
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:51,807
Because

3360
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:53,087
One of the writers

3361
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:54,367
For the Superman radio show

3362
02:47:55,391 --> 02:47:56,159
I infiltrated

3363
02:47:56,415 --> 02:47:59,231
Did the Ku Klux Klan and that was

3364
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:00,255
Enemy for a long

3365
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:04,095
And what they did was because he infiltrated the

3366
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:06,399
He could use their dumb

3367
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:08,447
Oh this guy's the Grand Dragon

3368
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:10,239
Until what

3369
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:12,031
His people didn't join the Ku Klux

3370
02:48:13,311 --> 02:48:15,103
Because it was so silly

3371
02:48:15,615 --> 02:48:16,895
Yeah

3372
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:17,663
Super

3373
02:48:18,431 --> 02:48:19,199
How would you

3374
02:48:19,455 --> 02:48:22,015
Why would you join the club Hillary

3375
02:48:22,271 --> 02:48:22,783
Call the guy

3376
02:48:23,039 --> 02:48:23,551
Group with the

3377
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:26,623
Grand Dragon in the end

3378
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:27,391
When Superman

3379
02:48:28,415 --> 02:48:33,791
So we have a couple more clips

3380
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:36,095
If noted satirist

3381
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:43,519
Doesn't this next clip

3382
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:44,799
Virtue moir clips

3383
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:46,335
The next cliff

3384
02:48:46,591 --> 02:48:47,615
I don't know what

3385
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:48,383
Is about

3386
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:49,663
I've completely lost

3387
02:48:49,919 --> 02:48:53,759
I titled it incredibly poorly

3388
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:55,039
It just says

3389
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:58,367
Definitely not stupid

3390
02:48:58,623 --> 02:48:59,391
I think

3391
02:48:59,647 --> 02:49:02,207
I level I think so

3392
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:09,887
We don't have Title 9 crap reinitas legislation that supports their mythical view of America and they just throw

3393
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:13,215
They just learned to shut their mouths when they get back into

3394
02:49:13,471 --> 02:49:16,031
Art music and fashion the other things are good at

3395
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,527
Is coming

3396
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:33,183
That doesn't cut into British soccer into football

3397
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:38,047
You know it when you go problem

3398
02:49:38,303 --> 02:49:44,447
They started head-butting very long and

3399
02:49:47,775 --> 02:49:48,799
That's definitely not stupid

3400
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:53,151
I would argue that is the antithesis of stupid

3401
02:49:54,175 --> 02:49:55,455
Donuts

3402
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:57,503
I not mine his

3403
02:49:58,015 --> 02:49:58,527
What

3404
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:00,319
Did he say

3405
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:04,159
So you was talking about pennies

3406
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:06,975
These beta cup losers

3407
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:09,023
I don't understand

3408
02:50:12,607 --> 02:50:18,751
No you keep you keep thinking that losers who are trying to get

3409
02:50:19,007 --> 02:50:25,151
Leave it for the men. Go back to our

3410
02:50:25,407 --> 02:50:26,943
Back to Arts home decorating

3411
02:50:27,199 --> 02:50:32,575
That's clearly homophobic and Alex Jones correctly

3412
02:50:32,831 --> 02:50:35,135
It's actually straight white men who are

3413
02:50:35,903 --> 02:50:40,511
Preston those fields

3414
02:50:43,327 --> 02:50:43,839
Gavin

3415
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:44,863
Mechanics make

3416
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:46,143
These stupid analogy

3417
02:50:47,679 --> 02:50:48,959
10 year old girls

3418
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:51,519
Going to a soccer hooligan match and trying to

3419
02:50:51,775 --> 02:50:52,287
Start a fight

3420
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:54,847
British accent

3421
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:55,615
Allama.

3422
02:51:01,503 --> 02:51:04,831
You know pricing football that's that's actually the most offense

3423
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:05,599
The part of that clip

3424
02:51:06,111 --> 02:51:07,647
That was a very offensive British act

3425
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:08,415
Not for me

3426
02:51:10,207 --> 02:51:15,583
So I mean okay so if you track what his analogy was it was that liberals

3427
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:16,351
What

3428
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:20,703
Liberals in the political sphere and in this

3429
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:21,983
Protest

3430
02:51:22,751 --> 02:51:25,311
Year-old girls as opposed

3431
02:51:25,567 --> 02:51:28,127
To the soccer hooligan that are the proud boys

3432
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:33,503
Okay okay so his point was that liberals were punching outside of their there

3433
02:51:33,759 --> 02:51:39,391
Wake lazareno they punch like we've talked about that earlier

3434
02:51:39,647 --> 02:51:41,183
So yeah that's basically what he saying

3435
02:51:41,695 --> 02:51:46,815
Endogenic kicked out of them and then eventually go back to home decor

3436
02:51:47,327 --> 02:51:47,839
And all of the

3437
02:51:48,095 --> 02:51:48,863
Eclipse that was Hertz

3438
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:51,167
Eventually boiled down

3439
02:51:52,191 --> 02:51:52,959
Liberals

3440
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:54,239
Cape

3441
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:55,519
Fight

3442
02:51:56,799 --> 02:51:58,591
Yes and they mean that

3443
02:52:00,895 --> 02:52:03,711
Yeah they don't ever mean that in a like

3444
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:06,271
Even when Alex junco even when Alex

3445
02:52:06,527 --> 02:52:07,295
Just trying to say that

3446
02:52:07,551 --> 02:52:09,599
Metaphorically hit women

3447
02:52:10,111 --> 02:52:14,207
Ivorian was talking about how they considered a conspiracy theorist cuz they don't

3448
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:15,487
Engaging is ideas

3449
02:52:15,743 --> 02:52:17,023
Rattles off numbers

3450
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:18,559
Correct

3451
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:20,863
State record is coming back

3452
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:23,167
Back to we need to be able to

3453
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:24,447
Punch

3454
02:52:27,263 --> 02:52:30,335
Last week was that I'm coming to the conclusion

3455
02:52:31,103 --> 02:52:33,663
That Alex Jones thinks fact-checking is censorship

3456
02:52:33,919 --> 02:52:36,223
Yeah it is this

3457
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:38,527
That might makes right

3458
02:52:38,783 --> 02:52:41,087
And if you are saying that he's wrong

3459
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:42,111
And you have

3460
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:43,903
Evidence to prove that you're bullying

3461
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:50,559
He beat the s*** out of them

3462
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:51,583
Answer that

3463
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:53,375
Kind of is all that

3464
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:54,655
If that bullies a dog

3465
02:52:54,911 --> 02:52:55,423
Oh man

3466
02:52:55,679 --> 02:52:56,447
Beginning

3467
02:52:56,703 --> 02:52:57,215
Pulled

3468
02:52:57,471 --> 02:52:58,239
You will go fuc

3469
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:02,079
Yes absolutely it is it is

3470
02:53:02,847 --> 02:53:05,663
It's insane cuz it is that two sides of the mouth

3471
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:09,247
My ideas

3472
02:53:09,503 --> 02:53:11,295
On the other side they come to beat the s*** out of

3473
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:13,599
That's not an idea

3474
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:18,463
Over the course of this episode good bit of stuff that

3475
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:23,839
But I'm not doctor takes out contacts

3476
02:53:24,351 --> 02:53:25,631
Hour hour-and-a-half

3477
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:27,935
Interview of all

3478
02:53:28,191 --> 02:53:30,239
You don't need to go into the repetitive stuff

3479
02:53:30,495 --> 02:53:34,335
We don't need to talk about Syria more than we need to write

3480
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:40,991
Flying out of someone's mouth

3481
02:53:41,759 --> 02:53:43,039
We have facts we leave

3482
02:53:43,551 --> 02:53:46,111
Made arguments that completely deflate those Arkham

3483
02:53:46,623 --> 02:53:48,927
We've used even the things that they cite

3484
02:53:49,183 --> 02:53:50,207
Yeah

3485
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:54,303
Now if you want to say is that like

3486
02:53:54,815 --> 02:53:55,327
Do

3487
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:09,151
And I think about that

3488
02:54:09,407 --> 02:54:09,919
The Fight Club

3489
02:54:10,943 --> 02:54:11,711
The Chuck Palahniuk

3490
02:54:12,991 --> 02:54:13,503
Rule number one

3491
02:54:16,575 --> 02:54:17,087
It is

3492
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:17,855
It is very much

3493
02:54:18,623 --> 02:54:19,135
Fantasy

3494
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:21,951
To the point where I

3495
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:22,975
Genuinely

3496
02:54:27,071 --> 02:54:30,911
Really haven't engaged with the text

3497
02:54:31,423 --> 02:54:33,727
Because even I read the book and

3498
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:35,263
Like

3499
02:54:35,775 --> 02:54:39,615
There's a lot of like masculinity masturbation

3500
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:45,503
But I think one of the bigger theme

3501
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:46,271
Well that's what I do

3502
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:49,343
I think one of the bigger themes is the disintegration of the

3503
02:54:49,599 --> 02:54:51,391
The self and becoming whole again

3504
02:54:51,647 --> 02:54:54,463
Yeah you know there is a part of it that is

3505
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:57,023
That Tyler Durden personality was it

3506
02:54:57,279 --> 02:55:01,119
Negative manifestation of the the narrator's cell

3507
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:03,679
It's your your basic

3508
02:55:04,191 --> 02:55:04,959
I like Wall Street

3509
02:55:06,495 --> 02:55:07,519
Was supposed to

3510
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:09,311
Was supposed to

3511
02:55:09,567 --> 02:55:11,103
Take down that idea

3512
02:55:16,223 --> 02:55:18,271
What are the same thing with Wolf of Wall Street

3513
02:55:18,527 --> 02:55:23,135
For the way that you look at

3514
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:23,903
When is that

3515
02:55:26,975 --> 02:55:27,487
Is the hero

3516
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,767
When in reality

3517
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:29,535
He's the eve

3518
02:55:29,791 --> 02:55:30,303
He's being

3519
02:55:31,071 --> 02:55:33,887
Awesome Parody is not understood by

3520
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:35,679
Which is why

3521
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:37,727
I believe

3522
02:55:37,983 --> 02:55:38,495
Set the Irish

3523
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:41,567
The truth is that

3524
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:45,407
That part

3525
02:55:47,455 --> 02:55:48,223
Sing an outlandish

3526
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:51,039
Proposal

3527
02:55:54,623 --> 02:55:55,391
Get some things up

3528
02:55:55,903 --> 02:55:58,719
And this is an argument that actually factually I can't

3529
02:55:59,999 --> 02:56:00,511
Super Disick

3530
02:56:00,767 --> 02:56:01,535
Agree with but I ain't guy

3531
02:56:05,887 --> 02:56:12,031
Down

3532
02:56:13,567 --> 02:56:16,383
So that's the one thing we can't really like

3533
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:17,407
I can't get that

3534
02:56:17,663 --> 02:56:19,967
I can't really argue with that with research

3535
02:56:20,223 --> 02:56:21,247
I can vary

3536
02:56:24,575 --> 02:56:25,599
Well I mean

3537
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:29,695
It's hard to deny that

3538
02:56:29,951 --> 02:56:36,095
The patriarchies back in style at least know if it isn't he was very popular this

3539
02:56:36,351 --> 02:56:37,119
Nebulous concept

3540
02:56:37,375 --> 02:56:40,191
I think that you could a lot of people could probably

3541
02:56:40,447 --> 02:56:41,983
You don't poke some holes in it

3542
02:56:42,239 --> 02:56:45,567
What have you and then the end show the patriarchy is a negative

3543
02:56:46,335 --> 02:56:47,359
But I understand it

3544
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:50,943
Most people who support

3545
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:52,735
The patriarchy coming back

3546
02:56:52,991 --> 02:56:54,527
What are motivated by is

3547
02:56:54,783 --> 02:56:55,551
The fear of women being

3548
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:58,879
They don't think that women are capable of being in charge

3549
02:56:59,135 --> 02:57:00,671
They're scared of women being

3550
02:57:00,927 --> 02:57:01,695
Equivalent to them

3551
02:57:02,207 --> 02:57:06,047
Threatened by the idea of listening to women when they tell them to do things

3552
02:57:06,303 --> 02:57:09,887
Agreed and I think that is one of the other definitions of

3553
02:57:10,143 --> 02:57:10,655
Cowardice

3554
02:57:10,911 --> 02:57:11,423
I think it's

3555
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:12,447
Not manly

3556
02:57:12,703 --> 02:57:13,983
I think it's not adult

3557
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:17,823
And if you really are super into the patriarchy

3558
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:19,615
I really don't understand

3559
02:57:19,871 --> 02:57:21,919
What argument you could possibly have

3560
02:57:22,175 --> 02:57:23,199
Yeah well I mean

3561
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:27,551
Study this is the thing that I forgot

3562
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:33,439
Just this is Burns

3563
02:57:36,255 --> 02:57:36,767
The pastor

3564
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:39,583
During the wedding ceremony

3565
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:41,887
1st Timothy 2:11 which

3566
02:57:42,399 --> 02:57:43,935
Isleta woman learn it all submissive

3567
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:46,751
I permit no woman to have authority over

3568
02:57:47,007 --> 02:57:47,775
Man because Adam

3569
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:50,079
That's not a great wedding

3570
02:57:50,335 --> 02:57:51,871
It was in the wedding

3571
02:57:53,151 --> 02:57:53,663
Yeah that's

3572
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:59,039
What you if that's what you really believe

3573
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:01,855
No reason other than

3574
02:58:02,111 --> 02:58:03,391
God picture

3575
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:04,671
Yeah

3576
02:58:05,695 --> 02:58:08,511
You should net women should never be allowed to do

3577
02:58:09,023 --> 02:58:11,839
Unbelievable

3578
02:58:12,351 --> 02:58:13,119
Physical

3579
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:16,447
Looks like you were talking about like

3580
02:58:16,703 --> 02:58:19,519
Sports being prevalent because forces existed longer

3581
02:58:19,775 --> 02:58:21,567
It's the same kind of thing is just

3582
02:58:21,823 --> 02:58:23,359
Back when we were caveman

3583
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:26,175
Era of our evolution

3584
02:58:26,431 --> 02:58:26,943
Men

3585
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:30,015
Physically dominated women Ergo we had to

3586
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:30,783
Control

3587
02:58:31,039 --> 02:58:31,551
In most

3588
02:58:31,807 --> 02:58:32,831
Primitive civilization

3589
02:58:33,343 --> 02:58:36,159
They're a bunch of them that had matrilineal civilizations

3590
02:58:36,671 --> 02:58:37,951
Mother ones were weirder and heading

3591
02:58:38,207 --> 02:58:39,231
Like a bunk killer based

3592
02:58:39,487 --> 02:58:40,255
Civilization

3593
02:58:40,511 --> 02:58:41,279
What kind of swinging

3594
02:58:41,791 --> 02:58:44,607
You know there are a bunch of them they were a lot happier

3595
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:51,007
Yeah

3596
02:58:52,543 --> 02:58:54,591
Studies have already shown that male-dominated

3597
02:58:54,847 --> 02:58:55,359
Society

3598
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:56,383
Fragile

3599
02:58:58,687 --> 02:59:04,063
Even if they're still sort of male-dominated male-dominated

3600
02:59:04,319 --> 02:59:05,343
Secondary degrees

3601
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:09,183
Civilizations where communities race

3602
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:12,511
Your uncle would raise you and you sort of

3603
02:59:12,767 --> 02:59:14,047
Not really trade kids

3604
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:17,119
But there would be a communal understanding of like

3605
02:59:17,375 --> 02:59:19,167
Your parents don't own you

3606
02:59:20,191 --> 02:59:24,799
Where is matrilineal is the mother is the head of the community patrilineal is the

3607
02:59:25,055 --> 02:59:25,567
The father

3608
02:59:25,823 --> 02:59:28,383
But unfortunately as our civilization

3609
02:59:28,639 --> 02:59:29,151
Grown

3610
02:59:30,431 --> 02:59:32,735
As men are the mighty ones

3611
02:59:32,991 --> 02:59:35,295
Physically and the ones were full of testosterone

3612
02:59:36,831 --> 02:59:41,183
Restaurant with each other the patrilineal society

3613
02:59:41,439 --> 02:59:42,463
And the ones that have

3614
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:44,511
Exhausted

3615
02:59:44,767 --> 02:59:45,535
And destroyed

3616
02:59:45,791 --> 02:59:46,559
A lot of the other one

3617
02:59:47,327 --> 02:59:51,679
So we end up with all of our civilizations basically that exist nowadays are the

3618
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:53,215
The Manor in charge

3619
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:59,359
Does the ones that have their roots in the caveman days when men were physically able to.

3620
02:59:59,615 --> 03:00:03,199
The civilizations that are the best at destroying other civilization

3621
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:04,991
134

3622
03:00:05,503 --> 03:00:07,295
Exactly where in the long game of Risk

3623
03:00:07,551 --> 03:00:08,319
Can we just have reached

3624
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:11,135
Yeah get close

3625
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:12,159
Year 2

3626
03:00:12,927 --> 03:00:18,303
You know what I've played a lot of Risk game that seemed like they were about to end

3627
03:00:20,095 --> 03:00:25,215
They were there for another seven hours

3628
03:00:26,239 --> 03:00:31,103
North Korea is going to roll Shady

3629
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:34,431
God dammit Kim Jong-un

3630
03:00:34,687 --> 03:00:38,271
Kim Jong-il still has Oceania

3631
03:00:39,551 --> 03:00:41,087
Why does it always win goes to the

3632
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:44,159
I know but you know what I'm saying like

3633
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:47,231
That that's why

3634
03:00:47,487 --> 03:00:48,767
These male ideas exist

3635
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:49,535
It's not because

3636
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:51,327
Dick it's because of just

3637
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:55,167
The problem

3638
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:57,727
We know what the real solution

3639
03:00:59,263 --> 03:01:00,287
Which is all men need

3640
03:01:00,799 --> 03:01:01,311
Immediately

3641
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:03,103
Different solution

3642
03:01:03,359 --> 03:01:03,871
What's your

3643
03:01:04,383 --> 03:01:06,175
I want to shave Gavin McGinnis

3644
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:06,943
Does beard and make

3645
03:01:08,735 --> 03:01:09,247
That

3646
03:01:12,831 --> 03:01:13,855
I totally support you

3647
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:16,671
But I was like

3648
03:01:16,927 --> 03:01:18,207
But I was like 22

3649
03:01:18,719 --> 03:01:20,255
We do not Advocate violence

3650
03:01:20,511 --> 03:01:21,535
We do however

3651
03:01:22,047 --> 03:01:24,607
Advocate shaving

3652
03:01:25,375 --> 03:01:26,143
Feeding it to him

3653
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:28,959
Do you want to go with slowly or like big clumps

3654
03:01:29,215 --> 03:01:29,727
I don't care

3655
03:01:29,983 --> 03:01:33,823
When I was like that whatever 22-23 my brother sent me a news article

3656
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:36,127
Was this guy

3657
03:01:36,383 --> 03:01:37,151
Who had been

3658
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:37,919
Screwed over in

3659
03:01:38,175 --> 03:01:38,687
Anicow deal

3660
03:01:38,943 --> 03:01:41,759
You told about him over

3661
03:01:42,015 --> 03:01:48,159
Held him down

3662
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:53,023
Set then I thought that was like one of the most degrading things possible

3663
03:01:54,559 --> 03:01:56,607
While not necessarily being applied equally

3664
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:57,631
It sometimes

3665
03:01:57,887 --> 03:01:58,399
The best

3666
03:01:58,911 --> 03:02:03,007
Yeah so we're going to get out of here

3667
03:02:03,263 --> 03:02:04,799
Because this has been so

3668
03:02:05,055 --> 03:02:05,823
Toxic

3669
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:08,383
I want to take

3670
03:02:08,639 --> 03:02:11,199
Trip back to the clip we played on the last episode

3671
03:02:11,455 --> 03:02:12,735
Is a gentle reminder

3672
03:02:12,991 --> 03:02:13,503
I hear you

3673
03:02:14,015 --> 03:02:15,295
Plants beautiful I love it

3674
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:16,831
Just like I love my

3675
03:02:17,855 --> 03:02:19,391
Mommy when I was six years old

3676
03:02:20,927 --> 03:02:22,975
About 6 results you kick me off for lap

3677
03:02:25,791 --> 03:02:28,095
You don't get any more love.

3678
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:33,983
That's what come down soon

3679
03:02:34,495 --> 03:02:37,567
And that's the man who is put on the show that we have just listened

3680
03:02:37,823 --> 03:02:40,127
Come to Alex

3681
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:43,711
I would you just did

3682
03:02:43,967 --> 03:02:44,479
You just

3683
03:02:44,735 --> 03:02:45,247
Dropped

3684
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:46,015
A hammer

3685
03:02:47,295 --> 03:02:50,623
That's the only way to describe that all of this

3686
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:54,719
But yeah relates to this this is why Alex is totally fine

3687
03:02:54,975 --> 03:02:57,279
Having people like Gavin McGinnis on his show

3688
03:02:57,535 --> 03:03:00,095
Now we've had 24 hours a day

3689
03:03:00,351 --> 03:03:03,167
Doing it for 20 years and got drunk on Arrow

3690
03:03:03,423 --> 03:03:09,567
I imagine he might say something like a crazy week

3691
03:03:10,847 --> 03:03:12,639
Been pretty outside of our scope

3692
03:03:12,895 --> 03:03:16,479
In terms like he wasn't nearly as bad as those two

3693
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:18,527
This is all about

3694
03:03:18,783 --> 03:03:20,831
This is what it's all about. You're mad at women

3695
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:25,183
Congratulations

3696
03:03:26,207 --> 03:03:27,999
Now it's right

3697
03:03:28,767 --> 03:03:31,839
Tragic f****** tragedy of a human being

3698
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:36,191
People who otherwise probably wouldn't

3699
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:36,959
Like

3700
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:44,895
Because eggs

3701
03:03:45,407 --> 03:03:45,919
And

3702
03:03:46,175 --> 03:03:47,199
Godzilla

3703
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:49,247

3711
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:21,759
We talked about

3712
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:29,183
What did you notice

3713
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:30,463
I noticed

3714
03:04:31,231 --> 03:04:32,255
Double policy wonk

3715
03:04:32,767 --> 03:04:34,815
Holding

3716
03:04:36,863 --> 03:04:40,447
