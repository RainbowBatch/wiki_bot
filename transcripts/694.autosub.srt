1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge fight

4
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
Alex Jones

5
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
I guess it's the same things out.

6
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
What is Chicago

7
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
Summer days

8
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,184
I'm going to take 100Â° something

9
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
It's a mess man we don't have Cooks right on the ground

10
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Had we all had

11
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
That heat wave

12
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
Last week it was

13
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Yep just

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,616
Complete disaster

15
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
One day like Sweater Weather

16
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
X100

17
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,320
This is a mess reminds me of how it wasn't like in my youth

18
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,928
You know before whenever everybody was like global warming there still winter

19
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
There was always a bit of seasonal variability

20
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
But it does definitely feel different

21
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
Normally anecdotal like oh you know the past it's not like the way it used to be this really does know there's

22
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
I thought I need to go pick up a

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
Prescription and I am intentionally waiting till after we work order

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,000
As if the sun will be down by then

25
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,864
Exactly at 9 p.m. or something but

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
Yeah I'm still trying to bank on that

27
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Fingers crossed

28
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
I wish you the best

29
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,568
I'm not sure if my bright spot is but I guess it's

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
For whatever

31
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,712
What is similarly low stakes

32
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064
I told you know my partner made to the end of the school year

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
This was the first real day

34
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
That she did not have an alarm clock on

35
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
No I wake up at 6:30 I cannot go back to

36
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
To sleep sure

37
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
So

38
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
This

39
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Morning

40
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
I slept in until 8:45

41
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,776
Greatest day of my greatest day of my life on Earth

42
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
Crazy late I don't know if I've seen that side of 9

43
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
In a while

44
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
I've been off at 8:40

45
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
Congratulations hope you enjoy whatever. Of time.

46
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Somebody else's maybe not been waking up early all right Alex Jones

47
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
What is a happened

48
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
Yeah we expected him to be back on Sunday but he's been

49
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
Still gone

50
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Say he was going to be back

51
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
We're recording this on Tuesday have been back today I'm not entirely sure

52
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
I was gone Sunday gone Monday

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,976
Angel talk a little bit about that and some other stuff

54
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
But I really do I really hope he flag

55
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
Is Hangover missed a flight

56
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,639

Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

60
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983

61
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,055
An apology and a happy birthday

62
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
Do Ethan from Mimi your future wife

63
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
Supposed to be

64
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,831
I don't know sorry

65
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
I'm a policy wonk

66
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,535
Rodger Stones bikini wax

67
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:28,191
Thank you very much. I said that no message did include an apology that I had to say it so

68
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Let It Go

69
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
Next Nicholas are one of the top box

70
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,663
Engineers in the country and erstwhile tequila sunset

71
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
Text confusing as it is almost pleasing

72
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
Baba Yaga the only friend Alex deserves

73
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,351
Thank you so much

74
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
I have

75
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Risen above

76
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Miami

77
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
A little breaking for me

78
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
And then we're going

79
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
To come back

80
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
And I'm going to start the show over

81
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
F*** you

82
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

83
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
F*** you and your new world order

84
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
And f*** the horse you rode in on

85
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
All your s***

86
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Maybe later on West Broad

87
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

88
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

89
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
And you never see me again

90
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
That's really what I want to do

91
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
I never want to come back here again

92
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
I apologize to

93
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Yesterday that I

94
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

95
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
I'll be better tomorrow

96
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
We'll never know if he's better today cuz he's walking nowhere to be found a boy he's in the Wind

97
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
Man if he fled that be great I doubt it

98
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Ohio

99
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,727
We have a couple of Clips here from Monday's show is hosting

100
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
The fact that Alex is not there

101
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,127
And so here is the beginning of

102
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
A little bit of a breakdown discussion of

103
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,271
Where the f*** is Island

104
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
And you're wondering where is Alex Towing

105
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
You told me Alex would be back

106
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Well yes

107
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
The plan was for Alex to be back

108
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,791
Problem is we're living in Biden's America

109
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
What

110
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
Collapsing civilization

111
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
That were in right now and so part of the

112
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Symptom

113
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Collapsing Society

114
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
Are collapsing civilization is

115
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
Flight cancellations and what is being now called

116
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Travel Army

117
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
Getting a man travel Armageddon price

118
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
Canceled flights in Alex's apparently this is a reason that he's not into

119
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
I think you probably just partied a little too hard

120
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
By the way by the Russian regime

121
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Do you need exact same hiding place that Saddam was not the real ground

122
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
I think I think he probably just got drunk and missed a flight

123
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
Conspiracy though according to Allen

124
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,023
I like how we can somehow condescending towards us like we're stupid for thinking

125
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,887
How dare we think that he should be back this America

126
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
Well

127
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Cancellations are ahead

128
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
Sure it's a chore

129
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Alex is f******

130
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
So rich so goddamn by your own f****** play this is a

131
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,207
The level of irresponsibility that is shocking to come from a celebrity and media personality

132
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
And why is Owen delivering this instead of the phone

133
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
You drunk cuz he missed his flight and decided

134
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
F*** it or if he's in Belarus no Wi-Fi

135
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
A little bit more

136
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
So I'm not trying to

137
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,711
Talked at length about why Alex isn't in that's why he's not in

138
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
The real story here is that

139
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
It's just yet another example

140
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,903
Oh how everything is collapsing now

141
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,999
In just a year-and-a-half of democrat control and the Biden wife

142
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Everything

143
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Collapsing

144
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Including

145
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
The ability to fly

146
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Stress-free

147
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
And easily get from one airport to the other

148
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
This is fun for Owen and all but like I don't understand exactly how we're going to make this Biden's fault

149
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Cancelled because of weather

150
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,855
Cheyenne like

151
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
I guess that's

152
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
Possible no that's

153
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
We're at the level of like

154
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,095
Oh that's Zeus for you you know I got struck by lightning what you going to do that Zeus

155
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,495
Do you know like you're just you're just saying a name to give cause to your troubles

156
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
Insulate heightened levels of cancellation

157
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
It was just a

158
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
It was being experienced in the United States

159
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Across-the-board

160
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
In the world's right still running rampant through everything

161
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Transmission is f******

162
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Up

163
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
You know

164
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,743
And flight load is is up

165
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,839
And there were multiple holiday consideration right

166
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,959
Yo it's just it's not the only thing I can really think that could really like

167
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Stick to hear is

168
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:56,895
X putting out bad vibes that makes sense I would accept that

169
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,759
That almost undercut your own argument when you say within a year-and-a-half of Biden

170
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Is it

171
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
It's like

172
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:08,927
Fine is not done shittin a year-and-a-half so if you're complaining about now because of

173
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
Maybe it's cuz of the

174
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Recent past

175
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,607
No no Biden's destroyed the airline industry

176
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
. it's kind of amazing

177
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,775
And a lot of money in the military

178
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,383
I know where he is doing

179
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,479
So I'm doing today we're going to be talking about August 5th 2000

180
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,807
Three on the past but I have to be honest

181
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
Yeah it's not a very interesting episode

182
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
There is not a ton

183
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
That goes on

184
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
So thankfully

185
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Something came to my attention

186
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
Okay I would like to give a hat tip to my friend Ali

187
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655

00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
It is uncovered

192
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
From the internet

193
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551

194
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879

Or maybe I don't know maybe wasn't even paid for this who f****** nose haha

196
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
But Alex Jones

197
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Did

198
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
A public service announcement out of here

199
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Teenager

Any credit

203
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Gina Was Naive about the

204
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Responsibility

205
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Personal finance

206
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Nothing can

207
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Show me more important

208
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359

Work

212
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Teenagers aren't

213
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Notorious

214
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Forgiving into their desire

215
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Without thinking ahead to the concert

216
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Before they know it

217
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Teenagers

218
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
In over their heads

219
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
No more money

220
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
The lake and pay

221
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023

Or outside credit

224
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Counseling agent

225

For help

226
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
But that does

227
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Doesn't have to have

228
00:12:55,423 --> 00:13:01,567
School responsibility and credit card management for teens

229
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
I don't know

230
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
I don't know what

231
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Could bring me more just like simple pleasure

232
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
So stupid

233
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
Free Infowars Alex had already had like a public access

234
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
I think you found it in for

235
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
So this is this is before that but like

236
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,679
Obviously a weirdo

237
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
But yeah this is I was a PSA

238
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Those made by company called Lucerne media and they shot it at the CBS

239
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
Studio in Austin and Alex is the host

240
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
For whatever reason real there's weird

241
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,111
Painfully done Recreations of like

242
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
A-Team

243
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,999
Who got a credit card and went to the mall and talk like a kid could get everything and

244
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
You know it's just a fact fired alright alright this is a bit like finding out that girdles did a PSA for Nottely

245
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
Leaving your pets in the class you know like wait what

246
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
Suit

247
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,783
Super ripped Alex Jones. He's not all that ripped in my face

248
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
Okay but driving the middle stage bodybuilder and sick next weirdo

249
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,535
Keys and he's standing in front of

250
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,143
Would be a green screen but with like a bunch of bills and credit check

251
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,543
Post a link to the video of it cuz it only has about 300

252
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
Earthquake

253
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,527
Is at the end of the video

254
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
There's a list

255
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Of

256
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
The other videos in this series

257
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
At what time is called herpes it with you for life

258
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Spektru

259
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,375
Smoking and all the biggest issues

260
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,959
It's an open question whether or not Alex hosted all of them

261
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,287
And I think that there's a good chance that he did ohmygod

262
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Now

263
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
I was able to find

264
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
The smoking one

265
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
Haha at a library

266
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,319
In Danvers Massachusetts

267
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
Start a VHS tape

268
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,935
We've got to the show Sarah Shahi

269
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:42,335
There's a friend who is doing VHS to DVD conversion is that right are they in Danvers Massachusetts

270
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,895
You could call somebody and have them mail it to you

271
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Maybe but I don't know if his library in Danvers is going to just be us

272
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Card for that Library

273
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Danvers Massachusetts

274
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Haha

275
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
We'll find a way

276
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,607
Maybe we have some enterprising listeners in Danvers Massachusetts

277
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:10,751
I believe there's another copy of it in Idaho at a library of America

278
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,639
I want to find all of these and see if Alex has the impact

279
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
We host of all of them because

280
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
It would be truly bizarre

281
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
To to see him talking about the dangers of smoking and herpes

282
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,999
The problem is if you get all of them together in one place then the dragon will emerge annually

283
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
Granted a wish

284
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,423
Write my wish will already have been granted

285
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
You and the dragon just a Thursday

286
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,591
Stare at each other for the rest of time fine with that.

287
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
The upside of this is it's pretty hilarious

288
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
This exists

289
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Inside of it is

290
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
Alex is pretty boring

291
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
As a PS a pitchman

292
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
The Lola

293
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Then increase the

294
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Poppy later on

295
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
This is

296
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Legal notice

297
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607

Dollar

Another

304
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
To make a zoo day

305
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
The holiday

306
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
When do male

307
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
These are the kind

308
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Add up

309
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
$10 piece

310
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Cost

311
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Hundred dollars

312
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
In the long run

313
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,583
Pretty boring easy easy with dollars

314
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
Tell you grants from the government man

315
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Is it

316
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,543
What was Vince I think is really interesting about this is that like

317
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
He's not yelling about fiat currency

318
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:57,759
I'm talking about the Federal Reserve about financial issues literacy 14th

319
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
Needs to know more

320
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
About big fat I'm going to be honest I had several overdraft fees when I was 19 years old and

321
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,887
I could have been served by this BS a educational program it should have made its way

322
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
Problem was I didn't see Alex Jones at the right time in my life that's what's gone

323
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
When he was giving helpful messages

324
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
But read your pill

325
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
Nomads

326
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
Imagine a world where this show at you were like

327
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,903
And I know everything about Alex Jones that I'm like the only thing I know about Alex Jones

328
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Is how not to get overdraft fees hot ttr90 but Alex Jones if you saved me $70

329
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
When I was a team

330
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Okay alright

331
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:53,055
I just think that it would really funny if they gave him a little more creative control able to be like

332
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
Read the Bell jar that you know you pay your bill on time and also three Senators Federal Reserve

333
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
My friend Ron Hall about

334
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Iamgold

335
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:09,695
I don't know I think that would be a bore fun way for him to go is to turn his full conspiracy powers on just

336
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
Overdraft fees and be like

337
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,375
Method Man let's get into the weeds all right there's no reason that they should be able to charge you overdraft fee

338
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,007
They're creating this feed order to make more profits for them and if you know anything about the Bible you'll know that Jesus

339
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Said that you sorry is wrong I think if I remember correctly that the big issue that Al Franken champy

340
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
And in that book why not me

341
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Has fake run for president a president one of his big issues was ATM fees

342
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,415
Honestly getting rid of ATM fee

343
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,767
Bino maybe there's something to that

344
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
The grief

345
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
Warning

346
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
In this TSA and I think that

347
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,983
They speak of off weird knowing his career trajectory

348
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
That $10

349
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
Car with a bad check

350
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
End up causing

351
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
$60 arm

352
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Give that check also

353
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Other chick

354
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
One of the most

355
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Important

356
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
In life

357
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Good credit rate

358
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
As the world

359
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
More popular

360
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Computer

361
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
Important

362
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
And what

363
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
We are

364
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
A person

365
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
The first thing

Make the city

369
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
It seems very weird but

370
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:38,015
He's stressing so much like you've got to keep your credit rating good

371
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
The social credit score that he's a little worried about liking

372
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,719
Hey your potential employers are going to check your credit score in order to see if you should be hired

373
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,023
Used to be furious about that

374
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,423
How is it that you can read the John Birch Society and still do a PSA for financial literacy

375
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
I'll tell you how

376
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,263
Because at the end of the day the John Birch Society is more about

377
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
Then it is about anything

378
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
In 1998 Alex was

379
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Desperate

380
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,015
Nordstrom

381
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,087
Psa's for things

382
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Essentially

383
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
Incompatible with his worldview I mean he asked his dad for a radio show that's pretty incompatible with his

384
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
Pull yourself up by your boat show

385
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,656
Ultimate really is

386
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,752
You know this include some advice that he should have taken himself out no

387
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
The primary way to

388
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
To avoid all of the

389
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
The problems we

390
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Don't call Scotia

391
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Spend more money

392
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:47,648
Considering it has a business that 250 billion dollars in the hole

393
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
His own company

394
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Or whatever to spill

395
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,096
Meto ironic a little bit

396
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
I don't fully believe in the simulation because

397
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,984
As if it were real then we would have heard him be like

398
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Listen

399
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
I'm sorry but

400
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:10,944
Columbine really happened and if anybody ever claims that a school shooting is a false flag in the future

401
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
They're really f***

402
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
That would be that would be too on-the-nose be really weird about that

403
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,352
Coincidence goddamnit I get what you're saying it would be

404
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
Evidence of larger powers

405
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,056
So anyway that was just a little bit of a delight to to experience

406
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Had this out a little bit cuz like I said

407
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
August 5th

408
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
2003

409
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Not much

410
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
Not much going on a couple of

411
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
Actually important things

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
To bring up and it's good to have them

413
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:56,512
Kind of in the immediate time after we talked about the last episode cuz they relate a little bit

414
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:02,144
A the first thing in this actually does this links back to his episode from August

415
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
West 4th

416
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Donald

417
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
On

418
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Order in Spanish

419
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
He got the videos

420
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
World Order

421
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Quite a few other

422
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
No offense to Gary Busey but I wouldn't use them as a citation when I was trying to list people who believe the same crazy stuff

423
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Bible Essure

424
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,208
Busey's famous associating him with your ideas kind of makes me trust your ideas even less

425
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,816
It's fun that Alex's thing that the Gibson family knows about the New World Order though

426
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
We talked about hunting Gibson Mel's father on ended

427
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,216
Horrible anti-semitic comments on our last 2003 episode

428
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,520
But this actually deserves a little revisiting

429
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,128
The point that Alex is making is at Hutton Gibson knows about the New World Order

430
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,784
This definitively means that Alex is asserting that he and Hutton Gibson are of the same mind about this globalist

431
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,600
Pharisee and I feel huge f****** problem

432
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,928
In an interview from 2004 on a show called speaker piece

433
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,256
Hutton Gibson did expound on his thoughts about the New World Order

434
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
And here's what he said oh boy

435
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:39,168
Quote the Federal Reserve and those foreign bankers who owner currency in charges for it

436
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:45,568
Before in Bankers who run the international Reserve like the Rothschilds and their allies in this country like the Rockefellers who were

437
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
Jews and others who on the money

438
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:53,504
There's a book out not too long ago listing the big Jewish families in the country which lists the Rockefellers

439
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
Has Jewish and there was no

440
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
Add another point he says quote

441
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
I don't know what the Jews agenda is accepted it's all about

442
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,024
Control there after one world religion and one world government

443
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
Alex is an idiot but he's not this kind of an idiot

444
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,728
He knows with Hutton Gibson think so New World Order is and he's signaling his agreement here

445
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
On the one hand biscuits

446
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,896
Be indicative of Alex's own crypto anti-Semitism but that would be difficult to prove definitively

447
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,248
It's easy to point to a mountain of circumstantial evidence

448
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
Inside his head

449
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
What I think is more important is that you better believe that any anti-semitic or Neo-Nazi leaving listeners and no

450
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Know what Hutton Gibson believe

451
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,864
And hearing Alex Express that they're on the same page it serves as a wink to that Community they well you might say globe

452
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Blessed and pretend he's not a bigot

453
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
He's only doing that because he can't get away with saying what he actually knows

454
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Believe

455
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Alma Guerra cuz they'll get in trouble

456
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,872
And just to clarify you like I hadn't had been self

457
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,712
Publishing a newsletter titled the war is now since 1994

458
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
So a lot of his beliefs

459
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,368
They they were the Private Matter even if it's a lot of it didn't become the subject of mainstream public debate

460
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,672
Until around the time of Passion of the Christ

461
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,256
He was still a figure that was known in those circles right all right

462
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,584
So I find this to be a little f***** up

463
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
It does feel like

464
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Alex has

465
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Like I

466
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Chaotic you know those

467
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
You know those alignment chart see no lawful good local news like

468
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,896
Alex just has all the chaotic alignment locked up he's got like

469
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,224
Mike Busey on hand he's got the Nugent right next to

470
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,552
He's got Charlie Sheen like nothing anything chaotic blank

471
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
Alex has a hole

472
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,672
Call Dre of people to feel back on I'm good

473
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
Kinky fried

474
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
I mean

475
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
Bill Ayers

476
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
Is he chaotic though Weather Underground vertical chaotic chaotic chaotic

477
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
He's very knocked out he's very lawful

478
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
Lawful good

479
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,528
Borderline lawful neutral anything he just showed up one time for a bizarre interview

480
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Christopher Walker

481
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:10,720
Can how about that he showed up there was an accident

482
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Cooking with the Bells

483
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,912
So on our last episode Alex talked a little bit about

484
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,752
This idea that Jay Leno was going to have a makeover by the

485
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,104
The Queer Eye For The Straight Guy

486
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
Yeah

487
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
Touches back on this story but

488
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Wheatley change

489
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
About how

490
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
The story that he was

491
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
Covering yesterday

492
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
On the last episode

493
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
EB with

494
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,944
He messed up but now it's completely

495
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,832
The actual article is about how Queer Eye For The Straight Guy was pulling big ratings and sponsors were paying a lot

496
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
To get product placement on the show

497
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,696
It was also mention the Jay Leno was going to get a makeover from them

498
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,352
Obviously the reasons Jay would want to do this is because he wants to associate himself with something popular and make himself appear to be more

499
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
More with the time

500
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:26,496
Or maybe he has an agent with a connection to the producers of queer right whatever the case

501
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
It's a marketing opportunity for him

502
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,896
Alex didn't understand this story or he willfully misrepresented it on

503
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,480
The last show that he's created a touchdown for the audience

504
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,320
He's writing a completely new story that has no connection to reality at all

505
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
Apparently now

506
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
This article is supposed to be about gay

507
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
Paying for product placement on Jay Leno show

508
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:53,888
I'm not sure what that even means but the point is to imply that there's an organic popularity to anything that involves Gabe

509
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
Hey people anytime you see anything that involves gay people existing on TV or in pop culture it's only

510
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
Only because special interest groups have

511
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,384
Paid off the producers to include that content

512
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:10,784
This isn't this blunt and clearly bigoted is him just saying that he hates gay people but this is no less homophobic

513
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:17,440
The mentality that is advancing is one that really does look at the public existence and popularity of media-related

514
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
The lgbtq issues or people

515
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
As a conspiracy with subversive aim

516
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
It's disgusting and this kind of thing should really be well remembered when Alex is doing is bulshit song and dance

517
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,032
In the present-day about always tolerant on gay issues but at same time

518
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
Violently auntie transhire

519
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,456
He's just faking whatever tolerance he present until it's safe for him to attack gay people again

520
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
That's

521
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,784
The song and dance the game that he's doing is

522
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Pathetic yeah and it should be

523
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,136
It should be so simple and easy

524
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,744
To see through any kind of like all the gay agenda with cultural

525
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Fine

526
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
I mean

527
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,864
Listen to a queen song Do you like that or not like that what do you

528
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
I would watch it out of culture

529
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
What do you want out of culture guess what

530
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
If you look at it

531
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
And honestly it's going to be a lot guy Freddie Mercury was only because the gay groups made him

532
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,224
Do it think I get them off of your favorite songs

533
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,552
40% made by somebody on the lgbtq space

534
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
A.

535
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
. at least

536
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Yeah

537
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,232
What he's doing is is pretty f***** up

538
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,864
And when you really look at it and you recognize that the story that he's basing this on is

539
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Just about like

540
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,216
Companies wanting to pay for

541
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,288
Product placement space on a popular

542
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
It's

543
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,640
It's remarkable that he's able to make this

544
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,968
Level of homophobic content of something

545
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
That has nothing to do with absolutely

546
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,696
Videos of this content

547
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:59,072
I got it could go back so much further just a listening somebody listening to like the f****** shadow

548
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
And hearing an ad for just

549
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:07,520
Baby wipes me and like all these women are putting ads on the goddamn stuff like I don't know

550
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
I bet they did I bet they did I bet there was a women's pant sad but maybe entire country explode for

551
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
A couple of weeks

552
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Yep

553
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Probably Christ

554
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,576
This isn't all that meaningful but I thought it was

555
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Kind of funny

556
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
About what

557
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,416
DeWalt

558
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
LOL

559
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
A good to talk to you

560
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
How you doing

561
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Listen.

562
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
I just had a little power

563
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
He says he doesn't know

564
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Who You Are

565
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Business

566
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Book

567
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Being advertised

568
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Sonic website

569
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
And

570
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Explain to him

571
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
Mistreated people on

572
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Tim Storey

573
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
I've had

574
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
So

575
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
That's heartbreaking

576
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,464
As heartbreaking as wife he knows who I am

577
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,864
11 is that about it now I know I would feel I would feel pretty terrible if somebody was your first sex

578
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,936
Ex-girlfriend she doesn't even remember your name anymore

579
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,008
That would break my heart

580
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
That's about the same

581
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
How much he cares

582
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
So this call

583
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,176
And we go to commercial

584
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
Commercial

585
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
Here's where

586
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
Alex says

587
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
About

588
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
Very

589
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
Griffin

590
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Overall

591
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:34,976
I'll call her I called and said that he had a personal conversation with Joseph Sarah that was insulting to me

592
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
I'm going to take you in one of my

593
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
Primary sources of information

594
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Tiberius

595
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
F******

596
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,728
No reason to do that just had to just

597
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,896
Could not stop himself from their likes no reason to believe that this color actually talk to Josie why aren't you

598
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,760
Nobody gives a s*** how dare you know what that daily sucks now

599
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
How about that

600
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,136
But you also is doing this so strategically where he can still like except

601
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,792
Like just using WorldNetDaily contact good writers still

602
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,192
Like a progressive DVD you know like all I love everything that they stand for I don't like the word Progressive or DEA so I'm going to get rid of them

603
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,056
It's it's entirely just a guy who's been wounded

604
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,640
Just lashing out excuse

605
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,712
Just stabbing people such a sad man

606
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
How do you spell pathetic

607
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,600
It is not even close to the levels of pathetic we're about to

608
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
Oh no it gets worse

609
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,976
I would say a large portion of this episode is

610
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,816
Circling around the idea of a Malcolm in the Middle

611
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,376
Episode that Alex has not watch

612
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
But someone emailed him about

613
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
Okay now hold on

614
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,776
If I understand this correctly

615
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Pre break

616
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Bad Cranston in

617
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
And that's what Infowars

618
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
A lot of it yet

619
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
So here is Alex

620
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
Complaining about this

621
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Episode of

622
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:07,392
Malcolm in the Middle

623
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Broadcast

624
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
You might

625
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
I brought up

626
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Dwight military

627
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
No way to find those out

628
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Breville

629
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
There is just like I've noticed a trend that I have kind of now

630
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,584
I'll listen to Alex on my response in my throw-up man

631
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
People doing

632
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,912
This is ridiculous oh yeah

633
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,240
So this episode of Malcolm in the Middle is called garage sale

634
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,568
Promise of the day

635
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
How

636
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
They're doing

637
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,408
They're having a garage sale strategy

638
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:39,808
Through the garage he finds his old radio transmitter that used in college

639
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:46,208
Talk about goings-on on campus

640
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:52,608
That's what you got to do to be cool yeah it's so he tries to recreate his old youth.

641
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
So he he

642
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,448
He takes back on the title of Kid Charlemagne

643
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,288
And starts ranting about that off

644
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:04,640
Kid Charlemagne he's sitting in like his backyard doing this

645
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:11,040
Doing this show

646
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
Get pulled over by the police for running a stop sign

647
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,416
Haha something to do with his show

648
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
And

649
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,744
He creates an entire campaign

650
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Against this the single stop sign

651
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,888
About the stop sign

652
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,216
Does not say the military industrial complex

653
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,544
He says the military-industrial country club complex

654
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
Because at the stop sign that the country club my coat in

655
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,504
Not even the garage sale ends up happening

656
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Yeah

657
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,320
I had somebody buys the transmitter

658
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
And so the dad

659
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,184
Gets in the car with the person to put the transmitter

660
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
So he can keep doing his show

661
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:57,376
And then if there's a black van following following them for doing it on

662
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
Unlicensed radio show

663
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,728
I need to do with like the contento putting out

664
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:06,336
He doesn't get dragged off into a van right that's the that's the central humor of it is that

665
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
He thinks it has something

666
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:12,480
Things to do with the content is it actually does it's just at the Pirate Radio Show that's not my

667
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:18,624
So if you were say somebody who I don't know has a radio show that you feel like

668
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Was lambasted

669
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Did buy that

670
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,744
Particular program the only reason that you would be lambasted

671
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
Where if utery

672
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
Where to react

673
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Did the exact same way that

674
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:34,240
Yes all is almost like Alex's embodying the thing that's being satirize

675
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,848
Act which is right really sad it's really sad

676
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,176
Right and I hit you in the face you're like I got hit in the face by

677
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:48,576
About a clown with a pie that's hilarious but whenever you run as fast as you can toward the pie and then slam

678
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,392
Why did the Cubs do this happen

679
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
Right and then you scream butt of the sea

680
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
Eyes are always in my face

681
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
It's just pathetic

682
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Man

683
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
I do

684
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
Can you imagine

685
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
How

686
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,616
Ridiculous it would be if every time I saw it like a

687
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:16,992
Movie with a podcast on it and they were like this idiot is an a****** and I was like I'm mad

688
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,392
The reason that you identify with that is if you are an a******

689
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,976
You bet yeah it's a little bit of self-consciousness coming out

690
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,584
Obviously later on there are instances of

691
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:38,240
TV characters even like Jay Jonah Jameson who are obviously

692
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,544
This is not a 2003

693
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,848
They were.

694
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,456
You'd be something worth satirizing is already like

695
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,552
Sort of an image of a pirate radio host

696
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
This did exist

697
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,624
In the Zeitgeist before Ali

698
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
Sealab 2021 had an episode of radio host

699
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,912
Newsradio

700
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,520
Something that predates Alex and I was just pretending it's all about himself

701
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
Does he's a sad

702
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,944
Sadman past the point where you should be doing psa's about credit card

703
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,064
Well you know be narcissistic about the level of Fame you want not about the level of Fame you have

704
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,672
You know what I'm saying that's why

705
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,304
Caller calls and describes the episode of Malcolm in the Middle

706
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,656
Alex is trying to make this really important

707
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Experience

708
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
W Morales

709
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Blue

710
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Well

711
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Garage door

712
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Business

713
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
Bi-Mart

714
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Stop sign

715
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,928
Is Alex going to look like

716
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,223
Well I

717
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Far as I can right now

718
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Violation

719
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,823
It's remarkable to think that people feel

720
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,127
Like folks like Alex can't take a joke

721
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,967
Yeah and this isn't even a joke directed at him no no no

722
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
Is this is so

723
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
F****** stupid yeah

724
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
That's that's

725
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,279
That's a radio show where you call into your grandma and explain movies to her

726
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
Alex is talking about let's be clear episode of Malcolm in the Middle

727
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:54,079
Kohler his scene analysis very seriously asking him what do the Men in Black Say

728
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
To the father

729
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,991
Yes against get some dialogue deal out of

730
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
Why

731
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,671
This is being treated as though it actually happened

732
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Tell me what the Men in Black said

733
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
The TV show that we were watch

734
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,959
What did the Men in Black say you mailed me about

735
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,799
Can I have third-hand information of

736
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,335
Jesus

737
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
What if

738
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,175
Petty loser

739
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
Oh my God

740
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:38,367
So I'm glad I grew up in the intervening 20 years

741
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,951
I was just two guests on the show one of them is Jack McLamb

742
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,303
Who started the police against the New World Order

743
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
I organization Patriot figure

744
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
About it right

745
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,335
He does bring up that he hasn't been a cop since 1986

746
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,919
When you were tired cuz he got injured in 1986

747
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,783
And that he says it's 22 years prior but it's 17 years prior

748
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,855
Discrepancy at the recess 22 multiple times

749
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
She was born in 1945

750
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
And so that means that he retired from the police at 41 years old yeah I believe

751
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Maybe give or take a year

752
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
And he was in the military

753
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:30,079
He was only a cop for like 10 years that he'd been a weirdo

754
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
Conspiracy theorist

755
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,407
Cashing in on this career IHOP

756
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,735
Right I always thought like this guy was a company who I am

757
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,391
Decades on the force and then retired with like this expertise and how everything works within the police

758
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,743
Call pretend ears maybe right like I know that's not

759
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,535
Like a short time but

760
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,607
It's not Stolen Valor but it's

761
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
It's

762
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,447
You borrowed without asking Valor

763
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
With that

764
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:04,383
Is it appears that he was probably a cop for a very short time got injured on the job and then has received a pension for the past 50

765
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
The goddamn years

766
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:12,063
With which he has running weird to see royalty fairy country

767
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,415
Except for the fact that I was like wait Smith is strange

768
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,791
Always thought that he was a cop much more recently than 1986

769
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,143
Oh man back in my day we used to only follow hunches

770
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
Poliisi man I saw this episode of Malcolm in the Middle about a Cop who retired 17 years ago

771
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
Wait a second

772
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
To his other guests

773
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Is this guy

774
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
We talked about this on a 2003 episode

775
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,831
Couple back the policy analysis Market

776
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Was the thing

777
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,695
That was putting together where they would have expert

778
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,743
Who could bet on

779
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,071
The idea of future things that could happen

780
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,399
Like leaked foreign leaders who would be deposed

781
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
Things like that it was a market-based approach to

782
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
Try to predict Ram

783
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,895
It was not a thing where people can make millions of dollars and Swiss bank accounts but that's the way Alex has covered it

784
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,455
Two Democratic senators

785
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,735
We're really mad about this

786
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,551
And so they brought attention to it and the project

787
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:22,207
I was canceled for it even beginning what I think you mean to say is that honorable far-right page

788
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
Patriots came together and their Louis

789
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
Voices were loud enough that

790
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,863
Those two Democratic senators were drowned

791
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,471
They still stop the bill anyway story there probably be told coming years

792
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,055
However Alex has a guy on who is created a parody

793
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,383
Of the policy analysis Market

794
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Run

795
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
I want to

796
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
Oh hey guess what

797
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,975
Even if the kids didn't get off the ground either but even if it did like

798
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:32,607
How does this not have the exact same problem that you're complaining about the dod for doing or DARPA for doing

799
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:39,007
Might have your somebody who's batting on a the government's going to pull a false flag

800
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,311
What's stopping you from doing it

801
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:47,967
Can't you just do that terrorist attack then cash it on it works the same stupid problem that Alex

802
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,247
Does identifying

803
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,551
Yeah you know when you bring it up like that

804
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
It makes sense

805
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,367
But on the other hand

806
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,463
How about we score minor political points for no reason on something that won't happen

807
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,583
Another project is closed

808
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,911
But there is an issue about how ads are set

809
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,703
I would like

810
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:15,103
Speakers urged his guests

811
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,895
I guess it does explain that

812
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Shut up

813
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Like a horse

814
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
So

815
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
The awesome

816
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Determined by how may

817
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
People

818
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
Directions

819
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,607
So freak sample

820
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,399
Call Butch

821
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
Which country were going to

822
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Falcon people that are

823
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
Hundred dollars each on

824
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Aron

825
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
100 people better

826
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Hundred dollars each

827
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
North Korea

828
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
12:50

829
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
In favor of

830
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
The Rock

831
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
That simple folks

832
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
Normal

833
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
Produce what the

834
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Pentagon

835
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
I hope

836
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
The odds that ever

837
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Any given

838
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
The collective

839
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Wisdom

840
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
The people who are

841
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Cruising in the mark

842
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:26,527
This is entirely stupid because it actually does the opposite

843
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:31,903
888 the cuts out the entire point of the policy analysis Market which was

844
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,231
It would only be open to people who have expertise

845
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
And then it would be a market-based

846
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Friend

847
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,191
Forecaster in theory based on people who have expertise and a lot of knowledge around

848
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,751
Policy issues around 4 in

849
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,543
Relations issues

850
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:55,199
By opening it up to people who are just looking to gamble or whatever

851
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,807
To the information that you'd be able to derive from it

852
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,951
The second barely the issue that you have with this is like what country were going to attack next North Korea or Iran

853
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,119
What happens if the house get the money obviously there's a big

854
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
Like the house get something naturally get a taste of course otherwise what's the point of running

855
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,663
Really if you look at it is this guy doing an ad for his gambling operation

856
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Grift

857
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,575
What are you talkin

858
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
This is one of those

859
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:39,487
So stupid ideas that you have to stop somebody before they start trying to talk about it

860
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,303
Cuz they are try you can see clearly him

861
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,911
See him like a horse right he's trying to explain it to himself in a way that

862
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:52,543
Sound incredibly stupid

863
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
What is happening

864
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
Yeah yeah

865
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:59,455
Hey here's what we're going to do like that's another thing with the original Pollo

866
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
The original pan

867
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
You know it's like

868
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:06,111
That is only something that incredibly smart people would think up

869
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:12,511
To avoid doing the thing that they already know is the actual solution you know like if you wanted to if you wanted

870
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
To do good stuff for everybody you could

871
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,863
But that doesn't make you personally as much money

872
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,007
So let's try eight market-based idea of how to figure out whether or not a war is going to happen

873
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
Not like let's not fight Wars

874
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:31,455
Sprite and it may not be in a surly if a war is going to happen but regions where there is the most likely

875
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,527
Play Outburst

876
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,879
I think that actually this color does

877
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,927
Really highlight or not color

878
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,023
If you was like a collar but he's a gas now it does highlight

879
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,327
How bad of an idea this is

880
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
Yeah

881
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,191
The the policy analysis Market itself

882
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
Makes sense

883
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,751
Subway

884
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,543
Because it makes sense

885
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,591
Inferior

886
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,919
Yes that's a better way products

887
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
Only makes sense

888
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
Because of the restricted user pool

889
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
It doesn't make sense right

890
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,343
Bass

891
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,415
Is the version that Alex is recovering and Reporting

892
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Drake version of it where it's like

893
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,999
I get rich scheme for me

894
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,815
For people who are whatever

895
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,655
That doesn't make sense

896
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,703
Gambling market for people

897
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,263
Like it it does reveal have dumb

898
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,103
Short squeeze

899
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:37,759
All the people who bet against the war lost are there

900
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
Full like

901
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:44,927
Isn't this fire me to bring this guy on here to take your money in a different way I just don't understand

902
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Absurd

903
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
Sunnyway this episode

904
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Thin

905
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,935
It's like quite bring it too much Beyond in the middle

906
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:02,335
Not a lot going on and honestly you know with the waiting for Alex to show up I thought

907
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Thought you be back

908
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
And so

909
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,407
You know that

910
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,967
