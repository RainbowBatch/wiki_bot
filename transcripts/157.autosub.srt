1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
In this month of May where Jordan is doing a whole lot of stand-up at the

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,016
I'ma try and fill my favorite folks

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
One of the best

5
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Mardi Gras

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
Good to be back welcome I'd like this we got on we got you on camera in this the sleeveless shirt

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,584
Oh s*** I've no idea for all their guns

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,144
I thought I actually was identified with Jordan

9
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
Two nights ago

10
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
And I told him at some point

11
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
You do know a little bit about that

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
We've gotten this criticism from listeners and everytime I come up

13
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
I think it's kind of fun

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,368
It just kind of the relative knowledge

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,488
Sure you know a little bit more probably than Jordan

16
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
Ivan keys

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,864
He knows more summer immersion

18
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,704
Also forgets a lot though

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,776
And even for me to a certain extent like it's kind of just like

20
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,848
We process this stuff we react to it in like

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,248
I've had listeners asked me like what episode

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
With my pocket

23
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
Anybody familiar with Alec

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
Congratulations you guys put out Episode 99

25
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,584
Important to celebrate 100

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Libra

27
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Give me five years to

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,192
To do

29
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
The proper amount of

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,544
Yeah that's that's what happens when you get down to business

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,616
Protector protect the businesses best

32
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Is possible

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
I've noticed Alex I think

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,064
That you're probably on the same page with me

35
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
I think I'm the right

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
I was very

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Before

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
You know Trump took office

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Kind of just ruined

40
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,864
Yeah I know funneh the good name

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
Muskox

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
I think also that.

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Conspiracy Theory videos

44
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Have been

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
They're just not as fun anymore it's so important to Stephanie goof around with

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Just like

47
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Yeah

48
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
You know and then

49
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Listen.

50
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,672
The stuff that my favorite was a couple episodes back on

51
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Canary claims

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,520
Your goddamn job I would say because you're an expert in other fields

53
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,104
Such as the wrestling field

54
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Wrestling

55
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Torn maybe sure

56
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:04,064
I don't need to ask any questions about that. Okay

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,624
At all as we like the changing of

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
50 videos

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,768
With this latest event in Saudi Arabia the greatest Royal Rumble

60
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
See much how you're probably like

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Completely

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Unfazed by anything Alex does

63
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
Or can I can't be shot a shotgun

64
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Yeah I can't be shot

65
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Are there such a carrot

66
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
They talk out of both sides of their mouth

67
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
The Bell Pat themselves on the back

68
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Belmont

69
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,296
Yeah wasn't I mean wasn't even Stephanie McMahon's quote they're like philanthropy is the new marketing

70
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,648
Yeah is two-sided

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
You know there's just a whole lot of stuff

72
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Like that word

73
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Women aren't allowed

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Vape that the Saudis

75
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Whoever's in charge

76
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
The Saudi royal family or whoever was

77
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Had to put on an apology

78
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Because an ad for back

79
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
Play the chode women

80
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
We are when I I saw something on like that Reddit squared-circle

81
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
It was like

82
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Apology made

83
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Greatest

84
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,648
Thinking maybe next time we will bring women here and

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
You know they wrestled in the have an interesting conversation.

86
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:23,935
Yeah and then

87
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
No they were like a sorry that there was a video that you saw woman arms

88
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
Stomach and super nice butt

89
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Besari

90
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
But yeah and it's just you know

91
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
It's just

92
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
And they got

93
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
I'm hearing

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Hundreds of

95
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Millions undoubtedly

96
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
The staff thrown around of like 25 million or 60 million about the single of

97
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,447
But considering it's part of a 10-year deals imagine it's not in the hunt

98
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
But I mean I don't know

99
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
I see I see two sides of It kind of with the like

100
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Hey

101
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Maybe this will work

102
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
To help make things better in the future

103
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
But I also don't

104
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
Trust that when did the company run by crazy Vince McMahon right and his going to his wife is in the Trump Administration

105
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
So much time doing Faithfully Saudi propaganda on the actual show

106
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
David Meltzer who is

107
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
You nobody will call the Dan Friesen of

108
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
But the in in in the

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
The newest wrestler

110
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
Observer newsletter

111
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
He says three years ago Sammy's in russellton

112
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
And now he's not allowed back in

113
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
So it's like how is that price

114
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
That's not

115
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
Certainly he bought some for the severity of this situation

116
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,959
I don't know man it's kind of foolish to think of

117
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
They being I got a tool for Progress considering the EMT Progressive people behind

118
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
Those pictures of like the Undertaker and Curtis

119
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Durango and Brock and Vince

120
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,951
What the f*** those things like I imagined like the Undertaker like Kurt Angle taking a piss

121
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Get ourselves

122
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,887
Brother

123
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
Style

124
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
I think it's weird

125
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
Some people comment on it cuz there's a

126
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
There's some wrestling

127
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
People have said that like

128
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
It's pretty wild the idea that

129
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
They allowed

130
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,575
Iranian flag to be flown

131
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
Personally

132
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
The Brother show

133
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
He was

134
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
With cv1 play the terrorist years ago Muhammad assigns manager

135
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,447
That introduces a whole nother layer

136
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Sure so he

137
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
He have been auntie

138
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Pushing buttons for a long

139
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Long time

140
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
Yeah they went there and then re-add to put out a

141
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
A tweet like hey I play a role

142
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Yeah

143
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
So I mean

144
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
San Mateo vet they're still probably part of every wrestler who's

145
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
Yeah I still think there's that part of Russia

146
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
I felt that way when I was

147
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:40,031
But no no

148
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
In India rank

149
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
It's Pakistani

150
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
I mean I'm sure they

151
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
But that same

152
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
You don't like the bad guys in America

153
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
We're famous for it weren't Chicago okay with coming on Brett Favre jerseys back in the day they're also going to call

154
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
Call Evert cheesehead

155
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Going back and watching

156
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
Awesome old stuff and I'll be to watch like the

157
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
The rise of stone cold or this crazy match they had or whatever

158
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
Bowser watching everyone else will be like oh my God

159
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
The worst I'd ever

160
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
Worthy

161
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
Yeah but using a method of getting heat on somebody or whatever

162
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
The one-off

163
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Super Show

164
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
And second country yeah

165
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,175
Killing each other I think that's what it's like they've gotten a little too far there

166
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
Also not like it's not like there's a

167
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:58,623
Literal Turf War sports teams in America

168
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Is

169
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
You know cuz they were there was that sumo

170
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
Well they wanted you

171
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Book test

172
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Now

173
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,799
Oh okay so a couple friends who are just like no no no no

174
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847

00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
I was talking to you

176
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
My buddy Mike

177
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Comedy

178
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Wrestling fan

179
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
Sure but he was like

180
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
I think there's like some like

181
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Like little Sally Prince

182
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
Geto Boys it's just like

183
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,439
And I want this match and I want this match and I want 50 men in the Royal Rumble engine

184
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
He's booking it on his own sound like

185
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Remember the names

186
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,423
The kids from Willy Wonka

187
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Surprised there wasn't no regard

188
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,567
Nevermind

189
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
With those guys

190
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Victorville

191
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Come out then

192
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Do you think you can cut it here

193
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
You hear from Saudi Arabia you're not going

194
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Cut it here

195
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,207
They could have gotten like the anti or the bad guy

196
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,583
Villain from America if it got in the exact same effect

197
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,887
Being a set-piece now where it's

198
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,727
Kind of a roni

199
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
As a as a set-piece as a skit

200
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
Weird territory to walk especially

201
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
The company is owned by someone who's married to a member of trump

202
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
The cabinet

203
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
I still give

204
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Like

205
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
Linda a pass cuz I still think she's a nice lady

206
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,535
Linda she's the most harmless one she's not like

207
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
This is

208
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
Is the Linda leftover sympathy from that time when

209
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
I will say though it is kind of funny that she

210
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Secretary of Smallville

211
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
Yeah they make all the wrestlers

212
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Contractors

213
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
Small businesses in the form of breast

214
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
He's out of business

215
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
When they roll into town.

216
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Get up tell the city

217
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
Okay don't let other places

218
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Is Havanese

219
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Irina is no commitment that milk

220
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Stop

221
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
Small business east

222
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
You know

223
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
We still watched

224
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Yeah

225
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
I still watch a little bit still

226
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,943
Valex in modern-day

227
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,527
Cuz I just came through moment where I was like everything is a distraction

228
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
Everything is b******* this is all nonsense

229
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
I'm posting on our group on Facebook about like

230
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,607
Oh my God he's getting in a fight with Ben Shapiro coming on the show

231
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,495
And I keep trying to express the people enjoy whatever they want that's fine but like

232
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
This is nothing

233
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
This is all a distraction Sheriff was going on and there's no content on

234
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,039
On his show anymore far as I can tell

235
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,927
What's just open up the couple web pages what's going on talk about it

236
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
Hibiscus before we can judge

237
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
I think he thinks he's an idiot

238
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Okay

239
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
Does Alex make it seem like they're boys

240
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:26,751
Drudge came on the show in 2015 little experience from the Shadows

241
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
Camera but you had a Mike he was off camera somewhere

242
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
And he was telling Alex

243
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Summer Freddy 2020

244
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
He's very secretive

245
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
Pictures of em on the internet

246
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,415
You telling how it's all this unbelievable b******* like 1T actually told Alex was

247
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Litwin

248
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
The powers-that-be the globalist created Vince Russo

249
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
No the other one wrestling in the globalist New World

250
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,591
The right to censor is certainly relevant

251
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Their violation

252
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
I'll beat you was telling Alex they when they

253
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Created Isis

254
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
They make them

255
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,599
Because they were trying to demonize Daryl Aisa

256
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Who's in Congress

257
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
Name of the enemy of the regime

258
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
That's fun

259
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,303
He couldn't even keep a straight face while he wasn't joking

260
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
He was trying to get Alex to take the bait on the narrative

261
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,447
And it's pretty clear that he looks at Alex's like someone who

262
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
He's got a patronize a little bit with like throwing blanks and stuff like that

263
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Yeah I think that's the relation

264
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Did they have

265
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
After watching

266
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
That Rodger Stone

267
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
That really bummed

268
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
I just like

269
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
Like there's times where I felt like we talked about

270
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
The Forum

271
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
Man these show should have

272
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Have you on

273
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
To be in someone's ear

274
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Ewing Alex like

275
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
Megyn Kelly was like interviewing of you could have been

276
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
And just like like hey

277
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
That's not true and ask him

278
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
That was the case

279
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Why do you say this

280
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
And you think

281
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
Wow

282
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:10,175
It's like that Megyn Kelly interview

283
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
It's a right question

284
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
And then it lied to nothing and then when they added it they have to make it look

285
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,159
Somewhat presentable

286
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Media training

287
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
4

288
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
And if you do I don't know

289
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Maybe there's

290
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Just like study

291
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
That Rodger Stone

292
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Feel like this

293
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
Why

294
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Bacon

295
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Trick you guys so much

296
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
Enjoy watching

297
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,567
There's no good faith

298
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Who's the guy

299
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
His other Michael Brooks

300
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
That guy

301
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Knows how to handle those

302
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
Smart lift Barbie enough

303
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
I like this guy

304
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,071
I like this guy details of policy imitator both are really good at

305
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,447
Really end up getting people trapped like especially particularly libertarian

306
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Whenever they have conversations

307
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
They always get stuck

308
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
In some

309
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,407
Big problem with libertarian ideology

310
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,503
Where we're going

311
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
If you watch that entire libertarian debate

312
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:25,439
I recommend everybody watch it it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life

313
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Hilarious

314
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
It's it's

315
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
If they do a patreon exclusive

316
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
Each other

317
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,007
Are you at the rent too damn High guy

318
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
About this

319
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
John McAfee trying to sound

320
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Real

321
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Relevant

322
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Yeah

323
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Who's who

324
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,015
Gary Johnson

325
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Geese teams

326
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,719
So reasonable

327
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Combination

328
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,815
Funny you should bring that up

329
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:08,703
We've been talking about libertarian libertarian wrestling Alex Jones

330
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
And the intersection of those three things

331
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Is an episode of Alex Jones Show

332
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
But see what you think about that

333
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Wrestling Entertainment

334
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,879
He is well-known around the world

335
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:33,279
Underhill

336
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
Criminal

337
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
Who discovered and we are as well

338
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,663
A free-market educational organization

339
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623
Pop culture to spread the message of Liberty

340
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,023
As well as appearing on various television

341
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
Josh

342
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,007
And he is with us today I love the speech and I saw you the other day

343
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
Meeting on C-Span

344
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
Obamacare and the attacks

345
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,319
Now rolling on the streets of America

346
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,631
Did that years ago like to have fun very fun things

347
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
We're do some comedy from time to time

348
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,311
I would also love it if you did the interview in case or he would have to know

349
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
Bad news Caden appears on Alex to incorporate

350
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,319
2013

351
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Yeah okay

352
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
I do not have time to look into exactly the storyline he would have been involved in

353
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
2013

354
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Well

355
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
Probably deppe

356
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
No

357
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
That that was like

358
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
20

359
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Okay

360
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
I don't know

361
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Be wrong

362
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
That was like

363
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
I guessing that was like

364
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
Might be anger anger management years

365
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:35,391
Ryder John Cena little quadrangle

366
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
I mean who knows whatever it was something stupid

367
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,119
I'm going to predict sure storylines from years past I'm going to guess

368
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
Real.

369
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,007
Did you took it you know that Cain had appeared on Alex Jones Show

370
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Did not but I am not

371
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
Surprised I know he'd been on other shows

372
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
Hi

373
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Before that's crazy

374
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
Talking about

375
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Yeah

376
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,135
Whenever I heard him talking about a wrestler and take you to Peter down a bunch

377
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
Shows

378
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
You could give that credit to like John Bradshaw Layfield

379
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:21,983
Yeah he had his own black syndicated radio show we talked about economics and stuff like that

380
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
More credible but

381
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
We got the we got the demon

382
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
The devil's favorite demon

383
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
Is so f****** weird

384
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
While

385
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,319
So In that clip you would have heard Alex McCain

386
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
I'm not going to Colin Quinn

387
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
Kane

388
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Awakening

389
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
Due to the Austrian School of economics

390
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,887
MD Von mises Institute

391
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
Alex doesn't have the name right

392
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,031
But you wouldn't know what that is

393
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
And I'm going to be a real

394
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
Public American

395
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
It's about

396
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,039
So much people as it is I think stupid okay

397
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
And maybe some of the effects of it are end up being evil but I'ma give you a quick rundown of the Austrian

398
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
O'Hare

399
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:20,863
Here's the too long didn't read version of it up top these guys are a bunch of f****** dick okay

400
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,239
The roots of the Austrian School seems mostly based in a strong hatred of f.d.r.

401
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
His social programs

402
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
Collective larger than the state

403
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Which is

404
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
Libertarian

405
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
I always have real trouble trying to understand like why do you hate the federal government

406
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
The state

407
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
When what is the federal government budget

408
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Just stay in the mall Ganesha

409
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Of State

410
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Shouldn't you hate

411
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
The city or the state in like the city

412
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,423
And then what about the district and the city or household

413
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
That's what you really come down to us

414
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,287
They want everyone to have their own laws

415
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,919
Austrian School of Economics they subscribe to the Austrian business cycle Theory

416
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,783
Which states the central bank's control the business cycle through intentional booms and busts

417
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
By manipulating interest

418
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
When they make the interest rates low to give out a lot of credit to people with creative bubble destined to birth

419
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
First and that leads to a recession

420
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Central banks are the evil one

421
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
But

422
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:29,472
They failed to mention that there were tons of Cycles before the Federal Reserve or central banks were ever introduced

423
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,080
The solution that they generally offer for gold

424
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
Peter Schiff who is a frequent guest on Alex Jones Show is appropriate a prominent Austrian style like

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,088
Not surprisingly he has his own operation

426
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
I also you know Piazza frequent guest on Alex's show witch's indicated by a man who owns a gold and silver

427
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Company

428
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
For twenty years

429
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
Another famous gold sales

430
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,424
Tell him that close he's broken guitars in the wrestling business

431
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,752

432
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,336
Slapnuts gold Double J was starting Global Force wrestling

433
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688

00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Get s*** done

00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
He can key is the guy to get shot

437
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
His wrestling career has just been

438
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Tubelight

439
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Outside of derbies bobblehead

440
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Everywhere he's gone

441
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
Even back in the day

442
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
But even within a you telling me that story while back cuz I was watching back through I don't know

443
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,616
Extorted the WWE

444
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
Was ending

445
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
If you do China they were this good

446
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,320
Embarrassing very embarrassing everyone

447
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
If I'm going to lose

448
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
To China

449
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
You can hit me with a mop I'm getting

450
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
A lot of my

451
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Abasing made him

452
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Years worth of

453
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Music I need

454
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Tell the wife

455
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
It's in the bank

456
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Alright let's do it

457
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
Bethel got a car in a gyro covered in

458
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Is big

459
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
And

460
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
And then it was a big enough

461
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Okay

462
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Buy gold

463
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,136
From Global Force vaguely remember that

464
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,696
But I remember like people that work there

465
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
Guys what

466
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Weeden

467
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Now what

468
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
Yeah it is

469
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
Takeoff it's crazy but you start to notice this real trend of what they call gold-bug

470
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:46,432
We're just selling gold and confused with skulduggery

471
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Nefarious

472
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Action

473
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
The

474
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,624
Conspiracy in libertarian worlds you'll just fine

475
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,464
People who are telling you to buy gold it's the only safe thing to do

476
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,560
And you scratch beneath the surface a little bit you find a financial interest in gold,

477
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Huh

478
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
And it's weird but we're going to talk a little bit more about that little bit later okay because I did some looking into it and I found the roots

479
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Will Alex slippers

480
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Tough guy

481
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
Weather

482
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968

484
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
He's going to mention that

485
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,512
You know you want to make a bingo

486
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Vype

487
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,632
Dimension Devon Erickson Texas

488
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:43,776
I think he's going to

489
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
Mention

490
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
Rocks Don't color

491
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Apocalypse

492
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
Where the hulkster is

493
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,064
You know what you would not get Bingo I'll tell you that right now but I want

494
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,416
I don't know I don't want to give him a ride. Alright alright

495
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:07,072
So back to school real quick and other people other like

496
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
Schools of economics

497
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Chicago score

498
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
Anyways other

499
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Schools of thought

500
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:17,824
Guys that they believe that individual choices and actions of the only relevant factors in economics

501
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
Statistics of economic modeling

502
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,760
Statistics exactly crazy because they believed that Society can't act

503
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
Society of the person only person

504
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Boy okay

505
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
Find whatever

506
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,536
Empirical evidence

507
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
Willfully obtuse

508
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Because they

509
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
I think that

510
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,216
Statistics empirical evidence

511
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
Are biased because people make decisions

512
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
They cannot be captured

513
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Vixen models

514
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
In reality they do this by

515
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
Because it is not a school of economics

516
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,784
It's a front to push severe in ridiculous libertarian politics out

517
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
As an economic theory

518
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,696
When you look into it a little bit most of the players such as well and Murray rothbard

519
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,536
Those are two major players in the Austrian School of economics

520
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,656
They are having organizations like the Cato Institute

521
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:18,240
A deeply troubling ties to the John Birch Society

522
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Emirichu a quote

523
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
About rothbard here

524
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,224
Ross Barra faction since 90

525
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
1846

526
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,696
Rothbart

527
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,352
Describes himself as a member of the old right faction since 1946

528
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,960
Was it Jewish New Yorkers supported Strom Thurmond states rights party in 1948

529
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,080
Conservative success in establishing themselves as the only alternative

530
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,664
Rothbard called for a Resurgence of the old right to quote

531
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Fuel the 20th century

532
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,272
Alator Alliance

533
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
Limited to what he considered good libertarian

534
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:10,208
As described in the 1990 issue of the John Birch Society is New American Magazine

535
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,072
This would mean purging undesirable elements from the libertarian party including quote

536
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
Hippies druggies

537
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,448
Antinomian zand militantly anti-christian atheist

538
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,264
If you don't know what else

539
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
If you don't know what antinomian czar

540
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,384
They're people who believe in the New Testament of the Bible

541
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
Specifically the Jesus is Grayson sacrifice were fulfillment of the law and freed people from Moses's Old Testament law

542
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,184
He wants to purge people from the party who don't subscribe to Old Testament law

543
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
That sounds very much.

544
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Legos libertarian values Iver

545
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,584
Absolutely what you want to do

546
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,912
Don't eat shellfish

547
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:56,032
Oh no

548
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,104
Debate the viability of states seceding from the Union

549
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
Which they are really into

550
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
El Super in

551
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Sure

552
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Denise Institute

553
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,088
Is based on a major player what are the

554
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
Intellectual grandfathers

555
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
That was a major player

556
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
Austrian School of economics

557
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
It was named after him

558
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
Any sort of beat what one of the big

559
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
Think tanks

560
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
Publishing houses for

561
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
These

562
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
Weirdo libertarian ideas

563
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,184
Masquerading as school of economic thought

564
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,488
I don't know I want to

565
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
I read a bunch of

566
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Public post

567
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,216
Spider meets Institute but they're like soda policy position and all of them

568
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,288
It's going to be too much

569
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
I'm getting know what I'm going to do is I'm going to read you one and then a little bit later

570
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,504
If you can hear just how f****** stupid

571
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
People are okay

572
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,832
I'm going to start with the other take on a Christmas

573
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Carol okay

574
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,208
You don't get no That's a classic Christmas movie sure you got screwed

575
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Yeah you got the ghost

576
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
She got Marley Jacob Marley

577
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Money and beer

578
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
It's not the message they took away from it

579
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,312
Titanic now they're really like it being cool to be a miser

580
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
In the store money

581
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,712
Because they believe basically that if you saved buddy that's investment in future thing

582
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Which is good

583
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,880
When in reality there's a people Gathering up billions of dollars that isn't being circulated doesn't help anybody

584
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,696
So they believe that actually the Bob Cratchit

585
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
VA employee

586
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Is the villain

587
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
Christmas parade

588
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Scrooge from

589
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,448
Because he's he's making undue demands

590
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,752
Just by virtue of his existence

591
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:05,312
Unscrew has every right to his money

592
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Here's a quote from their write-up about it

593
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:13,248
So let's look without preconceptions at Scrooge's allegedly underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit

594
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
The fact is if Cratchit skills were worth more to anyone than the fifteen Shillings weekly there would be someone

595
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
To offer it to him

596
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,792
Thugs no one hasn't said scratch its profit-maximizing boss is hardly a man to pay for nothing

597
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,608
Scratch it must be worth exactly is present wages

598
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,680
No doubt Cratchit needs is a want

599
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,752
More to support his family and care for Tiny Tim

600
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,360
But Scrooge did not pour scratch it to father children he's having difficulty supporting

601
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:46,016
If Gretchen had children while suspecting he would be unable to afford them not screwed is responsible for their plight

602
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:51,648
And if didn't know how expensive they would be why am I screwed assumed the burden of cratchit's misjudge

603
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,816
That's for that one lump of coal Scrooge allows him it Bears emphasis the Cratchit has not been changed his chili desk

604
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
If he stays there

605
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,168
He shows by his behavior that he prefers his present wages

606
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Comfort package

607
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,544
To any other he has found or supposes himself likely to find

608
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
Actions speak louder than grumbling

609
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,456
And the reader can hardly complain about what Cratchit evidently find satisfactory

610
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
This sounds like

611
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
What I really nice

612
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Nice Republican with

613
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
McDonald's

614
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,648
If you don't like it go get a better job

615
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:30,048
You don't work here you stay wherever you are while you're being attacked

616
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Stop having them.

617
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
Kids yeah

618
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,192
Especially ones that come out

619
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,056
Charles Dickens wrote Christmas Carol

620
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
Look at Charles Dickens

621
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,504
He was born into like a well-to-do family too much money

622
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
1824

623
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
His dad Father John

624
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
Was committed to a debtors prison

625
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
And London because he owed too much money

626
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
That point

627
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Dickens was

628
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
12 years old

629
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,120
He was forced upon his collection of books leave school and go to work at a shoe black and Factory

630
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
A dirty and rat-infested Factory

631
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,800
The change in circumstances gave him what his biography of Michael's

632
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Personal

633
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
And social outrage

634
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
Which influenced his works

635
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,504
Because Charles Dickens lived the reality of these hypothetical bulshit thing

636
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,600
But these dumbasses at the Von mises Institute are talkin about

637
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,184
Himself exactly everything was fine up till 10

638
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
On those books and go black some shoes

639
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
And I say hi to rats

640
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Bucked up

641
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
Gamble on himself

642
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Haha

643
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Absolute

644
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
But he you know

645
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
Ryan

646
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,456
Is work ended up having like a really socially-conscious vent to it be

647
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Because

648
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
He experienced

649
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Child labor

650
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
Experience

651
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
Debtor prison stuff like that crazy how

652
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
You can look at anything

653
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
And be like

654
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
My take on that and everybody else

655
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,584
Like somebody shared a meme

656
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Are you off

657
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,472
I'm on but only to really use our group I don't really

658
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
I don't engage much

659
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
Somebody post

660
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
A meme

661
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
That

662
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Clearly

663
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Lunatics

664
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Is the guy who stopped

665
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Yeah yeah

666
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Shooter at Waffle

667
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
With his bare hands

668
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
So next time

669
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Cops

670
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Next

671
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Intimidated by

672
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Play blackmail mix

673
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,120
Helicopter

674
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Who boy

675
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Think twice about that

676
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:49,824
Wow that's hot

677
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,872
Yeah this is I mean did I

678
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
Heroically in the face of Catholic

679
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Are there mutants

680
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,392
But that's the world we live in now you have this

681
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Just like

682
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Is that what it was

683
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Two words just like

684
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
I'd never let my

685
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
I could watch that in your like wine

686
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
Because of this business you're like

687
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Where did you go

688
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,984
Christmas carols oppressing Scrooge like this

689
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
Top music

690
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Little better

691
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Interesting

692
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,224
I could see an argument against Christmas Carol again

693
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,528
Some of the material is a minute

694
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
Like a goose

695
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,672
Yeah I don't know I'm trying to rip some complain I don't really have one

696
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,512
I don't know I don't like Christmas much so it's never been my favorite butt

697
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Yeah this argument

698
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Stupid

699
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
As it turns out

700
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Glenn Jacobs

701
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680

The interview and here's what

703
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,616
What do you want to talk about

704
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,024
Libertarian and economic circles right now

705
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,728
First of all

706
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
That's interesting

707
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,664
That's really fun that you like competing currencies Glenn Jacobs also known as came

708
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,456
I keep forgetting to call and Kane

709
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
Here's the thing

710
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Everybody other glibertarians loves talked about

711
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Competing currency

712
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
Please know that s***

713
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,536
Government free currency

714
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
Electro gold

715
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,168
Spoiler alert in the Austrian School anime

716
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Student

717
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
And even

718
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
Kane is going to say this later

719
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,616
Bitcoin's great

720
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
That sort of thing

721
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm so interested

722
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
Competing currencies

723
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
Did you know that we've tried that before

724
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
We've tried this

725
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,184
So early in our history individual Banks printed their own currency

726
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,256
Which word exchangeable for gold and silver

727
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
Before the passage of the national Banking Act in 1863 up to 8,000 different entities issued

728
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
Their own money

729
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Just different banks

730
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
You had tons of banks

731
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
You guys take a

732
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,824
Chase money here

733
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,736
Cuz there's a whole situation where like

734
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,600
Charters for banks in the United States like New York and a couple others

735
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
They just had Free banking if we could just

736
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,184
Make up your own bank or whatever

737
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,512
I want to print out some sort of promissory note

738
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
In order to like

739
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,632
Have people have your currency

740
00:36:53,888 --> 00:37:00,032
Interstate Commerce Act like I've Got a New York

741
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Work dollar here

742
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
And it's worth in New York but if I go to Michigan let's say maybe they only accept

743
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:12,064
Now your money is worth less in different places

744
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
It's absolutely insane

745
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Also

746
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
Who knows

747
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
Who honors what currency

748
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,792
You might end up in a place where you got tons of buck

749
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
Like

750
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,472
Are they going to be honored at every store in West Virginia

751
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Who knows

752
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,336
Also a comically easy to counterfeit money

753
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
Except

754
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,736
Cuz there's so many of course so many f****** currencies

755
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Look at it I D from

756
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
Indiana here in Illinois they look at it like 4

757
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
What is today

758
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,928
Any fake is good out of say it

759
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,512
Absolutely you can or you can't possibly train people to

760
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Be able to tell if he like

761
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
This is valid currency complete Madness

762
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
So of course

763
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
This

764
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,264
National Banking Act of 1863 habitat

765
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
63

766
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,176
It was right in the middle of the Civil War so historical revisionist look back on the app doesn't temp by Lincoln

767
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,992
To centralize power in and states rights

768
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
But in reality it was trying to save

769
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
The entire

770
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
Try to knock off the b*******

771
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
Interesting bit of trivia do Marty

772
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,840
The Confederate States also printed and on their bills

773
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,704
Which kind of hurts their argument that slavery was not an important piece of the secession

774
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Also

775
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,032
Two US presidents were featured on their money

776
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,128
Two presidents who mysteriously the right-wing and Alex Jones

777
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
It's their favorite

778
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
George Washington

779
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Editor Jackson we're on

780
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
Confederate money

781
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Yeah

782
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
I think they are

783
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,392
Pictures of

784
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
You know like it made it look like

785
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
Slavery wasn't so bad

786
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,840
David sort of a Kanye West Selah

787
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:05,984
Also has lost almost 50% of its value in the last 5 months

788
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Also 1000% increase in value in the five months before that

789
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,944
It's a completely inconsistent currency

790
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
Is very dangerous

791
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
And if you don't have money to lose you

792
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Competing currencies

793
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Before and it does not work

794
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
It doesn't it's not

795
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,512
There's even more evidence of this

796
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
If your if your came

797
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
And Alex

798
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
It's kind of like

799
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,888
Have you out he has you on his show

800
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Adidas like so

801
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
We will talk about

802
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,800
When you going to be like I don't know man it's your show why don't you f******

803
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:46,176
Figure it out

804
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
Say something okay

805
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
But also

806
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,160
Another thing with its Monopoly of currency thing is the Federal Reserve System

807
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
And another libertarian

808
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
F****** hate that Federal Reserve

809
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Think about

810
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Is that

811
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
The reason that

812
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
Federal Reserve exist

813
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,448
Is it between 1836

814
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,008
1913 we didn't have a central bank

815
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,104
The second American Bank Charter ended

816
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,968
Until 1913 we didn't start up another one which comes in the form of the Federal Reserve System

817
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Isn't One Bank

818
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
12

819
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,296
District Banks

820
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
Better run by a board

821
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,208
There's another f****** thing

822
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
But like

823
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,632
To audit them just not you might want

824
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,776
It's not like they're not being audited at all that there might be no money in there or something like that but

825
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
So here's the thing

826
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,408
The reason that it started in 1913

827
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
It's because we had

828
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
Major Financial panic

829
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,600
In 1873 which lasted a couple years 1884 18

830
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
80s

831
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
I got eighteen eight

832
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
1893 Attica juxtapose couple numbers

833
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
307

834
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,032
Since 1913 we've only had truly

835
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
Three major Financial panic

836
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
In 100 years

837
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
As opposed

838
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
6

839
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,712
The week periods in that 34 year span

840
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
It is done in

841
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:30,368
Incredibly well good ratio

842
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,952
This money goes up as money goes down

843
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:39,840
What are you going to do how are you going to protect people the Financial Federal Reserve System is done a spectacular job

844
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,192
Other complaints that you can make about it some of them might be valid but in terms of Psych

845
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Protecting people

846
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
And their assets

847
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
It's done

848
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
That's okay

849
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
It is

850
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,199
And Alex is trying to come in with a cattle prod

851
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
Kane is going to pay a little bit more about that

852
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:09,023
I have

853
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:15,679
On the market

854
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,527
Where's the beef

855
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,647
Economic history

856
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,887
Because of what they are and I really feel bad

857
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Bitcoin

858
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:52,543
Inference

859
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,063
Monopoly

860
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:10,207
Very well said plush

861
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:21,471
Independent

862
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:31,455
We've got to have some concerned investing

863
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Other than gold

864
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,831
Do we have any concerns about investigating anything other than gold

865
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,135
Golden rules

866
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
Jerker Goldberg

867
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,023
Pick-n-Pull back we're back to that

868
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,935
I don't know man I think that they're trying to sort of dance around the issue that all cultures have valued

869
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Precious metals

870
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:59,103
Yeah we're not taking into account that like a lot of them didn't have a monetary value for them they just valid them cuz they were shiny

871
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
You'd end up with cultures

872
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
I mean even in

873
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
Fairly modern times it would have

874
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
Gold ever to be like

875
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
Temecula

876
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,903
I don't think it looks nice

877
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
Or whatever

878
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,023
Gold bro

879
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
No-go

880
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,167
Need to know nevermind

881
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
I got

882
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:32,383
The idea of going back to the gold standard is really appealing to these people like Cain and Alex Jones which is a weird group

883
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,455
I never thought we'd there's someone

884
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
B of A

885
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Doomsday prepper

886
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Type of men

887
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,367
Roped in there

888
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,439
No they're victims of a really think they could live in like this

889
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
The society we live in

890
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
And be like

891
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,583
Like they're victims of a centuries-long Khan

892
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
Basically

893
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
Some of it comes from the fact that in the early times like in the late 1700s and early 1800s

894
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,847
The United States did

895
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
Coin

896
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,663
That was made out of actual gold

897
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
The gold

898
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,343
Being printed and made into

899
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,647
DuQuoin

900
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
In the same way that nickels and dimes were

901
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:26,399
That on some level off a little

902
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,215
Block of gold or whatever you have like a brick

903
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,263
And you just

904
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:37,151
Bitcoin ATM

905
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
Around some places now

906
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
So that allows you to like

907
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
Exchange Bitcoin for cash

908
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
You're still getting cash

909
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Yo it's still

910
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,927
Only a secondary way for you to get

911
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
I'll talk now

912
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
Not physical

913
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:58,655
Arthur our friends far out big shout-out to far out he has a little

914
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
Someone gave her a bit

915
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,519
Someone gave it to me like a long time ago nice worth a bit

916
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
So it's not

917
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,127
He's not a millionaire

918
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:13,759
Kind of pissed off that I didn't buy when it was like $0.35 and hold on to it now

919
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
Get out five months ago it was

920
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,111
Almost 20 grand

921
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,463
Great I think there were

922
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
Dropped 50%

923
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,303
I would have to assume there's a lot of people

924
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
I was going to buy some BB stock

925
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
What it was

926
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:39,871
Should I look at it look it up but check on that

927
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Be higher now

928
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
Do you think the

929
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
Do Saudi Arabia show help their stock

930
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
Possibly

931
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
3.8

932
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
7

933
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343

Spike Lee tried to get involved

975
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519

978
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
When they decided

979
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,407
To go back to the USA Network

980
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,711

I respect the hell out of it

987
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
Seems like a long-standing relationship

988
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Well they help each other

989
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Because they bring in

990
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Big ratings

991
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063

996
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743

That's it

1054
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,503
I think

00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783

1062
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
The late 90s as one might have been to borrow that joke at that end of the 2011-12

1063
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
I'll tell you that

Would they would do one of those

1075
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
They would make it real

1076
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
Weird you're like all this

1077
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
You just

1078
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
It happened

1079
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,199
I'm in the whole plot

1080
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,223
The like

1081
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Creating a band

1082
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,343
And how pointless the people in the band of disposable they are in a cow

1083
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,671
Abusive the music industry is to the people inside it

1084
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,607
No not a chance

1085
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Anyway

1086
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
We're a bit off track and I don't remember

00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
USA Network

1096
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:56,863
Is that they made gold and silver coins

1097
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:05,567
This is one of those things

1098
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
Oh man

1099
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
So

Did you hear his

00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,279
A story about that or anything no but I saw it

1107
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,327
About it and I felt so

1108
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
I felt sympathetic

1109
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:35,519
Yeah I don't know I lost track of Kevin Smith and I would say five years probably

1110

His career fascinates me and

1121
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
How he sort of

1122
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
Figured it out or whatever but anyway

1123
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,615
He was

1124
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
I was to do his part

1125
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
About his

1126
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Heart attack

1127
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
And

1128
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
When he was on the

1129
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Cooperating

1130
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
Table

1131
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,599
Condor

1132
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
He was thinking

1133
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
I thought about you

1134
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,023
Wow

1135
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
You have to save my life

1136
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
The doctor just got

1137
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,679
I'll see what I can do

1138
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,215
Whatever

1139
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
Can make it

1140
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,335
Operational song

1141
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
Some people have lamented the n

1142
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
Yeah

1143
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,319
34 years of age and you're like

1144
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,695
I can't talk about that tween drama and more this. This the show

1145
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
Degrassi going on

1146
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,351
Oh yeah that works original

1147
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
I believe I think

1148
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,655
The Ennis people watched

1149
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,287
I'm sure it's good I'm sure I'm sure it's a positive thing for

1150
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,359
But I just

1151
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:20,223
I can only talk about it for about 2:00 or so and then

1152
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
Then I got to check out

1153
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
Giving pages

1154
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,807
Rapper that guy

1155
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:29,439
I just saw the graduations Lauren Collins

1156
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
Good job Lawrence

1157
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:37,119
The weirdest things happen in my life

1158
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,143
To get him on the Pike

1159
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,215
New wrestlers wrestlers are child actors

1160
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
From Canada

1161
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:48,383
But I've also been very public about that I don't want it

1162
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,199
The idea of him showing up

1163
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
We say don't

1164
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,343
But hey at 7 so they were talking about you on this

1165
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
Joked around about what it would be like if

1166
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
If you dated this

1167
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Don't do that

1168
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
We want that world

1169
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,447
He wouldn't tell me that for sure I know that

1170
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:18,847
Yeah I know that unless he wants to impress me or something

1171
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Man

1172
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
I don't know

1173
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
Is Billy Corgan

1174
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
He

1175
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,159
He seems like he loves Alex you know

1176
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,487
It really does you been on a lot really does

1177
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
And I think he can really

1178
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,607
Alex the smart is a very smart

1179
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
Celebrity interviewer

1180
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
Really pump

1181
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
He make Billy

1182
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,287
97

1183
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
I feel like it's a

1184
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
The king

1185
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,431
So lucky to have you here

1186
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,455
Although

1187
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,223
But that's

1188
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,503
Recall strfkr

1189
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,319
Sure that's called being like

1190
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
Manipulative

1191
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:06,207
He does that with just about any dangle that cared about being with the wizard

1192
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
Person sexually and

1193
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
Front of him

1194
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Did you get into that

1195
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,119
He won't he

1196
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
This is when he writes a book

1197
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,031
It was a lizard person

1198
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,591
He told Rogan that

1199
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
I have

1200
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
People I've got to watch

1201
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:30,527
I will say this cuz I like to make

1202
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:35,391
And a lot of s*** talk

1203
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
When he talks about the music industry

1204
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Fascinating

1205
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,303
He's clearly

1206
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
A bit of a wounded

1207
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
He's got up

1208
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:45,887
It's like yeah

1209
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:52,543
He feels I think he wanted to be the guy and because of the time that he came out he was never the guy that guy because

1210
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
You just happen to be the same

1211
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,591
In class with a lot of

1212
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
Nirvana

1213
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
With very Poppy

1214
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
But like

1215
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
If pimping was super bitter

1216
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,295
Sure I would like getting cuz you eat

1217
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,855
Be Jordan yeah you can't and then I think

1218
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:10,975
He still won't quite let go that like it's cool it was cool to be Pippen

1219
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,767
He still can't quite

1220
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
You know like

1221
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,583
He still like there is ways where he

1222
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Michael stay like

1223
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
You know how we did

1224
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Can we put up with

1225
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,935
Double H nobody

1226
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Like it's interesting

1227
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,079
He clearly has like forever come out

1228
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:29,919
Cuz there was a double album

1229
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
They're hiding there.

1230
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Is that like

1231
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,247
And in both cases

1232
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,855
Could have been a single album

1233
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,927
There's that there's that thing I think Alex

1234
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
Kind of brings them back

1235
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,255
Being worshipped

1236
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,351
Well I mean a billion very interest

1237
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
Thoughts about the

1238
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
Celebrity

1239
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
I think everybody has something to

1240
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,287
Iuka

1241
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,639
Talk to you and like if you talk to them long enough they probably have some interesting insight into

1242
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,223
One thing

1243
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,319
I don't know how to jump back into this

1244
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,855
We got we got it okay

1245
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,463
What's the next topic

1246
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,047
Talking about how it's like we should

1247
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:22,911
Get more into gold bring back the gold standard

1248
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,495
I don't know I don't know if this is what we're talking about but I'm just going to talk about

1249
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Weekly reading

1250
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
We got in this cuz I

1251
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
These guys are all like

1252
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,407
Oh yeah yeah

1253
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,759
I've been conned what it was

1254
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:42,879
Found it

1255
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,415
Who's 5 years ago

1256
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,231
Okay

1257
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,351
The problem with making coins out of real precious metal

1258
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
Is that

1259
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,447
The price and the value of those Metals fluctuate wildly

1260
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,287
Last year's dime

1261
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,335
It has x amount of silver in it

1262
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:08,735
Bond value of silver goes up or down in the next year you have to make dimes that adjust to the silver content

1263
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:14,879
Are you either make them with less rights over or more silver in them in order to keep the price consistent

1264
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,671
Or value of that dime

1265
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Or

1266
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719
You have to just

1267
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,559
Assume that last year is Diamond worth more than a dime

1268
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:26,911
Just assume that doesn't really have a value attached

1269
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,935
Also want these

1270
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
It's kind of more

1271
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,751
Porter porter

1272
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
Gold people be like

1273
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
Michael

1274
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,711
That wasn't so much of a problem back then and I'll explain why

1275
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
That is going to come into a little bit

1276
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,063
A further problem

1277
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,367
Is exemplified by what happened in the late

1278
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,463
1820 huge silver veins were found in Western United States

1279
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
What happened

1280
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
Situation like that is

1281
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,583
Live silver goes up massively

1282
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
And the price goes down drastically

1283
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,935
The only way to avert these sorts of events

1284
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,495
Wikipedia artificially manipulate the public

1285
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:08,383
Perception of the silver Supply which at its core is exactly what the Federal Reserve does

1286
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,687
With restricting or

1287
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:15,295
Expanding the money supply in terms of dollars in order to justify and rationalize

1288
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Otherwise

1289
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,879
All your money is going to become valueless if

1290
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,415
Some random occurrence happy

1291
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,695
Especially with pressure

1292
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
Precious metals

1293
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:31,679
One of the reasons of really rich people love the system that was in place with the the golden silver stand

1294
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,727
We had waited bimetallic standard

1295
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,775
For a long time

1296
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,335
The reason I loved it was because things

1297
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
Like the bland-allison ACT

1298
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,175
Which was passed in 1878

1299
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:46,015
I require the government to buy between two and four million dollars

1300
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
In silver at Market

1301
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,599
Good prices from them in order to make coins

1302
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
Literally

1303
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,951
A government subsidy of

1304
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
People who

1305
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,839
On the lot of gold and silver automatic every year

1306
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,631
In order to subsidize their businesses

1307
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
So

1308
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,495
For that is one of the big reasons that really rich

1309
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,031
People pushed for

1310
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,567
Keeping those systems in place

1311
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Does it matter

1312
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,151
F****** ton of money off this scam on it

1313
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:18,783
And that continues to this day in Summit to some extent or these that mentality not the

1314
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,855
They need to buy all this to make coin in Warsaw got like nickel

1315
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
And now

1316
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
Useless Metals in our coins

1317
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,999
FDR

1318
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,791
Is largely credited in blamed

1319
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,071
Trending the gold standard

1320
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,607
But in reality was Richard

1321
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,423
Who ended the convertibility of gold to cash

1322
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,727
1971

1323
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,775
For that there was still

1324
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
Not necessarily

1325
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,895
Strict Ian of gold $2 or anything like that

1326
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
It had been

1327
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,991
Diffused by FDR

1328
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,295
But if anyone wants pointing finger at anybody

1329
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,575
About gold stuff

1330
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
She probably wanted

1331
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,207
Yeah there's a lot

1332
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
Disease that you suck

1333
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
That was meant for

1334
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,375
Okay

1335
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,703
I feel like anytime breaking this information out and they

1336
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,031
It ruins our flow

1337
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,175
It ruins the fluidity of just rambling about others have Smith

1338
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Billy Corgan

1339
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,015
Degrassi theme song Josie and the Pussycats

1340
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,599
Well let's jump

1341
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,623
You want to talk more

1342
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Okay

1343
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,183
That is the problem

1344
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:52,735
Dollar coin

1345
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
And then

1346
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:05,023
Handle

1347
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
History demonizes

1348
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
The idea of computer currency

1349
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:21,407
I'm fascinated cuz in that Cliff Cain is totally right and totally wrong at the same time about what

1350
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,687
What happened with Bitcoin

1351
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,223
Cuz since 2013

1352
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:30,623
You saw that like train leaving the station baby

1353
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:37,023
20 people

1354
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:43,423
Worried about $9,000 a coin

1355
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,775
It's exactly what happened but it wasn't because people demonized it over there some sort of

1356
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
Nefarious conspiracy against

1357
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
It's just

1358
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
It's an honor

1359
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
Stable

1360
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
With a guy

1361
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Like cane

1362
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
What sort of rude

1363
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
Await him

1364
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,135
To the office

1365
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
Charge

1366
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:10,047
You're talking about him being for the governor

1367
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,631
Apparently

1368
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,751
Right for the Republican nomination at 4,000

1369
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
And he got like 30

1370
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
So he's going to cry

1371
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
Okay

1372
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,967
Well but maybe the Democratic primary wasn't all that interesting Maybe

1373
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,735
I don't know

1374
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
I think it's a wedding

1375
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,063
And once he's won

1376
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:37,951
But do you still only 117 okay

1377
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
They got they got

1378
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
Way more votes

1379
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:46,143
But there's still a chance

1380
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,727
Vote is such a slim margin is jaundice

1381
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,311
You've got to look at it

1382
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
There's some

1383
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,359
Number of votes

1384
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
That like

1385
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
Still haven't

1386
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
Yeah we'll see

1387
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,551
But I mean

1388
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,367
It'll be answering to see like

1389
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
What is hair

1390
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,487
Play me Ventura talks about like when he became

1391
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
Jesse for the people

1392
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:15,839
Watching

1393
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:21,727
He talks about some of the rude awakening is that he had

1394
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:27,871
I think a lot of it does comes on Alex

1395
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
The show

1396
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,943
There's so many times that Alex wants

1397
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
What's the talk about like

1398
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,295
Real bizarre libertarian ideas and like

1399
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,951
Closing the border and stuff like in Japanese

1400
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,279
I've been in the State House

1401
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:50,655
Lake in the kitchen

1402
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,679
Likes

1403
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
Taxes in

1404
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,007
You understand I was in there

1405
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,799
Call that

1406
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,871
I think I'd give Kane word to get in have

1407
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,639
Fake

1408
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
Government employees

1409
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Giving Alex

1410
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,223
Barely.

1411
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:07,039
I don't know what the responsibilities of mayor has

1412
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:10,111
In terms of like big-picture stuff

1413
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,415
He might not have a come-to-jesus moment

1414
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,463
Yeah he might have a come to

1415
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,815
Like

1416
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Yeah yeah

1417
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,119
Do you mind

1418
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,679
Realize how difficult it is to cooperate

1419
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,959
You can't

1420
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
You can't have these

1421
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
Hardline

1422
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,823
Libertarian believe right

1423
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
That would've been a fun character

1424
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
Parks and Rec

1425
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,663
Leica the libertarian

1426
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:37,503
Kind of like Ron Swanson was but like or less

1427
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Bike

1428
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,087
Give this a try and then

1429
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
So

1430
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
This is the reason why

1431
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,255
Like getting along wouldn't work

1432
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,303
Going to read you another thing from the

1433
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,839
Von mises Institute

1434
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
Institute

1435
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,167
Alex has the name wrong

1436
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,007
Can make me have a name wrong a bunch this is about blackmail

1437
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,823
What exactly is blackmail

1438
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:08,735
Is he offering to trade something usually silence for some other good usually money

1439
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:14,623
If the offer of the trade is accepted the blackmailer maintains his silence in the blackmailed pays the agreed-upon price

1440
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:19,487
If a black male offer is rejected the blackmailer May exercise his right to free speech

1441
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,767
And publicize the secret

1442
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
There's nothing amiss here

1443
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,631
All that is happening is that an offer to maintain silence is being made

1444
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:30,239
If the offer is rejected the blackmailer doesn't know more than exercise his right of free speech

1445
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,103
They're fine with blackmail the mugger is offering a possibility

1446
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,151
To keep your life if you give them money

1447
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:42,271
Yeah buddy you could make more up later down the road if you decide not to give the mugger money

1448
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:48,927
That's your choice but you can also get murdered possibly

1449
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
Also threatening

1450
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,143
Emotional violence

1451
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,447
And also hate guess what

1452
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:06,847
Bunch of blackmail is based on this makes me want to Blackmail.

1453
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,735
Based on information that you got

1454
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,503
F***** up memes

1455
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
Somebody yeah

1456
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,623
There's legal ways that you can get

1457
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,159
Information about people

1458
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,487
And then use it to Blackmail our blackmailer

1459
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,047
Probably usually come across that

1460
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,839
Information in Sumner

1461
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,655
Nefarious means we just heard

1462
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Kevin Knox

1463
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Kevin Hart

1464
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
ShopRunner s******

1465
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Just found out it was

1466
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,567
That's crazy

1467
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
That's crazy

1468
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
But I mean

1469
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
He has the right

1470
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
And if he

1471
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
Chooses

1472
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
That that

1473
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,087
See this is what I want to get to release

1474
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
Specifically

1475
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,903
Is that Libertarians like

1476
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
Trot around

1477
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,999
15 is even going to say as much

1478
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
It just say like you know what

1479
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,839
How can anybody disagree with us

1480
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,703
Sure all we really want is the most freedom for everybody and I remember

1481
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Hearing about this

1482
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,239
College

1483
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
Like what's a libertarian

1484
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,567
Do whatever you want

1485
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,151
Just don't bother me man

1486
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,223
Yes it's down to hippy-dippy in like kind of cool Wonder

1487
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,271
Yeah it's great except

1488
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,599
Problem is when you really get down to what the beliefs are with

1489
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,135
A lot of libertarian

1490
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,951
I want to paint with a broad brush there's

1491
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,279
There's different it's not a homogeneous group or anyting

1492
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,071
A large

1493
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,631
Large portion of the libertarian Community is

1494
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,935
Super f***** up oh yeah it's very sexy

1495
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
To those people

1496
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,775
Yeah that's like oh what yeah I'm not Democratic Republic

1497
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,055
I'm at Liberty

1498
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:45,663
And a lot of it comes down to making bizarre rationalization

1499
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,455
To retain your wealth

1500
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,807
And baked bizarre arguments as to why you can be a people

1501
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
Like

1502
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Hey

1503
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,927
I'll give you an argument why you shouldn't blackmail people

1504
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
F****** dick move

1505
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,375
So he remarried one more real quick just to really bring this f****** home

1506
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,935
Here is one of their beliefs about parents

1507
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
Quotes

1508
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,543
A parent does not have the right to aggress against

1509
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
His children

1510
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,639
But also did not have a legal obligation to

1511
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,943
To feed close or educate his children

1512
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,527
Such as such obligations would entail positive X

1513
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:26,111
Coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights

1514
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,695
The parent therefore may not murder or mutilate his child

1515
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,511
And the Outlaws parent from doing so

1516
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:36,607
But the parent should have the legal right not to feed the children

1517
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,655
I eat you allow it to die

1518
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:44,031
Therefore may not properly compel the parent to feed a child to keep it alive

1519
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,615
This rule allows us to solve such a vexing questions as

1520
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,943
Should a parent have the right to allow a deformed baby to die

1521
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
EG by not feeding it

1522
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
The answer of course is yes

1523
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,391
Following from the larger right to allow any baby weather deformed or not to die

1524
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,207
Though as we shall see below

1525
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:08,351
In a Libertarian Society the existence of a free baby Market will bring such neglect down to a minimum

1526
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,703
You want to buy

1527
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:19,871
I have a baby I don't want it you want a baby you have money I want that

1528
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,639
What's the problem

1529
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:27,295
Why are you getting in the way of Commerce I feel like Libertarians

1530
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:34,207
It's burdening you with a responsibility with your child

1531
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,231
I feel like libertarian

1532
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
Are kind of like

1533
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Sociopath

1534
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,583
Guess who just want to get rich

1535
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,631
And it's like or orbit

1536
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Comfortable

1537
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,191
It's like they have no heart

1538
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,983
So it's just like the guy don't

1539
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,263
Mcscrooges wrong at all

1540
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
Clothing

1541
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
By Mike it yet

1542
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,151
I should not have a

1543
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:57,759
Constable for this thing

1544
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
People being good

1545
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Partners in a row

1546
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:04,159
I can't even imagine

1547
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,439
I think so often

1548
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,463
Is that like

1549
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,327
It is being a monster sociopath

1550
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
Time will

1551
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
You constantly

1552
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,655
We hear from these assholes

1553
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,239
Is it like even in the blackmailing example later in that article

1554
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,847
Is there a moral responsibility

1555
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,407
Who cares

1556
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:32,831
That is

1557
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,391
Why would you recognize

1558
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,927
Senior defensive

1559
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,463
Not speeding kids

1560
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,559
Probably deeply immoral

1561
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,839
Special like that

1562
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
For the

1563
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,399
Scrooge example

1564
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
For the

1565
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,959
Black male cats

1566
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:56,127
Why are those your example Libertarians also or contrarian by Nature

1567
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,663
Are the positions will see them take

1568
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
AirG

1569
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,991
Intentionally

1570
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,647
You know how to read Michael does comedy ta reverse Engineers yeah yeah

1571
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
Politics

1572
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,351
Libertarians like to say the n-word on stage

1573
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Bright jokes

1574
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,959
For those are whatever I think it's a lot of stuff where

1575
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
Yeah I can

1576
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,775
I think it's a little that the shock in the

1577
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Contrarian

1578
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,871
I don't like that will guess what I'm going to show you why it is

1579
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,639
Okay

1580
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,407
Blackmail peep

1581
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
It's pretty remarkable in comedy

1582
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,319
Because all you're trying to do is make people laugh

1583
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,671
Is it weird

1584
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
Like

1585
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:44,255
They also driving should be

1586
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,351
It should just be illegal because hey Manuel.

1587
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,935
Navigation

1588
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,727
Be at the argument is that like

1589
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,775
Being drunk isn't

1590
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
The crime

1591
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:00,127
The crime is that you killed someone o-okay

1592
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:00,895
Yeah course

1593
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,175
Say that

1594
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,991
If you get home without hurting anybody

1595
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,807
Rape that already works

1596
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
You know

1597
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:12,159
Even with it being illegal you're never going to get pulled over in Lazada

1598
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:18,815
You know you have your car or you don't swerve

1599
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
People are like I'm not paying taxes and here's why

1600
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,703
It's kind of like I'm very drunk and here's why

1601
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
All those are the same

1602
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
Sure

1603
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,775
Crazy cabbie

1604
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,799
The Howard Stern Show

1605
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,615
Yeah he's probably a libertarian

1606
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:38,015
Yeah it's wild man I do respect on some level

1607
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:41,087
Great marketing

1608
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,111
Feeling on

1609
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:47,743
Back the layers though and I think we're going to do a much longer

1610
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:53,375
Josie the Pussycats

1611
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,447
So much of it really boils down to like

1612
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,007
Trying to make rationalization

1613
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,543
Four states to secede from the Union

1614
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,359
Sure it comes down to like trying to break up the United

1615
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:07,455
States on some level

1616
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
These guys is like

1617
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
Show me your

1618
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,807
Through a day

1619
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:12,831
In the life

1620
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,367
Your perfect Society

1621
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
I mean like

1622
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:22,559
I don't know what it would property

1623
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:28,703
That's my god-given right is my kind of my property

1624
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:35,103
Came over a little bit later in the day or pissed off that I killed him and buried him in a shallow grave

1625
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:40,735
Okay well you're what are you going to do about it what's the recourse for weak vocal cord

1626
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:45,855
Deep alliances with that local Court

1627
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,647
They found in my favor and then

1628
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,231
They have their own Court

1629
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Absolutely not

1630
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,655
I have a lot of money in your spine

1631
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:04,543
I ended up giving me $5 until the be on your way

1632
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,407
Not redeemable any anywhere else

1633
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:14,271
But if you give them to me I will give you gold I don't know I don't know probably not

1634
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,575
It's a very bizarre

1635
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
If you want to buy any

1636
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,719
You can I sold six kids already

1637
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,535
Yeah my wife is pissed

1638
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:30,655
I've even yet even though Utopia version of like this like this

1639
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:36,031
This presumption that sounds good like more freedom for everybody

1640
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,079
That presumption even

1641
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:42,431
Taken to like what their version of more freedom is

1642
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:47,551
It just says away their sucks and even when you get there it sucks

1643
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,343
I don't want to live alone

1644
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
And a mountain

1645
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:56,511
They don't it comes down to an idea largely

1646
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,559
Christian reconstruction

1647
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,887
I want to recreate the United States

1648
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,911
As a Christian Nation

1649
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,703
Yeah where they don't have to

1650
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,983
You deal with gain

1651
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,335
They don't want to have to deal with black people they don't want that is there a gay libertarian

1652
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
Party

1653
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
It's not a party

1654
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:18,015
Party I want to go talk to them as right now it's a party

1655
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,415
I don't think I don't think there's a strong gay libertarian faction

1656
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,463
The log cabin republican Republic

1657
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
Yeah there's a

1658
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,511
Navigate Republic

1659
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,071
That's a great to another song

1660
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,863
Alma de Republic

1661
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:40,799
They was talking about like slavery is a choice

1662
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,567
Republican

1663
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,871
Jared what Nas black Republican

1664
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,151
I have not now

1665
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,015
It wasn't on Illmatic and I'm not listening

1666
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
Also he's have a new album coming out

1667
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Kanye West which might be

1668
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
Be part of

1669
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,927
Kanye West in media blitz

1670
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
I didn't

1671
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
It's awesome tweets about it

1672
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
The show is that

1673
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:10,239
I'm largely emotionally checked out of all of this stuff that's going on because I'm already convinced the Kanye

1674
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,263
Trolling everybody

1675
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
Yeah basically

1676
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,128
He's doing the outside of a large-scale think

1677
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,408
Peace in some way

1678
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,968
Yappy unfortunate consequence of it is that

1679
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:26,624
We live in right now is way too dangerous stuff like that like

1680
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,464
Stunt stand

1681
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,256
It was okay

1682
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
Now you can't

1683
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,328
Can try to stand

1684
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,120
Create more stands

1685
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
I would argue

1686
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,448
Find write the song

1687
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,984
Not fine

1688
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
2

1689
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:47,616
Stir the pot like that and I'm not sure if that's what he's doing cuz there's a decent chance

1690
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,920
Is wrong

1691
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,200
Talking with everybody

1692
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,992
You have

1693
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,272
Militant

1694
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
Angry

1695
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,136
White nationalist forces at play

1696
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,672
And

1697
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
You

1698
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,512
Phora

1699
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,352
Pretend to be on their side

1700
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,120
Yeah

1701
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,400
It really

1702
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,192
It really can cause

1703
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,264
A real problem

1704
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,336
The ripples to it that are not like

1705
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,152
You can't account for

1706
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:24,736
The light in the same way you put a little better

1707
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,064
Silver in a dime today and who knows what it's worth tomorrow

1708
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,600
You retweet

1709
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,184
Conservative propagandists

1710
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
Yeah and say like

1711
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,512
This is great stuff

1712
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,584
Are Carnival row

1713
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,376
Affected

1714
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:45,984
Very f***** up and that's why there's an outside chance

1715
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,264
That he would go on

1716
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,032
Infowars

1717
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,616
But I don't think you would understand

1718
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
An elaborate

1719
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,688
Infowars

1720
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,968
Perfect perfect

1721
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,808
But I don't I don't think you understand what the ramifications that way

1722
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:04,416
But yeah I really don't I don't think that most people

1723
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:08,000
Who know about Alex understand

1724
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,792
What he's really about

1725
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,608
Butcher

1726
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
Jones

1727
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
Infowar

1728
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Guy

1729
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,728
Oh no

1730
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,568
Benefit a lot of return business

1731
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,384
Infowars

1732
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
But you're just like put me on every show I went to Market

1733
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,712
Get my book or whatever.

1734
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
Perfect

1735
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,320
Spoiler alert I don't think King never came back

1736
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:36,160
Caden come around this time of year I think he might have gotten the message

1737
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,464
That

1738
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
I was like

1739
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
How to talk to your pal

1740
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,608
The bad for business

1741
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,144
This is not what's best for business

1742
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,984
So at this point the show we get into a course

1743
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
Every libertarian

1744
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,824
And the Alex and Kane are no

1745
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,640
Gan-gan

1746
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:36,576
First of all I would argue that you take the sports stadiums out of there any Transportation safety administration

1747
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:41,696
Creation has a reason to be on Road

1748
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:45,536
But the other thing that he's staying there the end there Alex

1749
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,168
It's like when the reality is we got to have guns and everyone in order to

1750
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
Be safe

1751
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:58,848
Professor John Donahue

1752
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,872
Right to carry laws

1753
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,432
Show an increase of 13 to 15%

1754
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
In violent crime rates

1755
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,504
In the Ten Years After

1756
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,040
The inaction of those laws

1757
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,832
The quote.

1758
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:15,488
There is not even the slightest hint in the data that the right to carry laws reduce overall violent

1759
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,256
Crime

1760
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:20,608
Also in 2013 and study by the National Crime victimization survey

1761
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:24,192
Found that 99.2% of violent attacks

1762
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,472
In the United States

1763
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,032
No gun is used in self-defense

1764
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,848
It's like no one another person

1765
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,176
.8% of violent attacks

1766
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,224
In any way involved the defensive

1767
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
Gone

1768
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,808
13 to 15% increase

1769
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,880
In violent crime in places where people are allowed to carry guns

1770
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,904
With right

1771
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,928
Scary alarm

1772
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:50,560
You start to see a picture where no everyone having guns is more f****** dangerous yet

1773
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,864
Did John Donahue the guy who wrote that study

1774
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,912
Get a really good analogy that he made

1775
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
That's like

1776
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:59,264
Allowing everyone to have guns is sort of similar to

1777
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,128
Do you saying I want to get a brain scan every week to make sure that my brain is healthy

1778
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,992
And like well yes you will detect whatever tumor might be there

1779
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,528
We're going to get radiation

1780
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,296
Can poisoning

1781
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,832
From that so it's

1782
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,136
It's that same sort of thing it's like

1783
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,952
Not taking into account all of the factors that are there

1784
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,536
It is imagine the scenario where

1785
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
He's getting

1786
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,608
Gift mug filled out a gun

1787
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,656
If you go on Alex's website you got info

1788
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
Bright

1789
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Scroll down a little

1790
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
It's always going to be

1791
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,008
Story of

1792
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,032
The guy

1793
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
You know it was at the

1794
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Convenience store

1795
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,872
Getting rods he pulled out his gun

1796
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,408
It's always

1797
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,432
They celebrate

1798
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:42,272
Tell stories they love those are 8 years

1799
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:46,112
Sure tell em that it's that way it's either the

1800
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,392
Hades record

1801
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,416
Gigi's gangraped

1802
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
This woman

1803
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,464
In front of her family

1804
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:54,304
The hay this hero was at a McDonald's that was

1805
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
Been held up Anita

1806
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
Texas gun out in

1807
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,632
And took out the the robber

1808
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:04,032
Waffle House

1809
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,568
False flag

1810
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:09,664
Also not talking about that fundraiser and gave all the victims

1811
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:16,576
Also not talking about how the guys who got arrested at Starbucks agreed to a $1 settlement from the

1812
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:20,672
They'll be more money for small business

1813
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:27,072
How to pronounce complete bulshit all of the things that you seem to believe in by everybody else

1814
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:31,936
Which all you have is your bigotry which you shall have you showed a couple episodes back

1815
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
That

1816
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,240
He was for the

1817
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
People getting

1818
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,360
He what he was be with Aunt doing it for the Vicky was it at Port of the victim

1819
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,384
I was just like

1820
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Oh Alex

1821
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,200
Yeah

1822
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:49,856
Add some of the right side of history and we were a little too far I think

1823
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,744
Shotguns

1824
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,328
Guns are great around on the eclipse

1825
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:05,216
Prim8 where it is much as he agrees with Alex's statements

1826
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,264
On his own accord about guns

1827
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,032
At all

1828
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:11,872
Airport

1829
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,640
Every week

1830
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
Of his life

1831
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:17,760
Together combine

1832
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
But

1833
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,184
Where is that club

1834
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,488
It's got to be somewhere

1835
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
You realize how many flights

1836
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,376
Buttermere baby drives a bit too

1837
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,472
Coachella pretty close to each other but they fly

1838
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,752
Places then drive to the

1839
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,520
The shows

1840
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,312
That is not a flight every we going to play Never

1841
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,592
Yeah probably

1842
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,456
Not like came out

1843
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
20 years

1844
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:52,832
Yeah that's true

1845
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:59,232
That's true he talks about the IRA I didn't include this clip cuz volume answering but all you really says is like the idea

1846
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,048
Of the TSA at the airport to the violation

1847
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,072
The 4th amendment

1848
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:05,120
Unreasonable

1849
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,400
What they

1850
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:11,264
I'm just trying to get on a plane why do I have to be searched by

1851
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,056
I agree to Annex

1852
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:16,128
But I disagree with what they would think

1853
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,408
Is the

1854
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
What's reasonable

1855
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,480
Reasonable search

1856
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,760
I do think

1857
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:24,320
We live in now

1858
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:28,416
And the fact that everyone safety is contingent on each other

1859
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,976
I do think that a business

1860
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,792
And the government does have a responsibility to make sure

1861
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
You're not bringing

1862
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:39,936
The f****** weapon onto a plane everyone's a Sitting Duck Oregon

1863
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,728
Bad for like fruit

1864
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,008
From another place that'll get

1865
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,944
Sure or could introduce the new virus into the ecosystem

1866
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,480
Legitimate

1867
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:57,088
That is a reasonable chair that's not a violation for Amendment

1868
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,184
It's weird we have to take our shoes off

1869
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:01,952
Yamin

1870
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,744
I'm in on that level

1871
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
But

1872
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,840
I don't know they just want nothing they weren't just want like

1873
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
I know

1874
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:13,728
I should be able to smoke on planes I should be able to

1875
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,008
Exactly

1876
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
Brandishing

1877
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,848
I just put it on the

1878
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,896
Table the table

1879
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:28,832
And their argument would be like of course I would never do that it should just be allowed to do that every

1880
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,856
He was going to behave

1881
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
Right

1882
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,672
Lots of people aren't f******

1883
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,488
Batshit crazy yeah we know a lot of people

1884
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,256
People that are batshit

1885
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,816
That's going to it's like

1886
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
These people that live in the

1887
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
Sort of

1888
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
I don't

1889
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,728
Where

1890
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
Like that

1891
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,288
Down the road

1892
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,312
Like that it's like

1893
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
Boston

1894
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,128
You really think everybody

1895
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,408
Olive Garden not needed

1896
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
Some type of background

1897
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,296
Mentally ill people

1898
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:02,368
Here in Chicago vary

1899
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
I'd like a half hour trip

1900
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,976
The entire time very normal-looking

1901
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,536
Permit 50-ish looking guy

1902
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:12,608
Was just muttering to himself but I was going to kill some people

1903
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,400
Yeah

1904
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
Didn't phase me

1905
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
Just staring

1906
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,544
Everyone

1907
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,616
And that you

1908
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
You disappointed

1909
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,408
Well

1910
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,224
It's not my problem you know I hate to say it

1911
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,904
I will I will step up if that's it for now

1912
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:39,488
I can't protect you from look

1913
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,304
Disgaea flexes then we'll do that

1914
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,328
Too much risk

1915
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,400
Cuz he might have gone on the bus

1916
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
Mega bosses in

1917
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,080
Greyhound

1918
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:58,176
They're reasonably more dangerous because there aren't those

1919
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,968
There aren't as though

1920
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,504
Real of security

1921
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
Absolutely

1922
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,600
A couple years back on a Greyhound bus and

1923
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:12,000
Help people sell drugs on Megabus

1924
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,048
Because that says who the Wild West

1925
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,632
So

1926
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,656
Change

1927
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,216
There's a lot of discussion about like

1928
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,288
Alex wants them to say that we're at a Tipping Point

1929
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,592
Yeah I've got Obama's in office again

1930
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,408
Yeah the re-election

1931
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,432
They just

1932
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,712
Rambo about

1933
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,992
Federal Reserve

1934
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:36,320
To the point where like they're not even

1935
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:40,416
But yeah they just they say like you know what we're probably at a Tipping Point

1936
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:45,024
I thought 2007/2008 was going to be a Tipping Point

1937
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,376
Maybe we'll become the wine bar Republican six months maybe we never will

1938
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,680
You are not saying anything

1939
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,216
It's absolutely not

1940
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,008
Obama to do all the

1941
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:55,776
Cephalic

1942
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,056
He was going to do

1943
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:01,408
Yeah I didn't do all the stuff that you were programmed to be afraid he was going to do

1944
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,016
Electrical

1945
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,552
Yeah maybe

1946
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Because of you I mean

1947
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
I like to think

1948
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,000
What was that

1949
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
Lit up

1950
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:21,376
That was the White House Correspondents Dinner started at all

1951
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,824
Batman but I do wonder if cuz I know that Rodger

1952
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,176
Yeah but that would have been

1953
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,480
4 years

1954
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,784
Earlier

1955
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,832
Real talk

1956
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,856
Root beer talk

1957
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,440
That could have started race riot

1958
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,024
I mean the shed he would have said about his nicknames for

1959
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,304
Jet for Obama

1960
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,840
Duffy unhinged

1961
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,376
Way beats

1962
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,424
Obama bopping down the

1963
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Mystere zverev

1964
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,472
Air Force 1

1965
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,008
Thinly veiled racist

1966
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:02,336
I don't think that enough

1967
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,408
2012 I mean the internet wasn't good

1968
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:08,224
But it wasn't as bad as it is now

1969
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:13,088
So I don't know I don't know if you would have had the same

1970
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,112
Matt Stafford

1971
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
Bean bag then

1972
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Black man

1973
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:20,256
I'm saying though I don't

1974
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,024
Yeah

1975
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
You know I think

1976
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,096
Easier for people to wear

1977
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,400
You know Trump that b****

1978
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,936
Versus like yeah

1979
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,032
Except except

1980
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:38,688
But that's a part of the progression of how bad the internet

1981
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,344
Trump

1982
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,160
That if that's what we're talking about all I could have done

1983
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:48,928
Some really good work

1984
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,696
There

1985
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:55,328
I do agree with you that like hating a woman somehow more okay than hitting a blackout

1986
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,888
But I think a woman

1987
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:04,288
I am and it was funny because after the like if you had a black guy in a black woman and you were targeting one of them everyone would be so much

1988
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,312
More thrilled if you target

1989
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
Black women

1990
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:10,176
You sure there was a

1991
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,456
Everyone's kind of like

1992
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
When do that when all the

1993
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,528
Republicans are after the

1994
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Correspondence

1995
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,880
The guys who

1996
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,928
Worthy shirts they showed like a man and a woman

1997
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:21,952
F*** your feeling

1998
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,720
Trump 20

1999
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,792
Shut up and Shapiro

2000
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:26,816
So

2001
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,120
Way more extended Maga hat

2002
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
You know

2003
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,680
Trumpet B shirts

2004
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
The man

2005
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,240
We're both wearing

2006
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,032
Hillary for prison

2007
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,312
That to me used

2008
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,104
Just like a white couple

2009
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
Can go out

2010
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:46,528
And where they're Hillary for

2011
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:52,416
For prison shirts

2012
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,232
Girlfriend's butt

2013
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,304
It's I mean like that girl if he came out

2014
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
And whatever

2015
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,400
Let's go to Chili's

2016
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,728
It came out with like an Obama for prison

2017
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
You got tickets

2018
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:13,920
Because there might be more blowback also but I also think about that

2019
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:14,688
Is like

2020
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,224
I think

2021
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,760
How bad

2022
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:24,160
Culture is just because we have to keep variable similar was running against

2023
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,744
Obama in 2016

2024
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,144
Confirm if the two of them were running against each other in the climate we are right now

2025
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
No but like

2026
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,496
That just by historical coincidence

2027
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,824
Let's say is that George h.w. Bush got his second term

2028
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,872
After I pushed everything forward 4 years

2029
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:47,200
So all of everything except

2030
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:50,784
You're going to have trouble with 911 is Howard Bill Clinton's term

2031
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,904
Comic book series about

2032
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,720
The sake of everything let's just assume everything is the same

2033
01:35:58,976 --> 01:35:59,488
Except Trump

2034
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,280
Obama running in 26

2035
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:04,352
Hillary for prison shirts

2036
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,400
You would see Obama as a monkey

2037
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,192
That's what you would see

2038
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,848
But I know this but yeah I've been to gunshow

2039
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:21,248
Gas station gas station bumper stickers

2040
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,784
Would see about Obama it was

2041
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,368
Unhinged

2042
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,904
Even the most

2043
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,488
Racist sexist homophobic s*******

2044
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,048
It's easier for them to wear the Hillary

2045
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,328
For prison

2046
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,864
Versus the Obama

2047
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,912
Get out whatever sure right

2048
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:45,056
Cuz it's like we're this in a bunch of black

2049
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:51,456
Oh wow but it's your shirt and some people still wear

2050
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,480
Swastikas out

2051
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:58,112
True that's why I'm sure it's those variables we had its way

2052
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,440
Probably legit

2053
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:06,560
Like there'll be way more and act

2054
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,608
Or not one

2055
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,448
We would have had some bad Hombres on

2056
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,472
Sides

2057
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:17,312
Not on both sides sides

2058
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,128
Do you think and I do want to get off at

2059
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,712
I got to be honest

2060
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,504
Penis Superboy

2061
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:31,648
There was a part of me that was like when I was cutting these clip I was concerned because

2062
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:37,792
I know that Kane has been on Infowars That's so exciting format

2063
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,680
Is not allowed

2064
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:49,312
Charismatic for you where are they talk about Kane the character okay we'll get back to

2065
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,616
Whatever you want

2066
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,640
Studio lights

2067
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,456
A little bit

2068
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:01,088
Bills and homeschool

2069
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:05,440
And when I say

2070
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,000
Hold off

2071
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,792
A violent revolution

2072
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,608
We can just restore our Republic

2073
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:15,424
What does

2074
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,496
I think about all this

2075
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:28,480
A lot of laughs there from Alex

2076
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,272
I would have hooked up

2077
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
Jumper cable

2078
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,832
Shane McMahon

2079
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,600
Testicle

2080
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,136
Electrocuted

2081
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:39,744
The character came probably wouldn't be

2082
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:42,560
I mean it came would want Society to have all the

2083
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:44,864
Break break

2084
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:49,728
Cuz he's so big and cousin

2085
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,008
Then what's the point

2086
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,848
You want to World of John Cena's where that you could really be

2087
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
Exactly

2088
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:02,528
View of libertarianism

2089
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,904
They've made a number of arguments for like monarchy

2090
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,184
Good

2091
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,280
But it's got to be like tomorrow

2092
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
If they're just like if you would

2093
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
If there's a heaven

2094
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
Play cool

2095
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,032
Going to be bad at all

2096
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,152
But benevolent

2097
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,176
He loves you

2098
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,416
Do you think we can't get them out of

2099
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,464
People

2100
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:43,744
Do you say

2101
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,560
I don't know

2102
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,096
So Trump would say

2103
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,144
He makes it

2104
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,704
Presidency

2105
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,240
I think I'll make it

2106
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,104
Whatever your question is I would say

2107
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,920
My only real firm conviction

2108
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,712
Is that if he does

2109
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,736
He's going

2110
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,296
Yeah

2111
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,344
What I want

2112
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,136
And I thought I have

2113
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:11,904
I think also he

2114
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:16,768
When that's done

2115
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,304
And

2116
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,328
Do you think

2117
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,120
Will it ever kind of not it's like ask

2118
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
Going to go back to life

2119
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:26,240
Hey are we just on this course this

2120
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,312
Is that there's no going back if we have eight years of

2121
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,336
Trump

2122
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:37,248
We are but I don't I don't like they're all like this negative

2123
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,296
I really dislike

2124
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,368
Sword of Doom and Gloom

2125
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:46,464
I'm guilty of a toothache

2126
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,048
But I really dislike it to an extent so like when I when I say like it

2127
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,864
After eight years if we have eight years of this

2128
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,144
Yeah we're done

2129
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,960
I really do think we're done but it just is

2130
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,008
We have to transition

2131
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,104
Direct culture has to transition and we have to racket

2132
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,640
Naya's is that like

2133
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,688
Politics isn't real

2134
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Anymore

2135
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:09,760
What will end up happening I think

2136
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,784
Is will have

2137
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,880
Another conman become president sure and then we'll holler woman

2138
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,928
Turn off

2139
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,976
We'll have a situation that comes into play

2140
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:23,584
Where do you have like every like stockholders

2141
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,544
Create local support network

2142
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,360
Stuff like that

2143
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
Is people trying to take care of each other and

2144
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,784
Looks like you had the

2145
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,600
The hippies were like

2146
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,368
A reaction

2147
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,392
Into everybody being

2148
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
Straitlaced

2149
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,208
And then everyone

2150
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,488
Amanda

2151
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,512
Protec disco arousal

2152
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,072
Glow in the bathroom

2153
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:59,168
There a Benny's cultures that have come out of

2154
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
Reaction

2155
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
To the previous

2156
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:05,824
Sculptures the ping-pong.

2157
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,872
I can't imagine

2158
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
8 years of trump

2159
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,712
And then some new

2160
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,480
You know

2161
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:18,880
But here's the problem with that historical Theory as we're experiencing it right now

2162
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,160
Already

2163
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,440
That are good examples

2164
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:22,976
So like

2165
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:25,024
With the Kanye situation

2166
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,328
There's a half of the world

2167
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,120
And yes the world is

2168
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:32,960
But you half of the internet that saw that and there was like

2169
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:36,032
Wow that's really f***** up what the said

2170
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,080
That's really really stupid

2171
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:45,248
Whatever was saying that like

2172
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:50,624
There's a 400 years at some point why didn't you get out of it

2173
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,696
Not realizing any of the realities of what

2174
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,720
Slaves existence

2175
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,000
What's lichen

2176
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,280
Brutal murders

2177
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,560
Yeah and I

2178
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:02,144
Even just the displacement aspect of it originally

2179
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,680
Go so far into

2180
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:08,800
Anyway I don't want much better scholars in terms of the reality of slavery I don't want to

2181
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
Get into it

2182
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,432
Do it

2183
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,712
And then the other side

2184
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,760
The trumpet people their response

2185
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
Do it is

2186
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:24,160
Oh my God Kanye getting them off the Democratic Plantation and stuff like that

2187
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
So you have

2188
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,768
Two people there two groups of people experiencing the same thing

2189
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,048
Emporia

2190
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,328
Polar different way

2191
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:34,400
I meant last night as we recording this on Thursday

2192
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:37,728
Last night Rudy Giuliani was on Hannity Show

2193
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,008
And he said

2194
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,800
The Trump repaid

2195
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,360
Michael Cohen for the payment cuz he's f****** bro

2196
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:47,456
Well now in payments because if you paid it all at once it would be a violation

2197
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:50,528
Have to be reported which of the lobsters do

2198
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:56,416
But like

2199
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,976
Probably what Alex told us in 2015

2200
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
But like New Jersey

2201
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
Bleecker Street

2202
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:04,608
These are in the Consortium is on the East Coast

2203
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,448
A lot of the internet heard

2204
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:11,264
That interview I was like holyshit

2205
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,896
He just said that Trump repaid Cohen for the hush money that he gave to a pornstar

2206
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:21,248
In the middle of a campaign

2207
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:24,320
Really is a damning indictment

2208
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,368
This morning they're all high-fiving each other and they

2209
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,672
Zeds Dead wine out to

2210
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,232
But you look at the other side of the internet

2211
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,256
And they were like

2212
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,024
It wasn't

2213
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,048
Champagnefun

2214
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:40,448
Throughout the entire story

2215
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:43,264
And that the Russia probe is b*******

2216
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
Like hey

2217
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,312
Higher choir boy

2218
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
Any page

2219
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,640
I saw that exact

2220
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:55,040
Over and over again we didn't hire Dana Point president

2221
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:58,624
You have these two sides of the internet that are experiencing events

2222
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,904
Wheatley different ways

2223
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,208
And people are galvanized

2224
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,744
Into whatever their camping

2225
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,048
So the ping-pong theory of like

2226
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:11,424
Reacting to EXO I work towards why

2227
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:16,544
Or whatever you have two different groups in different directions

2228
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,592
They're going to react

2229
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,152
To whatever events are coming again

2230
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:23,456
Different rabbit alright

2231
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,016
But then black

2232
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,600
I don't I don't know how

2233
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:32,416
I don't think that's possible

2234
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:36,512
I think the trend that were experiencing leads towards anger on both sides

2235
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,792
This is like sports for

2236
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,072
Yep

2237
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,352
And their team

2238
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
And winning

2239
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,680
You know

2240
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,960
That's why everyone

2241
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:48,288
Keeps bringing up Hillary but it's only the people on the right or bring them

2242
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:55,200
They're like she lost get over it that's what's up but I know ever is like let's get her in

2243
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,736
Annie brought up the Clinton

2244
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
Both of them

2245
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,832
Trump hired Bill Clinton's a lawyer

2246
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
Yeah

2247
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,136
It's I mean it's so funny

2248
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:05,184
It's it's a farce

2249
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
Yeah it works. That really is

2250
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:09,792
I don't

2251
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:15,424
I don't know I don't know the reality like I don't know I don't know what Trump did or didn't do but I'd know that

2252
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:21,056
I don't know that but I do believe that the investigation that's going on isn't a witch

2253
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:29,760
I have a certain amount of faith that if it is a Witch Hunt

2254
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,552
I think people will be able to

2255
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,576
See through it

2256
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,416
If the end result of the investigation is

2257
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,184
Lackluster

2258
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,720
The evidence

2259
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,768
Presented isn't compelling

2260
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:45,120
Then I think we can have another conversation at that point yeah for now

2261
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:45,888
Tumi

2262
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,960
I dunno

2263
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:50,752
What is publicly available

2264
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,056
It looks bad and it's a lot of

2265
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:55,872
But let's not jump to any there's also a lot of

2266
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
Bad dump

2267
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,248
What's the cast

2268
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:06,624
The characters that you buy.

2269
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,672
But I but I think we've

2270
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,440
That

2271
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,976
Some of these guys

2272
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,280
Got roped in with

2273
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,816
The dummy I mean that's like

2274
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,096
Every business

2275
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,376
You'll talk to you all.

2276
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,496
But feeling is way up

2277
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,080
I think there's a lot with cousin there's a lot of those guys

2278
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:26,848
Sure

2279
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,384
Or just like

2280
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:35,040
F****** monsters monster like them

2281
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:40,928
I thought you were going to say

2282
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:43,232
People like no kill kill

2283
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,048
Can get this deal made me like don't worry about it like

2284
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:50,144
Prince

2285
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,680
So it's like all these types of

2286
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,704
You got like

2287
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:53,984
Bad p

2288
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,008
Dump

2289
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,800
People who have just been

2290
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:57,824
You know

2291
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,616
Lucky to be around

2292
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
All sources

2293
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,248
But I think

2294
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,040
If Trump can make

2295
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,320
Get past this though I agree

2296
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:12,160
Yeah I would say

2297
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:12,928
It doesn't matter

2298
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:18,816
Like even if he fires all the people Dorian is way it doesn't

2299
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,632
Either safe or

2300
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:22,656
I'm a

2301
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,032
I'm going to just

2302
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,056
Skip

2303
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,592
A couple more facts in

2304
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:32,128
Alright Degrassi

2305
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,408
We will we will

2306
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:39,808
I will get right back to where we were a second ago but I have I'm just going to run down the rest of the street

2307
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:40,576
Patreon

2308
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,672
We will in a second

2309
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:49,280
I completely forgot cuz I get it I got excited about talk about Rocco

2310
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,840
So

2311
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,144
Alex Alex

2312
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,472
Meant that the American Revolution is the only good Revolution that's ever happened

2313
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:00,032
Which I would argue is not the case for India

2314
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:02,080
Native American

2315
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:05,408
Or black people

2316
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:12,064
Which brings the most freedom and that's not true for many groups who aren't

2317
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,832
White

2318
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:17,184
For a very long time a shockingly long time

2319
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:18,976
Pretty smart

2320
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,256
People in modern-day

2321
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,048
I don't think people realize

2322
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,328
How long

2323
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,352
It took four

2324
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,376
Basic rights

2325
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,704
To be applied maybe you should talk to Ernie Ladd

2326
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:34,336
Ernest Miller

2327
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:35,360
Yeah

2328
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:39,200
Senator Kaine brings up the red pill

2329
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:45,600
I got really excited cuz I was going to make a plan about how he's a big red pill machine

2330
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:52,256
Clippers Rap God

2331
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,560
Kevin naso degrades called The Big Red Pill Poppin

2332
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:00,960
I mean you just talk about it talk about writing for the Daily Caller

2333
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,776
Which is publication that's owned by Taco

2334
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:04,800
Tucker Carlson

2335
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,080
Full of s***

2336
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,664
You're right eroding article about wealth inequality and how the government

2337
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,944
Creates it

2338
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,784
Bunch of bulshit doesn't actually cite any evidence

2339
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,552
The same thing

2340
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:20,160
The Alex and him talked about how bad Health Care is around the world

2341
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:20,928
About how like

2342
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:24,768
Alex has a New England

2343
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:28,096
He doesn't you were going to get that black lipstick

2344
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,912
Obviously pay for himself

2345
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,240
Company

2346
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,008
Would have health in

2347
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,032
Provided by

2348
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:44,224
Talk about how he has an employee is dealing with a terrible British

2349
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,440
I don't care what he say

2350
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:56,512
And then

2351
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:58,816
Canada who needed an MRI

2352
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:03,680
And so he had to wait awhile face on the Canadian system

2353
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:08,800
Troy and I went and got it and I would say okay well your friend has $3,000 to

2354
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:09,568
Despair

2355
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:12,896
Good on him fine not everyone does

2356
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:13,920
Not everyone is

2357
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,224
Also

2358
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,528
Canadian Lakes

2359
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:22,368
Maybe Jericho

2360
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,952
Certainly

2361
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,536
Kickstarter

2362
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:33,888
Yeah I saw that again

2363
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:34,912
And all those

2364
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:37,984
That's the one I remember seeing it

2365
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:42,336
Yeah so also

2366
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:47,712
He got drunk and jumped out of a window

2367
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,528
Healthcare got 32 got

2368
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:54,624
Questions everything was taken care of got a bunch of surgery

2369
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,488
Hey I got an example to dumbass I don't know parts

2370
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:02,304
Talk about Healthcare

2371
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,072
Are there

2372
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,376
Demon doctor

2373
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,960
I'm going to finish up my all my rambling

2374
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:13,568
By giving you a little bit more of the Von mises Institute cideas

2375
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,104
About stuff

2376
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:17,152
They believe in child labor

2377
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:21,248
Child labor laws are stupid

2378
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,040
Charles Dickens certainly

2379
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:23,808
You got forced

2380
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,624
Build diamond

2381
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:29,440
Exactly there's no other way to create

2382
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:32,000
Their argument hinges largely on like

2383
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:34,560
Stupid anecdotal

2384
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:40,960
Hey kids no more about computers than adults do why can't they make money on it build them more money

2385
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:45,056
Answer my responses

2386
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:48,128
You know what I when I was a kid I

2387
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,664
Charge people to mow their lawn

2388
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:52,736
Any kid can do that with I will help you with your computer

2389
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:54,272
That's not child labor

2390
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:59,648
The child labor laws that are in place all you can't have kids working at your f****** Factory building

2391
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,440
Exactly the problem

2392
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:03,488
The Thin Line

2393
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,584
If a kid wants to like start up some sort of

2394
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,144
Warehouse just

2395
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,168
Star build computers

2396
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,032
Warehouses

2397
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,848
Yeah and they're they

2398
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,872
Pretend that it's like

2399
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:20,896
Kids

2400
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,200
Can't make money but what is their enterprising

2401
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,248
They f****** can

2402
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:26,784
Detroit Wright

2403
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:29,344
Need three grand that was at the Home Alone

2404
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:30,880
Proposal

2405
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,592
My head is how that would work as a movie

2406
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:53,408
About the Institute

2407
01:53:55,968 --> 01:54:02,112
I want to talk about their own oh they're racist

2408
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:05,696
Quotes from Devon meet

2409
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:11,328
Racist it is nonsensical to fight the racial hypothesis obvious fact

2410
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,864
It is vain to

2411
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:18,496
To deny that up till now certain races have contributed nothing or very little to the development of civilization

2412
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,312
And can in this sense be called inferior

2413
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:24,384
That's that's Von mises right there baby

2414
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,920
Here's another quote

2415
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:31,552
It may be admitted that the races different talented character

2416
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:34,624
There's no hope of ever seeing those differences resolved

2417
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,648
Still

2418
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:39,488
Free trade Theory shows that even the more compatible

2419
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:44,864
More capable races associated with the less capable

2420
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,960
Emmet's social cooperation brings them the advantage of higher productivity

2421
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,240
And total labor price

2422
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,616
Exploit the less

2423
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:02,016
That's probably a guy who existed

2424
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:06,624
In the austro-hungarian Empire

2425
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,928
Here's Murray rothbard

2426
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:12,768
He's on Twitter here's Murray rothbard

2427
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:17,120
The official the oppressed of American society which

2428
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:19,680
Just called in this case were black people women

2429
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,216
Xcetera

2430
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,032
They are a parasitic burden

2431
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:29,664
Forcing their hapless oppressors to provide an endless flow of benefithub boy

2432
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:32,736
You're making us all into Scrooge's

2433
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:36,320
Exactly so he also doesn't like women

2434
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:38,112
Murray rothbard

2435
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,952
This is from the Southern Poverty Law Center they wrote this up about him

2436
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:45,536
Equality is a siren song

2437
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:49,120
It can only mean the destruction of all that we cherish is Being Human

2438
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:52,960
Rothbard blames much of what he just likes on the meddling women

2439
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,008
In the mid-1800s

2440
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,800
Allegiant of Yankee women

2441
01:55:57,312 --> 01:56:02,944
Who are not fettered by the responsibilities of household work imposed voting rights for women on the nation

2442
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:03,968
Later

2443
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,992
Jewish women

2444
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:08,832
After raising funds from quote Top Jewish financiers

2445
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,136
Agitated for child labor laws

2446
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,696
Rothbart ads with evident disgust

2447
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:17,536
The quote dominant tradition of all these activists women he's

2448
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:19,584
Suggest is lesbianism

2449
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,216
Kiss each other

2450
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:30,080
To the current to head of the Institute I printed myself

2451
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:36,480
Hi is a guy named Walter block

2452
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,296
And he's responsible for a lot of the arguments movie

2453
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:42,112
Read from the nice Institute website.

2454
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,904
Defending blackmailers

2455
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,928
Some stuff like that

2456
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:46,720
He's a real contrarian a******

2457
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,256
He had this to say about

2458
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,024
Slavery

2459
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,584
Think about this in relation to

2460
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,608
Kanye West

2461
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:56,448
Free association is a very important aspect of Liberty

2462
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,728
It's crucial

2463
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:01,824
Indeed it slack was the major problem with slavery

2464
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,360
The slaves could not quit

2465
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:08,224
They were forced to associate with their masters when they would have vastly preferred not to do so

2466
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,784
Otherwise slavery wasn't so bad

2467
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,880
You could pick cotton sing songs be fed nice grool etcetera

2468
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:18,208
The only real problem was it this relationship was compulsory

2469
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,768
Violated the law free association

2470
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,096
And that of the slaves private property rights in their own person

2471
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:27,168
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 then

2472
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:32,032
I to a much smaller degree of course made partial slaves of the owners of establishments

2473
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,056
Like Woolworth

2474
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,872
No boy

2475
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:37,152
With Matt bad

2476
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,944
First of all there's that

2477
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:45,344
Yeah ditto the problem is you couldn't quit at all the other stuff Niels song

2478
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:50,208
Saying don't you know a damn we both

2479
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:51,488
You're not allowed

2480
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,256
The same way we were

2481
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,048
Why would it happen

2482
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,072
Back when you are starving

2483
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,608
Expensive thing in the whole time

2484
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:03,008
Why does my brain immediately.

2485
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:06,592
Maybe cuz that's exactly what he's f****** talking about interest

2486
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:07,872
It's crazy

2487
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:10,176
It's so crazy I mean there's the really basic

2488
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:11,456
6 versions of this bike

2489
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,992
Most Libertarians are again

2490
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,528
The Civil Rights Act cuz they're like

2491
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:18,624
Why should your business be required to serve black people if you don't want to

2492
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,952
When they talk about freedom of Association

2493
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:23,488
Talking about

2494
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,792
Like if you're in the underprivileged class

2495
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:26,816
You should be allowed to

2496
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,608
To associate with people who are pretty

2497
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:31,424
They're talkin about if you are

2498
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,192
White

2499
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:32,960
You shouldn't

2500
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:34,752
Have to deal with other people

2501
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:37,568
You shouldn't be forced to associate with other

2502
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:41,664
Labor laws and stuff like that

2503
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,456
Absolutely most Twisted way

2504
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,736
All of this is bull

2505
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,784
F****** b*******

2506
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,320
They're all racist comment

2507
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,088
Sounds like it

2508
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,880
I want more clip

2509
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:53,184
It's close this out

2510
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:56,256
Kane about the WWE

2511
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:00,608
No it does not

2512
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,448
Associate

2513
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:08,288
Associate

2514
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:09,056
See you then

2515
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,336
He was in for my money

2516
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:13,920
Yes about WWE in terms of libertarianism

2517
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:17,504
And this this answer is super f***.

2518
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,272
He's going to wave that

2519
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,040
Aflac

2520
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,112
It's

2521
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:25,952
If you're not far off but the details of the answer are so weird

2522
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,488
Cobalt

2523
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,048
World Wrestling Entertainment

2524
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:45,152
Liberty

2525
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:48,224
Fox now

2526
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:07,424
Merle Norman

2527
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:21,504
Where are we

2528
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:39,424
PowerPoint

2529
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,448
Her brother

2530
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:43,776
How goddamn stupid do you have to be

2531
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:47,872
To be so mad that you have to pay your taxes

2532
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:54,784
Libertarian as opposed to

2533
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,368
This business

2534
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,136
It has been

2535
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:02,208
Exploiting my labor for 20 years

2536
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:08,608
Plane first of all characters

2537
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:15,008
And then this demon from hell where I get accidentally burned from time to time

2538
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,312
The same business that's destroyed

2539
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:19,616
Most of my co-workers bodies

2540
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:25,248
Point where they all need surgery

2541
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:31,648
Family drug abuse or literal suicide but you got to remember this

2542
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:32,672
Was Gwen Derby

2543
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,440
Who is Big online

2544
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:39,840
Hey you go to rehab Weaver wellness policy

2545
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:41,376
The oldest wrestler stop dying

2546
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
Sylvester Patton

2547
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:48,800
The back real hard on that turnaround doing work for them

2548
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:51,616
Modus operandi

2549
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,408
Just the normal things

2550
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:59,040
And as well

2551
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:05,440
You know the free market dictates that you must enjoy getting hit in the head with a chair

2552
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:11,840
Real hardwood chairs

2553
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:12,608
Yeah

2554
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:15,424
I mean this is so crazy to me how

2555
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:19,008
Except for

2556
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,032
For his performance

2557
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:22,080
Interests buddy

2558
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:23,616
Indoctrinated him in

2559
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,920
Libertarian ideas

2560
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:28,992
Lot of time on the road

2561
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:32,576
You know you're reading a lot of books to do a lot of Rush Limbaugh on the road

2562
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:34,112
You know I probably got a doctrinated

2563
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,136
Like yeah

2564
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:37,952
First of somebody being like

2565
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:40,000
So down there.

2566
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:42,048
Who's won cliff

2567
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,072
Kyle Bass

2568
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:46,656
Okay who he subscribes to like

2569
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:49,216
Subscribe to his beliefs is a hedge fund manager

2570
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:53,312
I wish I still have this weapon because it turns out that

2571
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,872
A hedgehog

2572
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,152
Heyman

2573
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:58,432
Oh wow

2574
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:00,480
Okay which is interesting.

2575
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,248
Just for the parallels

2576
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:05,344
Someone must have like

2577
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,648
Touch20 little bit check

2578
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:09,184
Cuz you can't you can't

2579
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:14,816
Have a personal situation that is this bike as exploitative as professional wrestlers have

2580
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,096
And then be like

2581
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:19,680
Oh no the problem is that the business should have even more power

2582
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:21,728
Like Adventure give you guys insurance

2583
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,152
Gogoanime

2584
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:31,456
That would be so bad for him

2585
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:39,904
He could have told Shane and Stephanie heading that one of that burden

2586
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,928
Kind of did

2587
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,768
So so that's the end of exploration

2588
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,072
It's a mess

2589
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:51,168
There's so many real issues that he could wrestle later

2590
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,448
Spoiler time
