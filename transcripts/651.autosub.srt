1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,208
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,024
Fix it and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Alex Jones

7
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
What's up

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
My bright spot today is playing this game

10
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,312
A little bit called the sinking City

11
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
Typo

12
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Ambiance

13
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Kind of game

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Aquarius

15
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
The bright spot of it is

16
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
The city didn't sink

17
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,440
Pretty underwater there's a big flood going on because of the the Deep one

18
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
Alright

19
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
The esoteric order of Dagon is involved somehow

20
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,448
Did the specific Brightspot is there are little little

21
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
Monsters in

22
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
Stop the epic fail sometime

23
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
And the smallest one

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
That you killed make a sound

25
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
That I swear

26
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Is stolen

27
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
From Eternal Darkness like I swear that that is a sound that is directly

28
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Taken

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Brahma turtle

30
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Exactly the same

31
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:09,280
It triggers memories and me Darkness version of The Wilhelm scream

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,376
It feels like it and I've tried to look into it I Googled it

33
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,752
I can't find anybody that can confirm it

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
Convince me otherwise the makers of the game reach out to me and tell me it is now

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Not from Eternal Darkness

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
I won't believe them

37
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
I will think it's a conspiracy with a little bit of delight

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
A real tragedy according to me

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Because I I love that camera

40
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,680
The madness gauge and stuff like that we have such a fun innovation

41
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:53,056
Ruq Mega game that gradually makes itself unplayable

42
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Azure

43
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
You should have played me better assholes

44
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
That's how I like it

45
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
I think that's some of that was a little bit over sold

46
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
You know

47
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,624
Once you know the things are not really experience is really

48
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
Is immersive but if you're like me

49
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,768
And we're 1718 when I came out and

50
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
High all the time

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Close my f****** mind

52
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
I used to love

53
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
My buddy Nikki gif

54
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,008
Suelda play games like that and

55
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Resident Evil

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
But he is also like

57
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,664
Really really kind of scared dude

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
Butte playing behind the scream just gets startled by every great times

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Bring back video games

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
By the bright spot last episode was

61
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Spoilers

62
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
No spoilers at all but

63
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
Great man so good

64
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:56,032
It's so great yeah I am excited to play it eventually but

65
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,408
Do you know what I I realize I was playing it and I hadn't played the original in like

66
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
Forever

67
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,320
Back into the things that I love the most about playing that game which is basically creating

68
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
A series of Rube Goldberg machines to get one machine to trip into a trap and then knocked

69
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Sound like 30 different ones

70
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
It's just so much fun but you're good at your place

71
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,495
I'm glad you're enjoying it

72
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
In the most insist no spoilers

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Oh my God

74
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
You have no idea

75
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
February 8th

76
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Great

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Top marks

78
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
What are the best episodes he's ever done I think there's some problem

79
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
Okay

80
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Things going on in the world certainly and when

81
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
There's World intensity

82
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
That's when Alex is at his worst

83
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,031
I will check it out a little bit

84
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Hello

85
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Zombie walk

00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,175
First sugarbear.

87
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,807
Rhode Island skeleton

88
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,391
I'm a policy wonk

89
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Steve nowicki

90
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,303
The tiny cardboard Alex Jones says the bone broth is loaded with vitamin R thank you so much

91
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,679
Next big daddy crust

92
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
Muppet chimp says the new Technic ride drop

93
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Gigsalad bright spot I think it's about you and I

94
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
It is very special

95
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
A technocrat shout-out going out to wish

96
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
To Alexis and Jared

97
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,231
Many more moons going around Earth go around the Sun what is it

98
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,815
Strawberry Moon

99
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
This is the last time you guys many more moons and Jared happy anniversary

100
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Y'alls technocrat

101
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
I'm a policy wonk I have

102
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,527
A list for me

103
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
And then we're going

104
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
To come back

105
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
And I'm going to start the show over

106
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
F*** you

107
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
I got plenty of words for you but

108
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
At the end of the day

109
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
F*** you and your new world order

110
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
She rode in on

111
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
And all your s***

112
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Maybe the next few moments

113
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

114
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Real walk out of here tomorrow

115
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
And you never see me again

116
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Really what I want to do

117
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
I apologize to the

118
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

119
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
We better tomorrow

120
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,375
He is If today is tomorrow he's not better

121
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Baltimore

122
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,239
So he starts off as a sort of the tradition

123
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,567
Yeah sort of the more recent episodes

124
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,687
Declaring that

125
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Is upon us

126
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Okay and it's not Russia's fall

127
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,903
I hate to say it again we called what was happening they chose

128
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Black forces in water

129
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
I see into eastern Ukraine and Russia and other areas

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
They Russian

131
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
Episode population aeromax

132
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
When's mount

133
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
And this is

134
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
But attempt to

135
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Get the

136
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Come into the race

137
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
And start a major

138
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
On

139
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Believable

140
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,991
Not to be believed I mean 8

141
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
That's that's

142
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
That's

143
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
Gremlin

144
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
That's Kremlin there have you check their website

145
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
What narrative

146
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Yes believe that s***

147
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
We've seen this repeatedly in recent days like Alex is offering analysis

148
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
Situation Ukraine

149
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
It's over the top

150
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
But like

151
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
He claims that rushes The

152
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
The victim

153
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,199
But there's an attack on the Russian held areas in a sovereign country

154
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Which is weird

155
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
What that that there's a disconnect there

156
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
I think if somebody were to attack New Orleans

157
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,743
France would have course be like how dare you attack our French held territory in the United States right now

158
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Strange

159
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
I honestly don't think Alex's position is something he can seriously argue because essentially no one in the International Community

160
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
Formally recognize recognize areas

161
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,823
Like her me or the Dumbo sorry Jaden is being legitimately part of Russian territory

162
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
He's calling me Russian held territories and for him to say those words he has to understand that they're holding

163
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
That without the right to do so

164
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,367
Also I want to point out that I don't just trying to soft sell the idea of

165
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,695
These areas are rightfully Russia

166
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Who population in these areas are like

167
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
98% Russia

168
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,351
The argument here is that the people are essentially Russian

169
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
I'm so bored

170
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
Hear it really should be part of Russia they're all Russian

171
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
That's what struggling

172
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
The most recent census in Ukraine was done in 2001 although attempts have been made to do one sense but they've all been po

173
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Postponed

174
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,063
But don't boss region is made up of 20 blast the luhansk

175
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
And donuts

176
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
In the most recent

177
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,695
Scientist depopulation of donuts was

178
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
56.9% Ukrainian

179
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
And 38.2% Rush

180
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
Russia practically 92%

181
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
Approximately the same ratio exist

182
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Aloha.

183
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
With a 58% Ukrainian at 39% Russian

184
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
For some comparison to population of Texas is 39.3% Hispanic or Latino so for Alex

185
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Argue that these areas of Ukraine or actually Russian

186
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,343
He's going to have to get himself in a weird position does Mexico ever decide they want to occupy two

187
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Fortunately think again my head

188
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
Hey beat this is exactly like what if

189
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
There's a massive number of Mexicans who lived in Texas and they just said

190
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Well Texas is ours now

191
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,215
Alex will be real bad about that and then the numbers are exactly the same there's an exact percentage

192
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
Well

193
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Alex Wood look

194
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
No

195
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
What's going on here is that Alex has misremembering one of his talking points from 2014 when he was

196
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
For Russia to Annex

197
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
XtraMath

198
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,071
Peninsula is 58.3% Russian a 24.3% Ukrainian

199
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,423
So when the annexation was happening the pro-russia talking point was the premiere was base

200
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Physically Russian

201
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
So they should be able to claim the territory

202
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Alex is conflating

203
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
This argument with

204
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,919
The statistics that were thrown around regarding the status of South ossetia and abkhazia

205
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
I was just make

206
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
2008

207
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,039
The Georgian territories that Russia

208
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
The leaves are there

209
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,463
Both are within Georgia's recognize borders but South ossetia population is only about 7% Georgia

210
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
With most of the rest being our session

211
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,167
Similarly the population of abkhazia is over half abkhazian with a minority being at the mcgeorge's

212
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Because these

213
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Ravens had these demographic profiles books like Alex argued that they weren't really part of Georgia is a wanted to be part of

214
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
You should be

215
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
That was part of the talking points justifying things

216
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
It made sense then

217
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Make spice

218
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Texas much sense now

219
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,623
Alex doesn't actually know what's going on in the world right now but he knows that he's invest

220
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,231
Didn't create a party in this conflict

221
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
In opposition to the evil global

222
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
And it shows in the way he's just recycling talking

223
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
Complaints that weren't accurate to begin with

224
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
And wouldn't even be relevant to the current situation Eva

225
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Even if they were

226
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,615
Another thing that's important to bring up here is the numbers of Russian people compared to Ukrainian people in the Don Bosco region

227
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
It's pretty difficult to assess

228
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
Partially because of intentional actions taken by Putin

229
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,367
The government of Russia is carried out a policy of passport ization as it relates to the residence of Don Bosco

230
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Whereby the issue passports

231
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
The people unmasked

232
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
This is a couple of

233
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Particularly dicey side effects

234
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Probably the chief among them

235
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,167
Is it allows Russia to artificially inflate the number of citizens they have in the region

236
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,287
And the protection of those citizens would likely be a major piece of any argument that was made

237
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
If they want to talk

238
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Occupy oradix the territory

239
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:37,247
The real-world situation is complicated and I would be lying if I said that I understood everything that's going on than most of it but

240
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
But I can tell you with absolute certainty

241
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Is it Alex's

242
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Wheatley winging this coverage

243
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
I'm making s*** up based on things he remember saying and past shows

244
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
When he was rationalizing crushes Act

245
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Their neighbors

246
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Etienne has the fingerprint is there it's

247
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
Very clear

248
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Talking Tom

249
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Is old

250
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Wrong and arela

251
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,239
Weird it's weird that you would bring it I mean obviously it's

252
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
For him it's not like any you know

253
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
God bless Russia and more just like

254
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
I have no skills

255
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,271
And I remember this thing so I'm just going to do them just to read redo that one

256
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
This is bad

257
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
This is pretty bad

258
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
This is bad I mean it's a propaganda is bad it's not they're not even trying that hard

259
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
It's bad

260
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
Yeah yeah

261
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Sloppy

262
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
I'm not being the tip of the spear

263
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,263
It really boils down to is like

264
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Less

265
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
Necessarily intrinsic support of Russia and

266
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
Weird worldview that Alex's

267
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,063
Created for himself where Russia is an enemy of his imaginary enemies

268
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
And therefore he supports

269
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Them

270
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
And so any conflict

271
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,231
Like that what's going on in Ukraine any kind of

272
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Possible conflict

273
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Is attention

274
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,863
Between Alex's enemies and on the other hand

275
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Russia who are

276
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,239
Against Alex's animes and therefore he'll always side with Russia

277
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
It's very it's very

278
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Confusing

279
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
I'm stupid

280
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
This one's

281
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
This one's a little

282
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
I'm going to have to call this floppy work on everybody's part

283
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
I think it's sloppy work on Putin fart

284
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
Dreading NATO's doing sloppy s***

285
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
The news

286
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Alex

287
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,207
Everybody the only people not doing right now

288
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
Are everybody else who is confused as to why these assholes are fighting a war

289
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Yeah

290
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
If i m

291
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
You know you can only do such a good job when you're

292
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
When the whole point is I got confused

293
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
Yeah apparently

294
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Unbelievable

295
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
False flag

296
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Kindergarten

297
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
Text for this and now here we are

298
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Hillary Clinton the people representer

299
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
We president now

300
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
It's a Roundtable

301
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Clinton crime syndicate

302
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Obama's

303
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
Soros's crime syndicate the roller lock

304
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
That are

305
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
What in the world are biomedical martial law

306
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
So here's what I'm supposed to believe

307
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
I'm supposed to believe that a combination of Hillary Obama and Soros is individual crime syndicate have come together in there

308
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Spiralizer

309
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,927
Control into a World War that'll probably be nuclear in nature

310
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
But they can't take out Alex

311
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
How could they

312
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,863
Like you supposed to be the most dangerous guy in the world to them because he has their number

313
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
And they tried to recruit him because he's so damn good

314
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
Let us go let him live when they have the ability and willingness big actions will cause the deaths of millions or billions of people

315
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,663
It seems f****** dumb and honestly they could kill Alex so easily

316
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
He's so unhealthy that any kind of heart attacker was open.

317
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:54,623
Do the toxicology they be like oh my God I'm sure he died just because he's

318
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,207
Is Alex be less suspicious than Breitbart having a heart attack

319
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
It really would be

320
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
Yeah I don't know I will say they're probably waiting for the right moment big anime

321
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,983
They want to do is they want to see everything he's built laidlow you know

322
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,383
And then really step his nose in it

323
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,735
Everything has to have sort of a dramatic Arc

324
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
Cotuit Alex's world

325
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Circle

326
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
I say we defeated you Alex where's your God now

327
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Probably

328
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,703
Anyway also Alex has no evidence that the bombing he's discussing here was a false flag

329
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Kindergarten

330
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:46,847
Do the kindergarten in the Levant region in Ukraine which was shelled reportedly by pro-russia

331
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Separatists

332
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
Attacking from the East

333
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
According to Ukrainian soldiers

334
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Who said they did not return fire

335
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,599
Russia put out a statement claiming the Ukrainian stage the whole thing which is

336
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,511
We are now in a position where folks like Boris Johnson or saying these acts or false flag being done by the Russians and their folks like Alex

337
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
A false flag

338
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,095
Being done to the Russians and there's no way to move forward

339
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
It's just

340
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,935
Alright I look okay

341
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
I know

342
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
The

343
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
The warrant

344
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
But has Boris Johnson sent

345
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
It's Putin a box

346
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,943
Chocolate or flowers or anything to to thank him for

347
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Not

348
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,575
You know allowing the news cycle to last long enough for Boris have to resign

349
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
Yeah probably

350
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
I was trying to think of what the UK version

351
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
KB

352
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,887
A crumpet I could be it could be

353
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
It's it's very

354
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,407
Complicated to like this idea of everybody saying everything is a false flag

355
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
I think it's awful

356
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
And I think that it's really dangerous in terms of

357
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
The president could say

358
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
In terms of people understanding what's happening in the world

359
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
Like if you allow for everybody to do

360
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
Presume that things are false flags and nothing means any

361
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
What's 1

362
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,399
Once Biden came out before a false flag or attack at all happened and said

363
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
We think they're going to do a false flag at that moment reality cease to matter I kind of agree with you now

364
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
But I do think there's one stipulation that I would make

365
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
And that is that there is a possibility that there was

366
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,295
Intelligence that there was going to be a false flag is that the case

367
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
Calling it out he's something

368
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
That would be awesome

369
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Strategic relevance

370
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
The issue that I have

371
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,023
Is that if this happens more

372
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,327
It's all over

373
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
Alex says everything is a Volkswagen that's her dad

374
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
Just do record

375
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
You understand this is how he's information works

376
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
The idea of this

377
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
The government

378
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,871
Would also date to get into that game is a little bit

379
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
It's not good

380
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,247
If it's not an actual at example of something that they had solid evidence

381
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
Or intelligence

382
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
It becomes

383
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
Like wild nothing means anything anymore

384
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
I mean

385
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
From my understanding of how that would go

386
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Alright

387
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
In order for Biden

388
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
To come out and say with the backing of the

389
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
In community

390
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
We know they're going to do a false flag

391
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
That essentially has to me neither

392
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
We know that the Russians

393
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,127
I have been communicating got a false flag attack is going to happen so we're telling them week

394
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
You can hear them right

395
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Or

396
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,223
It is we're making this b******* up

397
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,879
And so we're telling them that we're lying about this stuff but they can't say out loud that were lying about it cuz it's going to look like

398
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
They're lying about

399
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Like this

400
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,559
Once we get into a situation where now we're in an infinite Loop of well if I do this it's going to look like they do this and I do

401
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,703
It looks like that we don't know what don't know what the

402
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Phuc yea

403
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
It's Fox

404
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
But if it's

405
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,079
The first option then you kind of understand

406
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
The the

407
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
The tactic being used although it's

408
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,247
Weird but I don't enjoy it

409
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,135
I don't I don't like to hear those words coming out of anybody's mouth or a historian

410
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Did anybody stopped Atkins

411
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
Consult us like we've spent the last 5-6 years talking about false Flags almost non-stop I wouldn't

412
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,423
Anything to add

413
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Have to think

414
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,007
Giving recommendations

415
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
Is no false flag

416
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,895
Volkswagen should only exist in the fictional area of Alex Jones's world

417
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,223
So we have a situation in Ukraine obviously

418
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,039
Plates

419
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,135
Sure he's also got a situation in Canada that's getting out of control

420
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
Arresting

421
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
Without bail

422
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Peaceful protesters

423
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
You know it wouldn't just be in

424
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Situation

425
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
The capital of Ottawa

426
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Arrest

427
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
People in jail

428
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
We don't tell you why they arrested

429
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
We have the Sean of

430
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Blocky the preacher

431
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
Who is now facing

432
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Prison is a terrorist

433
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
Calling him a terrorist for praying

434
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:17,952
Alex is language is really bad there cuz it makes it sound like the guy's son got arrested but is actually just

435
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Article on Pulaski

436
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Arrested

437
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Covering

438
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
What would a

439
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
To be a large story here but you got to really look at

440
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
The details is offering and you can put together

441
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
Pieces

442
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
He's talking about

443
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
To hear the Essential Elements of the story

444
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
1 people are being arrested

445
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
Not in Ottawa

446
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
Two people are being held without bail

447
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,064
And 3rd pawlowski as been arrested

448
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
And there's some mention of his son

449
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
Story is that there are massive numbers of arrest for no reason

450
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
Who are then being denied bail

451
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
That's the impression he's Sunday

452
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,448
In reality this is just about one person order pawlowski

453
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
An article about him Alex's read on Rebel meme

454
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,616
Is it just came out on February 16th that pawlowski had been

455
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
Denied bail and relationship took place

456
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
Kouts Alberta away from the Ottawa situation

457
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:19,136
Valesky's

458
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
In Rebel

459
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,232
Alex is lying about what happened

460
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
The Dow and the all of the

461
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
For one thing

462
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,424
I was just claiming one of the Border Blockheads but it did

463
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,544
The border crossing from Kouts into Montana was being blocked and Pulaski was arrested

464
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
At that

465
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,920
Arrested is home but had to do with actions that he took

466
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
In relation

467
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,272
To the bi being at the couch walking

468
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Right right

469
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
The second lies that he was arrested for prank

470
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
With the truckers

471
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
That's absolutely not true

472
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Early in February in agreement have been

473
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,816
Construct between the lawyers for the truck blockade and the RCMP

474
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
That would allow for a couple Lanes of traffic

475
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
To be open

476
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
Allowed

477
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
Have some flow of goods over

478
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Over the Border

479
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:10,592
These later Pulaski was recorded on video giving a speech at a place called The Smugglers Saloon

480
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
Where you passionately arguing that

481
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
The protesters should go back on their deal

482
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
And that they needed to be willing to sacrifice their lives

483
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
For the cause of

484
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,832
I guess getting rid of Public Health measures

485
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
This constitutes excitement inside the protesters to go against an agreement they'd already made with the police

486
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
So he got arrested

487
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,424
Ultimately the fact that he keeps going around wherever he stands to get a bunch of attention and desperately tries to

488
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
To get arrested

489
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Made the courts

490
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Beside baby

491
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
Stood a really strong chance of reoffending if he was released

492
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,432
Also decided that his defense

493
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Could not assert free-speech ground since

494
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,784
What's Canada's Charter doesn't Protect free speech

495
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,160
That would incite other people to commit criminal activity that's trouble

496
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,560
Shouldn't have done it in the wrong country buddy stay on this border should have gone to Montana

497
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,168
Incidentally the couch border-crossing was where the RCMP and covered a large cache of weapons

498
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
Sand a little while after Pulaski gave you the passion speech

499
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,312
To never give up and called the blockade their Alamo

500
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
Four of the people arrested at the blockade were charged with

501
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Conspiracy to murder RCMP member

502
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
That's going around

503
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Like over the weekend Hospital in Ottawa

504
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
Close at the campus due to a bomb threat

505
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,696
A woman was arrested for making a bomb threat against the mayor of Windsor

506
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
A twenty-year-old

507
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,768
Ohio is likely facing felony charges

508
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
We're trying to call in a bomb threat to the Ottawa Sheriff's Department

509
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,424
I think he tried to because he was real idiot and

510
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,264
You trying to reach Canada but I accidentally called the city in Ohio called Ottowa

511
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
There's apparently an Ottawa Ohio

512
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
A bomb threat referencing Public Health measures then called back

513
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,712
Kentucky been shot but when he said where he was pleased.

514
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
Confused because it didn't match any location in town

515
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:00,672
This whole thing was busted and he admitted he was lying and just trying to waste public resources responding to a fake report of someone being shot

516
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
Great because he was mad about public

517
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
Health measures in another

518
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
It's just

519
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
The creativity

520
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,888
And the problem-solving on display

521
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
From these people

522
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Is just

523
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
I mean

524
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
You don't think of

525
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
Convoys as being hotbeds of ingenuity

526
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
But the way they're going about

527
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Getting the

528
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,456
Stated directive that they have which is to obtain

529
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
I don't get a lot of

530
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
Overthrowing the world's government right

531
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,168
Ottawa

532
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
And nothing's really been at

533
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,824
Lake Pulaski

534
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,664
Comes of it there's going to be a lot of really G

535
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,504
People who might start to think their last allegedly peaceful solution

536
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Has been a failure

537
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
And I like it

538
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,160
Blackpilled as they say

539
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,744
You can see here in this case study a great example of how Alex lies

540
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
To build narrative

541
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
The actual story is just one guy who got arrested

542
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,472
Stood for inciting people to violate an agreement that they made with the police who is denied bail because of a documented pattern of behavior

543
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
Alex reports that is people getting arrested all over Canada not being told why they're getting arrested because of the emergency act and then being denied

544
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
It's b*******

545
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
Yeah but at the very least

546
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
It is

547
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,928
Aimed at getting people who are already notoriously violent and on a Harris

548
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
At knife's Edge

549
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,792
20 no no this is terrifying

550
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Yeah probably

551
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,144
He's discussing the arrests that are happening

552
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
As it relates to the Ottawa protest

553
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
What appears to be several

554
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
Thousand

555
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Man

556
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,200
Black ski mask in police uniforms

557
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,320
And they already started the arrest of the leaders

558
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,392
The trucker Freedom Convoy

559
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
And they are

560
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,744
Not charging them and singer being held without

561
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Bale

562
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Martial law

563
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,216
Infantis the police may not have been wearing black

564
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
Ski mask foot just like balaclava

565
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Are you really cold

566
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Super cold

567
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:30,688
You can find plenty of images of police not wearing masks or just wearing covid masks

568
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
Who's apart of Alex's branding of his enemy forces but it's also important to remember that even if everything Alex's thing there

569
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
There were true

570
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
That would still not be martial law

571
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
He definitely has no idea what that term even me

572
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
Does it matter

573
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
It does

574
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
Well I mean to you

575
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
Cuz he calls himself mr. martial law

576
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,680
I think that would be the first sign that he doesn't know what it means it could be

577
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Also Alex is just lying again

578
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
The organisers who were arrested have been charged

579
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Emerald

580
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,688
Was charged with counselling to commit mischief and she still awaiting a bail hearing as of

581
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
The preparation of this episode

582
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,808
She may get bail she's not been denied it yet that's for sure

583
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,464
Chris Barber is another one of the organisers that got arrested but he was already released on bail by Friday the same day

584
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Episode that were list

585
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Listening to

586
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Who was charged with counselling to commit mischief

587
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Counseling to disobey a court order

588
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,216
Counseling to obstruct police and Mr that interferes with the use and enjoyment

589
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
So he has

590
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
He has been

591
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
I am so annoyed

592
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
By every

593
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Legal system in the world that uses

594
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
The word mischief

595
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Didn't

596
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
A crime

597
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Simply Misti

598
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
It seems like they had a prank

599
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,768
You can't say the same thing

600
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:54,912
Mann packing is another Convoy organizer in l a

601
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Lee public statements about

602
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Is belief in white supremacy

603
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,568
He was arrested and charged with mistress counseling to commit the offence of mischief

604
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,640
Counseling to disobey a court order in counseling to abstract

605
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,736
Deer court appearance over the weekend but as of the timer recording this I'm not

606
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:13,600
Entirely sure if he got Bail or not but he may have any may still get it in French

607
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
I'm not I'm not certain

608
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,256
Just making things up because the details he's making up fit the narrative that he want

609
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Pasta salad

610
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
He needs to sell the feeling that Gestapo blacksky

611
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
Mask-wearing shockproof surrounding up all the Convoy leadership

612
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
The staves holding them

613
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
Without charges indefinitely but none of it's true

614
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
He makes this s*** up because if he didn't

615
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
He wouldn't

616
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
Be able to create the app

617
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Impotent

618
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,944
That he needs is audience to stay into

619
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Some captive

620
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
That's that

621
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
Yeah it's a little weird

622
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
It is a little bit weird how

623
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,440
Hard the American far right is

624
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,536
Really pushing this I guess assault on Canada's

625
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Sovereignty

626
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,704
Boy are they

627
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
If it is

628
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,080
Another country had done this type of s*** like if if the situations were reversed

629
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
Bright

630
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,664
Half of Canada's parliament is like

631
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,064
Hey y'all better go down to f****** America and really kill those guys as much as you can because their governments evil

632
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
OneAmerica do like sanctions or some s***

633
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
Why can't Trudeau be like hey guess what

634
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,744
Tucker Carlson if you coming to my country again you're dead

635
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,144
Navigate to far are being taken in

636
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,496
In terms of like freezing the donations that come in through like GoFundMe

637
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,312
Give us time to go kind of stuff I think is

638
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Maybe the appropriate

639
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
Level up

640
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Trying to stop

641
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
Influence

642
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,528
But yeah I don't I don't know it is it is really weird

643
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,928
Yeah where you intellectually get around that some like Alex Wood is that it's not about Canada. About their sovereignty

644
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,256
Protecting their sovereignty from the global crime syndicate

645
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:02,656
That is running the country right now I understand but sometimes it is about sovereignty cuz that's what you're attacking

646
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,728
But it's not really if you say it's not

647
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:12,128
I didn't consider the old

648
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,944
Husband charged

649
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Polish immigrant

650
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Preacher

651
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Popular preacher

652
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
Who winning the Convoy

653
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Jasmine arrested

654
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,672
And they're not even charging him and they're saying that

655
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,976
He's being held without bail

656
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
That is also in the news for the other individual

657
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Two men arrested

658
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
They're saying

659
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
Will not say

660
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,704
Where they are what happened to him

661
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
This is martial law

662
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,104
They're clearly trying to start a shooting War ladies and gentlemen and

663
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
The corner where folks have no other choice

664
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
We do not

665
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Need

666
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
To go out

667
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
And start shooting words

668
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,952
This point that's a really interesting perspective because you really have to ask yourself what Alex is trying to

669
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
To do here

670
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:05,376
He's a lying about the situation that all these Convoy organizers organizers in Pulaski are in in order to frame it is

671
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Kind of a martial law scenario

672
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,056
His explanation for why the government is doing these things is that they're hoping to trigger a shooting War which Alex's supposedly against

673
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
I don't believe that

674
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
If I was truly opposed to the triggering of a shooting War then

675
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,248
He would want to report the information about the protesting the arrest

676
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
Accurately as possible

677
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,904
Sensationalizing things only Ally people to drawing a conclusion

678
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
Possibly taking impulsive emotional actions based

679
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,024
On those inaccurate conclusions if they were

680
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,864
The only reason you would lie like this with these dramatized

681
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
Details specifically tailored

682
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
To talk on the very specific fears and paranoia is

683
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
That you've built in your audience

684
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,800
Is tomato kind of impulsive action more likely

685
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,640
The Fingerprints of Alex's intentions are really visible in his actions here

686
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,760
He wants to escalate the situation with the sort of hopelessness in the audience

687
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
How about any peaceful solution

688
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
To the problems that they face

689
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
His actions really don't makes

690
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
In terms of any other contacts

691
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Text that I can play

692
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Well I mean

693
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,000
I would say if

694
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
If

695
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
My

696
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
Favorite guy was in the middle of saying hey

697
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:15,520
You guys better stop attacking Ukraine otherwise we're going to have to save everybody's life in Ukraine

698
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
And everybody's like

699
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
No

700
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,200
Nobody's doing that please don't do that and he's like yeah you guys are just trying to make us go into Ukrainian save everybody's life in Ukraine

701
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
Right now

702
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Is that Mike

703
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Make your

704
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:32,160
They're trying to search you anymore that's what they're trying to do

705
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
Kind of sea slide

706
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
Similarity

707
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Yeah

708
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,424
I don't actually know if I necessarily thinking that Alex wants like shooting

709
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Start

710
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
But I think

711
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,800
He's really disappointed that things seem to be

712
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,616
On the downslope

713
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
Climax seems to have been reached in terms of the actual protesters falling action now

714
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,856
And that's not really as fun for him it's not as profitable right

715
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:09,280
I think you can see the little bit of a transition over to Ukraine narratives the Convoy is no longer the most important

716
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,584
Take On The World

717
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,984
And probably still the most important person in the world

718
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Power ranking

719
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,848
Is the same unless updated you would probably tell us

720
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:28,736
Baby Pulaski is the most important person in the world map

721
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
Tucker still

722
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:34,880
I know I know he's more of a future pics

723
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:39,488
So we've got to look at some other information coming out of Canada

724
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
Beliefs of the volunteered for this

725
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Wearing balaclava black

726
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,520
Jordan police are resigning or saying no

727
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
They

728
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
I'll join the protest

729
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,624
This is fun but it's true

730
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,720
But wouldn't that work that is the most enjoyable moment for you though if

731
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
If the tow truck Skies

732
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:19,168
Join the protests are like haha that's backfired on you you idiots that's enough that's from a movie

733
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,776
That's what you want just lying about the Ottawa chief of police resigning

734
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,360
That's what he saw police resigning or whatever

735
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:32,992
Peter slowly resign not because he was so offended by the idea of arresting these protesters with because he was catching

736
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Very severe criticism

737
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
For letting the situation deteriorated

738
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
To the point that it

739
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Yeah yeah

740
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,952
Special units of police were brought in wearing black

741
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
Ski masks

742
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
The tons of police are resigning

743
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,608
He built on the foundation of

744
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Of the police chief

745
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Resignation

746
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,472
As for the tow truck drivers thing that's just made up to

747
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,824
You can find video of police Towing the trucks out and there are tow truck drivers

748
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
Forming a mutineer everything

749
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Inside of a movie but it's

750
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,760
It's not real I am Spartacus

751
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
I am truck driver

752
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
So Newsweek had my interview with the

753
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,976
Video of a lion's Towing Ibrahim Nasir who said that he

754
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,536
But was very clear that is

755
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
Not be interpreted

756
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,608
To be for or against

757
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
The truckers protest

758
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,704
His concern seemed to mostly be a logistical one

759
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,544
My employees are not trained to work in that kind of an entire

760
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
The liability issues associated with that situation

761
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
They're just two Gray

762
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Newsweek reached out to a bunch of

763
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
More companies and they all had no

764
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Global News spoke to Mark Graves the president of the provincial Towing Association of Ontario said

765
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
The water they're sticking points was that the

766
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Government

767
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
Give to first show it will protect

768
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,256
The industry from threats to safety and busy

769
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,072
It seems like many of the companies working

770
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:56,192
Concerned about possible retaliation from Convoy protesters if we were to participate in the removal

771
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
The trucks

772
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,824
What are the safety issues involved definitely forecast of snow that is a piece of it

773
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,152
But the other issue was A&P towing companies had been receiving death

774
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:11,040
The president of the Towing and Recovery Association of Alberta told Global News quote

775
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
I can confirm that

776
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
Three of our members had received threatening

777
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Phone calls

778
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
What company was threatened

779
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,488
Just because their trucks were seen near the blockade

780
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Couch

781
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,560
So as it relates to the tow truck companies

782
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,168
What's their joining in with the protesters as it is the fear of terrorist threats

783
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
The protesters are make

784
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,288
Trucks with their company identifier

785
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Participated in Telugu

786
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,592
Top that's what I'm

787
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Did not

788
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,224
For my Mutiny and join in with the police against the police

789
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,368
Want to be on record before going to tow these trucks that I am against

790
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
The Convoy

791
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,696
Exactly wouldn't want the right wing

792
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
Reading I would want Alex Jones reading my tow trucking companies name out on the air all the time

793
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,400
No that's obviously

794
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,472
The concern is retaliation in the safety of people

795
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
The other 12 is that

796
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
If your run

797
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,152
Company you will inevitably probably work with

798
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,760
Trucking companies

799
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
Some relation

800
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
It wasn't one of these articles even

801
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,392
A concern about

802
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Even though it's a

803
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
A small amount of the

804
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
Total number of truckers in Canada

805
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
People can

806
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,328
Destroy your business on social media

807
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Yeah like

808
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
Be a sex like

809
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
With that right

810
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
I guess partially it's

811
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Again just

812
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Out of fear of reprisal

813
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,616
Right right right I I like

814
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,688
I like that America has learned one thing

815
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
From our war on terror

816
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Starting a war against

817
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
Terror does not work

818
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
Being a terrorist

819
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
Works eggs

820
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,000
Usually large number of times that they in a row

821
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,328
It doesn't get you the girl you want but it

822
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
It gets a gold gets it gets

823
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
Bing

824
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
It gets stung

825
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
Done

826
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
So Alex gets back to talk about Ukraine

827
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
And

828
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,872
Find this to be strange he seems to be

829
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
Promote this idea that

830
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Like a man

831
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,248
Tried to be cool about this

832
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Russia

833
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Pat tried to not escalate

834
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Couldn't have tried to play things down

835
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
What

836
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
I had just come out and said what we already know

837
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
There's a massive Western offensive

838
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Attacking

839
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
Russian Hill area

840
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Genocide

841
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Take me to

842
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
No one says

843
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Provocation

844
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Dual

845
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
What's the weather in Childress throats

846
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Cross the river

847
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
And I just worked

848
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
Lost a war

849
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
What happened

850
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Attacked

851
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
Many people chosen this route

852
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
The children's throats

853
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
That will be too much

854
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
I'm actually kind of

855
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
That's f***** up

856
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
That's the second time in this episode that Alex

857
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,112
Is brought up the movie The Last duel so I think we know what he was doing Thursday night

858
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
What's up

859
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,464
Paprika movie

860
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,816
Getting this information from but I do not think it's accurate

861
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,144
What is worth much like posturing with nuclear weapons

862
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,216
Making accusations about genocide

863
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,264
Can system strategies when it comes to navigating

864
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
In the lead-up to hostilities

865
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,592
I don't

866
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
These kind of

867
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Allegation

868
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,456
Sirius and

869
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,272
Be thrown around and want to minimize them

870
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
But

871
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
This is something that he doesn't.

872
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,952
He recently claimed it was going on in dunbar's looked a lot like the genocide of Rock

873
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,584
In 2014 for your antics and Crimea he said that Russians were being the subject of ethnic cleansing

874
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,936
In 22008 Medvedev was president

875
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,240
He to claim the Russians were being a chemically cleanse

876
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
In Georgia prior to launching a war against

877
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,432
What are the key justifications of Putin and the Russian government gives for taking hostile action against neighboring states

878
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,784
Is it an obligation to protect Russians who live there we're under attack

879
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:32,416
The evidence that they are specifically Undertaker's never really provided and then

880
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
To protect Russians

881
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
The region

882
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,304
In reality it's actually Russia who generally is engaged in these acts

883
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Sabathani cleansing

884
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,448
In 2008 they rounded up Georgians in South ossetia and tortured them killed them and burned their home

885
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:50,592
The annexation of Crimea Russia is targeted Crimean tatars and attempted to reduce their numbers

886
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
In the country

887
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
Honestly this is a sick s***

888
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,015
Alex is so blinded by his own imaginary fight against

889
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,855
Buying into war propaganda put up a really dangerous power

890
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,927
Just because he's decided to believe that they oppose the imaginary enemies

891
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
But he has to

892
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
And not only that he uses pretend X

893
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,095
Geopolitics to convince his audience that they should support this stuff too

894
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
Let's grow sets

895
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
Like I said this is really like

896
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
The topic is

897
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Very serious

898
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
And I almost could not be more C

899
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,079
No I mean

900
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,639
Radio host

901
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,223
Claiming somebody is committing a genocide

902
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,831
Recent historically has gotten a lot of people

903
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
Like this is

904
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
This is the type of

905
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
You see this

906
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,071
You see all the time just like hey look I don't know man

907
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,423
They're committing genocide I guess Russia's the hero on this one just like let's

908
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,311
It's it's a laziness to on Alex's part

909
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
To not recognize

910
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,175
The historical trends

911
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
At least over the last

912
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
20 years

913
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
15 years of

914
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
These lead UPS

915
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
To attempt

916
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
2

917
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
Invade areas and neighboring countries

918
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Have

919
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,791
What preceded them has been largely

920
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,887
Surrounding new clear

921
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
Weapons

922
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,495
And then accusations that Russians are being

923
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
What ethnic Lee climb

924
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,055
Then this area

925
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
8 something

926
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
That Alex

927
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
Has every reason to understand

928
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
Is part of a pattern

929
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
He just buys

930
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,295
Whatever Rodger says because he believes them to be

931
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
The enemy of his enemy

932
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
You months ago

933
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:45,535
12 for the past several years Putin has been like hey if NATO expands

934
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
I'm going to be very aggressive

935
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,423
And then NATO's expanding or is it sits

936
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,495
Appearing to and he's being very aggressive

937
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Now

938
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:01,663
To believe however somehow that in the intervening short stretch of time Ukraine was like

939
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Now's our chance

940
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
Get these 10 guys

941
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
That would be a little bit

942
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
It would be it would be

943
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
Yeah it if you have to kind of even see

944
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
Potential

945
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Strategic reasons

946
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Spore

947
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,095
You know invading areas like a dumb boss

948
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,167
Them as

949
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,983
Russian held territory against separatist

950
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
Russian back groups

951
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
In that because

952
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
That is a check

953
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,919
Ukraine joining NATO

954
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
Has been pointed out by

955
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
More less

956
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:46,719
Alex has fallen for some s*** here is all above board in terms of their actions

957
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
And in the circumstances

958
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,303
Has fallen for some dumb s***

959
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,631
I mean it's just on added level of like

960
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
The f*****-up

961
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,543
Instigators are all around and I don't understand any of

962
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
But I do understand that it's

963
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,687
Pretty clear Putin's goal is to keep NATO away

964
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,759
Who is the only person trying to win nothing

965
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,831
Everybody else right now is trying to

966
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
Keep him from quitting that thing

967
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
But since it seems like a very simple game

968
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,255
Doesn't seem like there is a Winning State

969
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,399
Really call back for another few years until

970
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
That seems like that could be the case

971
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Cities base

972
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,359
Geopolitical issues Visa Ozzy Ukraine and Canada

973
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,431
Alex is Revelations of his own past

974
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,271
I remember

975
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
Reading

976
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,767
Society

977
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,399
Going

978
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Clothing

979
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Zbigniew Brzezinski

980
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
Puppy Bowl

981
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
People like Cecil Rhodes

982
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,527
They indeed said they would do these

983
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
This

984
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
Is important

985
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:23,487
Because it has to be believed here then essentially all of his conspiracy theories and all of his supposed knowledge of the world is rooted in the

986
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
A society

987
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,095
You rather stupid magazine and then pretended to go read the books they were siding

988
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,423
I can guarantee 100% he never read those

989
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:38,335
He has absolutely no ability to discuss what they're about Beyond prepackaged talking points that probably came from the John Birch

990
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,151
Materials that tell you learned about the books from in the first place

991
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
That's all he knows about these books

992
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,855
Well there's no way that the John Birch Society is going to tell you about these books without severely coloring your a

993
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
Fraction of what they are going

994
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
Going to be before

995
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
That is true

996
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Simply put

997
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:01,119
There's an argument to be made that Alex's entire career has been one long occasionally entertaining charade wear a diaper

998
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,655
Pretends to know stuff but really

999
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,983
He's just yelling about stuff you read in his dad's red-baiting magazine

1000
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,311
Honestly this makes sense and it's what we've kind of

1001
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Suspected

1002
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Known

1003
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,967
Painfully written in a deeply bigoted extreme right-wing publication

1004
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:22,367
Alex is probably reading it on a regular basis at a time before his brain mature tube

1005
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,791
Read them over some of the article titles from their issues from like 1994 basically read like a call sheet for all of Alex's early now

1006
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
Narratives are some titles

1007
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
Pushing for a world currency

1008
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,983
Gun grabbers Global Gestapo

1009
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,847
Bono Purple Penguin

1010
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,503
1995 the article obsessed with OKC conspiracy theories

1011
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,575
Play Issues the b******* kind of stuff that Alex sites all the time

1012
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:58,719
They had an issue that was so virulently anti-gay including an article titled quote

1013
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
6 great immigrants

1014
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
Wow

1015
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
That's,

1016
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,215
That is somebody should have just been like guys

1017
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Let's just

1018
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,055
With this is even worse

1019
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:18,943
We know what we're doing being like yeah guess what we're evil

1020
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
That boy

1021
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:26,623
Understand to the society and their Publications

1022
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Venus conspiracy

1023
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:33,023
They treated the push to end apartheid in South Africa and Rhodesia is communist conspiracy

1024
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,863
They treat any instance of people who aren't white men demanding rights

1025
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
As a communist

1026
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
Conspiracy

1027
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,239
And this is the intellectual tradition that Alex filters the world through

1028
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
It's not racism it's just they don't like communism

1029
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
Absolute loser

1030
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,175
This is where it all started for him

1031
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,199
John birdshit

1032
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,527
It does it seems weird to me

1033
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,343
That you can just get away with the same

1034
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
Way of

1035
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
Pretending not to be racist

1036
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
For so long

1037
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,231
You know like The Birches have been around being racist

1038
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:07,071
Since people were allowed to just throw the n-word around 4

1039
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
But I know

1040
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
Because they were so

1041
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,007
Reviled and no one like them that they disappeared for a long

1042
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Stretch

1043
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,079
And people forgot that there

1044
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
F****** idiots

1045
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
Alright

1046
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
Brutal brutal

1047
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
So

1048
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Alex

1049
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
Life is so stupid

1050
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
George Orwell

1051
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Interesting

1052
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
Interesting start

1053
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
Real

1054
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,255
Waze and how they plan to only hurt

1055
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,047
Interesting start

1056
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,351
Dominus of the Spanish Civil War

1057
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,191
20 years of working with the comments to the highest levels

1058
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
Intelligence

1059
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
Uninstalling

1060
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
Before WWII

1061
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Oh

1062
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
Long-term plan

1063
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
Call Schwalbe distillate

1064
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Frontman of

1065
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,767
No scrub

1066
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,839
Twin story about George Orwell but that Alex is making that s*** up

1067
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,935
Also the Davis Group isn't the thing and class Schwab didn't just get made ahead of it

1068
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,263
Davos is the name of the meeting of the world economic forum

1069
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,335
Founded in 1971

1070
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Started it

1071
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,503
Alex has just recently learned about him named Alex

1072
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,367
Learned his name recently need a name whenever he was founding it

1073
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,391
But now that they

1074
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
They've been found

1075
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
They got a name

1076
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,743
Alex's yelled about the Davos group for

1077
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,351
F****** ever and never appeared on his website until

1078
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Very recently

1079
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
You never would talk

1080
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,703
It's not a name of any of his villains

1081
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,495
No such b*******

1082
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,567
We've traveled through twenty-odd years of his past

1083
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:58,687
At this point and I have yet to hear him say close Schwab is also the originator behind all of this neck

1084
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
Text Bill Gates in

1085
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,783
The world economic forum

1086
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
No real

1087
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:09,439
Interest in the who the people in it are specific about stuff

1088
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,511
It's not really all that effective and people kind of geek

1089
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
Confused and lost in the details but if you say something

1090
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:21,215
Like Davos group your mind can go to a smoky boardroom of

1091
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Decisions

1092
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
And if you name one name too many times then that person

1093
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,591
Quit then you have 2 minutes news

1094
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,663
They replaced

1095
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
Them being

1096
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,735
The narrative

1097
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,575
George Orwell Story made up

1098
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,135
Also terrible news coming out of the UK

1099
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Prince Charles

1100
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,255
Four months ago to a worldwide war against humanity

1101
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
Pretty population

1102
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
Worldwide collapse

1103
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,215
How he

1104
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,239
Fell down

1105
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,543
When he went up to the podium he fell

1106
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
On his face

1107
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
Haha

1108
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:05,247
Obviously Prince Charles did not pledge himself to a war against humanity

1109
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:11,647
Winifer the power of Satan helping Smite his enemies but probably not going to be king

1110
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:17,023
Even if he is he won't be for long to cares

1111
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,327
F*** around and outlive him but you know

1112
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
Then again this morning

1113
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
When were recording this we did learn that

1114
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
The queen has covid

1115
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
So kudos

1116
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,847
Also the monarchy is mostly symbolic and ceremonial get into that one pretty hard I don't care if the

1117
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,175
The prince says that he's going to demand a World War because again

1118
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:38,015
Not actually be bad.

1119
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
But like

1120
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,135
Imagining a scenario

1121
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,463
We're Prince Charles has called for a war against humanity

1122
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:53,119
Him being king or not would have no effect on his ability to pull that off

1123
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:59,519
Feel better than the British because they would have to seriously reevaluate their relationship with the monarchy

1124
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
Prince Charles that much

1125
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:06,687
Much lower than Elizabeth

1126
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711
Think that's

1127
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,735
There was

1128
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
Large

1129
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
Part of the

1130
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:14,111
The public will be far more interested in William

1131
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
Skip

1132
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,743
Just get rid of them

1133
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,047
Yeah come on

1134
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,607
See serious public pressure for him to abdicate

1135
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,679
If if you were to assign

1136
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:33,567
Even in his interest to be king for a short. Of time

1137
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:39,967
Be in turmoil with people don't like him

1138
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,247
Intuit nobody wants him to

1139
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,599
Run the risk of losing

1140
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,903
Which amazingly you still have

1141
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:54,559
So yeah we have some more thoughts about Prince Charles here Alex's soda rambling about to how he's going to

1142
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,351
Destroy Prince Charles in

1143
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,655
Achoo

1144
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
We were checked you

1145
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,263
Because we hate you

1146
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,311
We fight you because we love our children

1147
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,847
Innocent

1148
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
With God's

1149
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,223
You will not break us

1150
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
We will

1151
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
Break you

1152
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Situation

1153
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
With Russia

1154
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
What

1155
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
I'm sorry what

1156
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Hold up

1157
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,471
Hold up

1158
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
So there you go they kept yelling Awards coming

1159
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
Horseshit is

1160
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,647
So this is how Alex reports the news but what actually happened is that bike came out and said that he was convinced the Putin

1161
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,927
Decided to invade Ukraine

1162
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,279
He never said that he was reiterating that the US was going to attack Russia and its

1163
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,607
Almost all of this comments have been about how we're not going to do that

1164
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,935
On Friday he even said quote make no mistake

1165
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:09,055
Is Russia pursues its plans it will be responsible for a catastrophic in needless war of choice

1166
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,359
The United States and our allies are prepared

1167
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,663
To defend every inch of NATO territory from

1168
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,223
Any threat to our collective security as well

1169
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,551
We also will not send troops to fight in Ukraine

1170
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,599
But we will continue to support the Ukrainian

1171
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:28,511
He was literally saying the opposite of what Alex is reporting and to just said that he would impose sanctions

1172
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
Russia decided to invade

1173
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:35,167
The reason that there is a disconnect here is likely because Alex is getting all of his information

1174
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,727
Really disreputable pro-putin Outlets

1175
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
But share his outlook on the

1176
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
That would make

1177
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,615
I would think that's what's going on

1178
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
And I'm I'm not like

1179
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,735
So far outside of the media sphere that I'm unconnected

1180
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,271
But I have not heard

1181
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Anyone

1182
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
Calling for asthma

1183
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,623
The cleansing of Russia I have just not heard it from

1184
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
Anyone

1185
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
So there's that

1186
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,951
There's something going on

1187
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
Here and that is that

1188
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
The globalist

1189
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,071
They want Russia back

1190
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,215
And so here's Alex talking about that

1191
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,239
Good kind of disgusting

1192
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
Lovelace of lost Russia

1193
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
I want to retake

1194
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,151
485 years ago

1195
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
The children in

1196
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
Puppy monkey logic

1197
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,991
Live torture

1198
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
Now they know that

1199
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,575
Catalyst there now they Brothers

1200
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
Metro Police

1201
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,879
Another you in

1202
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,927
You want everywhere that go rape and murder

1203
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
The c-130s landed in country

1204
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Europe

1205
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,631
They go to the hungry arms

1206
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Schwab

1207
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
Acs's lower

1208
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
The worms

1209
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
We are

1210
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
Meat on the table

1211
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Season 4 the monsters they are

1212
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,391
Block find God again

1213
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
Preferred

1214
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
I will not be

1215
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,719
Your slave I will not

1216
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
Conventional

1217
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,279
Because we want wake up

1218
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
To the facts

1219
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Medaryville

1220
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
He won't take the black

1221
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631
Realize

1222
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
Finger bad

1223
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
What that app

1224
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
You wake up

1225
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:23,199
Tell that Alex is actually using terms like blackpill on air

1226
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Yeah that's

1227
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
That's

1228
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
That's just

1229
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,295
That's if that's what the

1230
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
The pillows

1231
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
That's part of it

1232
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:35,487
Let's the big Awakening and realize

1233
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
Conversely the back

1234
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
F****** nihilism

1235
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,143
It's been that has a specific meaning and

1236
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,727
I know that is that the world is to screw to be saved or chain

1237
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,311
And it was particularly popular among incel community

1238
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,663
Take the black pill for them at realizing there's no chance of their circumstance

1239
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
Hopeless

1240
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,759
Which had the effect of leading some to commit

1241
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,039
Act of mass murder

1242
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,855
In the political context taking the black pill is a root

1243
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
To domestic Terror

1244
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:03,903
That's

1245
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
What is being promoted

1246
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,839
Also a lot of especially the meat on the table stuff that Alex is doing that's just in referencing

1247
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,375
Fake documents silent weapons

1248
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,399
For quiet Wars

1249
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,495
It was a hoax document that Bill Cooper published and build apparel

1250
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
And Alex thinks it's real

1251
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:25,663
But Alex is encouraging his audience

1252
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,503
Is a really dangerous kind of combination

1253
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Stop yeah

1254
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
It's gross

1255
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:37,183
People's emotional heartstrings with these planes and take your kids

1256
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
Prakash Rob 22

1257
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Dassault

1258
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
It's just f***** up

1259
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
I mean it is

1260
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
It is like

1261
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,887
We just watch these motherfuker

1262
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Kill

1263
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
Hundreds of thousands

1264
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,263
Through

1265
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,079
Lies b******* and inaction and

1266
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,871
F****** exacerbating things

1267
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,663
With the worst action that you can do

1268
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,479
And rather than face any consequences for that

1269
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:04,319
They just get to smooth ride on over into trying to get p

1270
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,343
People killed with guns

1271
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
Instead of disease

1272
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,671
And that's just how it's allowed to have

1273
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
Cool

1274
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:18,399
Alex has some fake things to say about the president

1275
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
Mexico

1276
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:23,775
I've heard from him in a while this is such a bizarre thing for Alex to say

1277
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,079
Mexico's got his problems but

1278
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,871
Likes to be its own country and sovereign

1279
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,623
The Mexican socialist president

1280
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
Along with it

1281
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:45,023
We don't want the great reset here we don't

1282
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,303
We don't want to build back better

1283
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Besides that

1284
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
He's not

1285
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
So this is a direct contradiction

1286
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,495
So many narratives about immigration that Alex has spread over the years

1287
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,799
If you're one of his listeners and you

1288
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:00,639
Hear that that Mexico does its own thing it isn't involved with the globalists

1289
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:07,039
That should be a cold splash of water across your face that Alex is making everything off trying to work with the global

1290
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:13,439
Was to take back Texas this whole time or whatever.

1291
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,255
In the game of 2018

1292
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:20,095
Also you didn't see those things on the news that I was talking to cuz it didn't happen

1293
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:26,495
Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez obrador has been vaccinated and boosted although he has

1294
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,287
Lockdown measures taken by other countries

1295
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
But you have

1296
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,871
Cenotes being clearly excessive

1297
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
FairPoint

1298
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,223
He's also gotten covid twice so maybe some measures might be wise

1299
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
I can find no evidence that he said those things about the great reset or build back better which I don't even think things that Alex

1300
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:49,535
Define with this point Nancy Pelosi stop the build back better legislation from

1301
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
Headed back to college

1302
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:56,959
What why are they batted what are these things like what does it mean

1303
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
It's it's

1304
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,055
Whenever everybody's at all white and then they're not

1305
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:05,407
What is build back better

1306
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:11,807
Really weird Alex aclib strange thoughts about to the president

1307
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,623
He's going to say something

1308
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
Things about Clash Royale

1309
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,695
And the deputy

1310
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Prime minister

1311
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,327
In Europe is becoming a failed system

1312
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
What is Pop-Pop say

1313
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,423
We're creating a post-industrial world

1314
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,519
We're getting rid of the social contract we're getting rid of

1315
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
We are going to build

1316
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
Collapsing under cloward-piven

1317
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
These are freaking statements out of

1318
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,015
Father was

1319
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
The fourth-largest

1320
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Manager

1321
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
What

1322
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Christina Freeman's

1323
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,487
Father was the director

1324
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,863
Joseph Goebbels

1325
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
Multiple

1326
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,519
Of course she works

1327
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Klaus Schwab

1328
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:11,199
You can hear the way that Alex was like grasping at things trying to pull details now

1329
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:17,343
When is the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada become a bit of a target for the truck Convoy supporters

1330
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,927
Sushi is it is getting it on the act of attack

1331
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:26,303
See how Alex is remembering something trying to smear Freeland but

1332
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Quite remember what

1333
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,375
You supposed to be mad about

1334
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,959
So freeland's father Donald Freeland was a farmer in Alberta

1335
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:36,799
Beats of Rage it seems unlikely that our father would have been old enough to be gribbles

1336
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
Right hand man

1337
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,615
Are you sure I'm positive how old is

1338
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,687
She I don't know but that doesn't match up

1339
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Her mother was named

1340
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:48,319
Hell yeah.

1341
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,159
She was born in 1946 though so I don't think she was involved

1342
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,439
Hitler's war effort

1343
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,999
Her father me Kayla Chung

1344
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,327
Was the editor-in-chief of an anti-semitic publication

1345
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
Tim called Krakow Avenue

1346
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,191
That was distributed around Nazi occupied territory

1347
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,055
So one of the things that's really interesting about this story is that it seems like he acts descendants

1348
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,615
I've done a lot of wrestling with what this guy did

1349
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:16,223
For instance Freeman's Uncle history professor John Paul hemka

1350
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,039
Has written published articles about his father-in-law's connection with

1351
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
With the paper

1352
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,343
Freeland has even cried it is

1353
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,623
Assisting in one of them

1354
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:29,279
A person isn't inherently responsible for the things that their parents or grandparents did particularly when they make an effort to learn from

1355
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,047
Bad history

1356
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,631
I don't feel like the grandchildren of Nazis need to be condemned for the action

1357
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,167
Is there grandparents unless they're Nazis

1358
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Themselves

1359
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
To suggest

1360
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Freeland

1361
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
I don't think

1362
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
This is going to work

1363
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Yeah

1364
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:46,175
A class Rob his father worked at a plant called Usher wife

1365
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
AG

1366
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,991
Which mostly made turbine

1367
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,343
They did Supply the Nazis during the war but they weren't their top weapons

1368
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,903
Supplier fourth top arms whatever

1369
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,719
All those family repatriated to Switzerland during

1370
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767
I mean

1371
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,559
Yeah if you're is it at mean it's like

1372
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:08,959
What are we going to be mad at like Volkswagen or something for helping the Nazis maybe the business itself with someone

1373
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:14,335
I would wonder about the level of their culpability

1374
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
Fled the country

1375
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,663
During the war

1376
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:22,271
Cuz they possibly they have less culpability Alex is trying to acai

1377
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
For sure

1378
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,367
Yeah it is it would be an interesting like

1379
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
It like

1380
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,695
Down the line employees

1381
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,487
I'm not saying this is a good idea but like

1382
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:38,143
1938 Ford and 1938 Volkswagen who's more anti-semetic you know what I'm saying

1383
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
I'm like that's a good question

1384
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,239
Sure it's not a good question it's a bad question but it's men

1385
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,823
Legacy of the cereal about it

1386
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:54,015
Game to exaggerate all this stuff and grasp

1387
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Put straws to attack you

1388
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:55,807
Supposed

1389
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,391
He's only doing that because the alternative is working hard

1390
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
Do that

1391
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,815
He's going to Lazy rude and he can't even get the details of the lazy route right

1392
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
He's talkin about Freeland

1393
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,191
Has grandfather got those

1394
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,983
Words can't even remember the details of

1395
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
What each one did

1396
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
It's on it's worth

1397
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
So weird

1398
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:22,431
It's so weird because if I knew that my words and actions and deeds could

1399
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Potentially get somebody

1400
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,271
I would be far more specific

1401
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,415
Responsibility to I would like to know details before I just said hey

1402
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,719
To all of my millions of murder targets

1403
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:38,303
What is 1 when you're talking about stuff like these I do believe

1404
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,375
That you have a higher level of responsibility than

1405
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
Someone talking s***

1406
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,191
Alex's

1407
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,263
Demonstrated pretty clearly that

1408
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,127
Keys on Russia's iodine no matter what they do is there in the right

1409
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,919
Visa Vie Ukraine on the Dunbar

1410
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
To the point of

1411
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
Claiming a fictitious genocide

1412
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:01,087
In 2014 he was on board with

1413
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,879
Their annexation of Crimea

1414
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,927
Perfectly similar reason

1415
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,975
Browse this this was trouble

1416
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,047
So now we know it's a western offensive in the Ukraine

1417
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,375
Trying to elicit a response

1418
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,471
Georgia

1419
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
That seems to be a little bit

1420
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
Weird

1421
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,639
I mean

1422
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
That's not good

1423
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,783
Yeah it's it seems to be just like a really consistent thing he's just

1424
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,855
Like if you think that Russia was the good guys

1425
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,647
In 2008

1426
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Yeah that you're gone

1427
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:47,935
I'll be missing so weird to meet like I can understand people taking the the anti-nato side

1428
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:53,055
I'd have liked or you guys shouldn't have said in the 90s or whatever you're not going to try and expand and then

1429
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:58,943
Now Ukraine starting to talk and then I get why Russia is it because Russia has to have a response I can't just have no root

1430
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,295
Otherwise they basically seating any kind of power in the global stage whatsoever

1431
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,319
But you can't be like

1432
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,111
Russia's telling the truth

1433
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
No

1434
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,671
No no no no no nothing nothing

1435
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,023
And Western aggression force them

1436
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,583
Go to Warriors Georgia

1437
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:20,447
It's the little we can do a lot of s*** but that is too far it's a little much yeah

1438
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,775
So Alex pawlowski

1439
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,335
Come on the show and talk about how

1440
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,895
View

1441
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,223
This this this this truck my ears is weird

1442
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,319
And it's just amazing under the civil emergency to hold your father

1443
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
Until March 11th

1444
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,695
Without bail without bond

1445
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
Perfect Crime

1446
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,375
Godfather conscience

1447
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
Black people

1448
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,519
Say no to being told that it's in the back of the bus

1449
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
Restaurant Norfolk

1450
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,639
Window in

1451
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,711
Get it out

1452
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,807
I know you can't come on the bus

1453
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
.

1454
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,927
Black folks around the us at see that

1455
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:15,487
There's a Man Group

1456
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Refusing to take

1457
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
You can handle a four-way all the

1458
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:29,055
Solve this by reminding Alex that his intellectual tradition that he belongs to and all of his Heroes were the ones fighting super aggressive

1459
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
Allow businesses

1460
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
Get food from those back windows

1461
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:39,039
But he still forced he still fighting hard to get Banks to be fine not giving black people own

1462
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
What is

1463
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,463
Superheroes in the John Birch Society and people like Gary Allan wrote and pamphlets about how the sit-ins at lunch

1464
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,767
Doubters where nefarious communist conspiracy

1465
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:52,351
Let's overthrow the country's the fuk down with his lionizing

1466
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,631
Civil Rights Movement

1467
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:58,495
If you been around back then he would have been bull horning City into another funded by

1468
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,287
The Rothschilds are some

1469
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,919
All the larger level the situation with vaccinated as literally no similarity to the treatment of black people in America

1470
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:10,015
The suggestion is offensive on its face

1471
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,343
His brain and his desire to aggrandize his own imagine suffering

1472
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,903
12 minimizing the legitimate struggle faced by people who died

1473
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
Don't look like

1474
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:23,327
I would encourage him to provide literally any examples of people who been arrested for not getting vaccinated and then after that he condemned

1475
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,119
Majority of them are black

1476
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:28,703
As far as I know and can tell no one has been arrested for not getting vaccinated

1477
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,751
Some people have been arrested for refusing to

1478
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:34,335
Places that require vaccinations after they've been asked to leave but

1479
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,383
How it should be in favor of that since

1480
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,455
Those businesses and their owners should have the right of free association

1481
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
Deserve whatever customers they want

1482
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,575
Your call Alex was super in favor of that Bakery not making

1483
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,855
Can a gay couple of wedding cake

1484
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:49,695
You've also been arrested for having Thor Distributing

1485
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,743
Fake vaccination cards which is just

1486
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,279
Forgery of official document

1487
01:09:54,047 --> 01:10:00,191
Call what fraud the crime now are we just going to say that I guess it is

1488
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,495
But now we're going to cry

1489
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:07,871
And this is actually one of the ways I think I think you can see here that Alex waste everyone's f****** time

1490
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,943
Because he's making these declarative statements

1491
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:17,343
People are getting arrested for not getting vaccinated a majority of them are black

1492
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
You go and find

1493
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:25,791
At the wild goose chase that you aren't going end up going on if you are expected to

1494
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
Assess

1495
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,119
The information that Alex is providing right and it's

1496
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,399
The Trap

1497
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:33,215
The time-wasting Trap and he does potentially

1498
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:37,311
I'm not letting at least of which that you're not just going to blanket search

1499
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
4

1500
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,407
Vax unrecognized people arrested you're going to search for like

1501
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:48,319
Black unvaccinated people arrested he's he's narrowed the search down so you won't even try and look for a broader

1502
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:57,023
People who are arrested for not giving cash

1503
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,071
Not

1504
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
Yes no

1505
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,423
So we're one more clip from Pulaski's son

1506
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,311
Happened to the notion innocent until proven guilty

1507
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
What happened to Dupree

1508
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Or something

1509
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:18,015
He's not been convicted of

1510
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,319
And don't let him out on bail that's that's martial law

1511
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,367
Yeah exactly

1512
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:27,999
No now so the courts in Canada are not presuming pawlowski guilty of the offense that he was arrested for

1513
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:32,607
They used to pass pattern of behavior to decide that he was a person with a high likelihood

1514
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,191
The certainty of reoffending If released that's not

1515
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,495
That's not presuming him guilty

1516
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,031
Forgot

1517
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Innocent

1518
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,639
Being a consistent nuisance

1519
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
To society

1520
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,479
Until he was then convicted guilty of being a

1521
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,319
To society and then later on whenever you get caught up again

1522
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,111
They're like you're a consistent Newsome

1523
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
We already proved it Nobel

1524
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,207
And he's also getting his due process rights

1525
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:04,607
It's like he has News full trial yet but they didn't just say no bail for you and slam the door in his face

1526
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Hearing

1527
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:12,031
Don said the total b******* and saying any idea what martial law actually means

1528
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,847
1 + 4 what about that I mean

1529
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,687
Me I get the feeling that Alex's understanding of what martial law is coming

1530
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,247
Mostly from like dystopian movies

1531
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
The last duel

1532
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,623
As I passed martial law

1533
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,951
Not a dystopian movie it's a Ridley Scott his

1534
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,999
History movie about two nights

1535
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,303
It's dystopian inasmuch as

1536
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,143
It's like we're both in it

1537
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
Is it good

1538
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:45,311
I know that cuz it looked at the Wikipedia page earlier I will be honest like most Ridley Scott historical Epic

1539
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,895
Very long bike alien no like a kingdom of heaven

1540
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:53,503
Kingdom of heaven and a half hours

1541
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,551
Stillgoode

1542
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,343
Actually really liked it but too long

1543
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
I'm happy for you

1544
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,159
We all like what we like

1545
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,183
Something I don't like

1546
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:07,071
Like the last duel sure I guess we'll have I have one I have I don't like that movie

1547
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,423
I don't like is Alex's next Gaston without a hole

1548
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
Only reason we're still alive on air and only reason we are millions and millions of them

1549
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,639
Tropical watch Justin am and FM station

1550
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,223
It's because of you

1551
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,807
What am I told you

1552
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,111
World governments making its move

1553
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,927
Strengths about a weakness

1554
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Now that the

1555
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,279
Thermonuclear war

1556
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,559
Two Minutes to Midnight

1557
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,191
The most prolific individual D Trailblazer

1558
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
The most accurate person

1559
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Really see the

1560
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,311
Stickers everywhere

1561
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,359
Jones was right well

1562
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
David

1563
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
What's right first

1564
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,431
The term deposits

1565
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,735
Weather for the next day

1566
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,087
78

1567
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,903
That's honestly degrading for Alex do we sing

1568
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:10,303
Complete loser putting himself second to David Icke of all peoples

1569
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,863
I get the sense that Alex is doing this in order to

1570
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,959
Create the false appearance that he and David Icke were on the same page early on

1571
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
But that kind of winds a bit of

1572
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:24,639
False credibility to the idea that they were both predicting what is happening in the world today you want a unified front or at Leon

1573
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,783
That's absolutely not true and I even a little bit of time engaging with their material knows that

1574
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,367
You know the thing that's absolutely pathetic about this is that

1575
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
Very clear

1576
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,207
Power imbalance that is totally clear but

1577
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,487
Entirely unspoken

1578
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,327
PeopleLink existir the guy who hasn't changed his core branding

1579
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
The same isn't true for Alex

1580
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,167
David Icke early in his

1581
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,215
His career

1582
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:53,567
Pretty much all of Ike's worldview in order to keep up with the rapidly escalating insanity

1583
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,359
Findlay conspiracy community

1584
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:59,711
Do you like was he turd in the punch bowl with his interdimensional lizard being

1585
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,479
Things back in the day

1586
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,783
To the real s*** talking about the

1587
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,063
Banks of the UN

1588
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:09,951
Alex is always know better than David Icke it's just now realizes he's not capable of maintaining a brand

1589
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
Pretend that he is

1590
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
Pictures of crazy as he's ever been

1591
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,071
His brain isn't

1592
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,375
Entirely able to take or leave Alex

1593
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
He won

1594
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,751
Hanesbrands is f****** impenetrable at this point

1595
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:29,151
He's made enough of a cottage industry for himself a really really need anybody else he can help us out loud weird speaking

1596
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,175
Can you date Alexa

1597
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,199
Sell books

1598
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:35,295
He's a little bit like a passive cult leader like he doesn't have to have those like

1599
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,367
He doesn't tell you to go get him s*** all the time but

1600
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,183
You'll just show up and people be like oh my God you're amazing

1601
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,535
She made a name for himself

1602
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,071
Bank

1603
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,399
Completely crazy at a time when there were enough

1604
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,935
Public crazy figures

1605
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,263
He was early in on the game he's a grandfather yet

1606
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:59,359
Famous person prior to that like

1607
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,943
Went he went on TV and said he was the son of God

1608
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,735
Like it was

1609
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
Ridiculously

1610
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
Huge

1611
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,879
Coming from that kind of an inciting incident

1612
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,183
Into this career in like

1613
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,975
Lizards Walk Among Us

1614
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,743
Like

1615
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:20,863
There's a built-in thing that will allow you to have like

1616
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
F*** off

1617
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,447
Kind of money in your branch

1618
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,263
You know he has he has his own thing and

1619
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,103
Alex's Alex's so pathetic that you just have to be

1620
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,687
He can't stick to his guns now because there's no money

1621
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
And being like

1622
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Haha yeah

1623
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,551
Everyone else

1624
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,111
Is getting sucked into qanon stuff

1625
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,463
Everyone else is getting sucked into these inter-dimensional demons and what-have-you in

1626
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:51,839
I want to hold the line and tell you about how great Rand Paul's physical

1627
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:58,239
Ideas are you know what we need to reduce foreign aid while we're on the subject let's get rid of

1628
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,799
Let's let's

1629
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,615
The FED will get people excited

1630
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:07,199
Don't be lizards

1631
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,759
So that Alex has had to

1632
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:13,087
Completely sacrifice whatever are of

1633
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,391
Like I'm better than that he want

1634
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,439
That there that's a sort of facade

1635
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,999
And what's left is David Icke laughing

1636
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,023
Except he's not

1637
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,815
Cuz I don't think they would I give

1638
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,863
Yeah I don't know what

1639
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
I don't know what

1640
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
Drives that guy

1641
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
That's it that's

1642
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,471
That's something I don't want to

1643
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:33,311
I think it's actually he's mentally unwell

1644
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,359
Is that can't just be it people wouldn't

1645
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:41,503
Engage in a decades-long labeling of

1646
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,039
Oh wait no yeah they would

1647
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:47,135
I don't know exactly what it is but there's something

1648
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:47,903
I think

1649
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
80s prom

1650
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,023
Also is Alix lynx

1651
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,655
Unfortunately that's basically him saying that he believes the protocols of the Elders of Zion are real because David Icke has

1652
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,935
Push that quite a bit

1653
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,727
So congratulations Alex

1654
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,775
Anyway

1655
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,567
He's into these trackers

1656
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,383
He likes that he likes the Canadian protest

1657
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,039
Is 2

1658
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,623
Purchase the biggest Reservoir

1659
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,487
The threat of a good example

1660
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
If

1661
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
You

1662
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,607
Do what they done

1663
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,191
Canadian

1664
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,223
Pressure and oldest

1665
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,783
They say okay well

1666
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
Massive state

1667
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,767
Show the rest of the world

1668
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,863
People have the power

1669
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,679
This isn't the legitimate powers of people situation

1670
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:07,519
Prove that a relatively small number of people who act

1671
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,799
Strategically can on

1672
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:13,407
Unsuccessfully attempt to force their will on a much larger population who doesn't support them

1673
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,687
If they're willing to take

1674
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,967
Extreme Measures

1675
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:22,623
Outcome of it will be annoying a ton of people and wasting everyone's time for a while

1676
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,671
Prove the efficacy of

1677
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
Terrorism

1678
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,231
So congratulations on that

1679
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
I guess

1680
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:31,839
Great that's not power the people that's the opposite want to

1681
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,631
Terrorize people

1682
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,703
Into giving up on what they believe is right

1683
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:43,103
Andover throwing this is their of their elected leader because

1684
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
Right

1685
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
These people are stupid

1686
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,711
Anyway they want

1687
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,271
It is so funny to me that the people who

1688
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:54,367
Screamed at me after 9/11 about how patriotism is so important

1689
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
Are f****** terrorist now

1690
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
Well

1691
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,255
To be fair

1692
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:05,375
Astra Alex would not have been yelling at my patriotism in the aftermath of 9/11

1693
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,935
Other people

1694
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
Probably

1695
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
These days

1696
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
Alex David Icke

1697
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,592
They I think are invested in

1698
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,616
Trying to read

1699
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
The situation in Canada

1700
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
What happens if

1701
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,504
Millions of Canadians images

1702
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,784
Marched peacefully now

1703
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,112
Would that finally break the will of the steering is that the answer

1704
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,672
That's why

1705
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
You know

1706
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,096
People in Canada robot looking from the sidelines

1707
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
Buffy you doing

1708
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:45,824
What's your say is not just your future

1709
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:49,664
Disappearing into a fascist tyranny

1710
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,928
Silence and David want tons of people to show up and represent the solution to world

1711
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:07,072
They're disappointed that the protests are getting cleared without any real major incident happening that they can profit from exploding

1712
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:11,168
Alex didn't get that false flag car bomb that he was hoping for so

1713
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,472
He's home to try to do the best you can with

1714
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,008
Another completely false

1715
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,592
Pretty underwhelming narrative about organizers getting arrested without charges

1716
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:23,712
That's not exciting and also if anyone takes the time to look into it they just see that

1717
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
Just making it up

1718
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:30,368
The answer to this propaganda narrative dead-end that they're facing is the prospect of adding more fuel to the

1719
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,392
The fire in the form of

1720
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,184
Tons of people showing up energized

1721
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,208
I'm convinced that

1722
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,768
Stopping the clearing to the protest is the solution to

1723
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
World tyranny being established

1724
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:43,936
High probability of causing some kind of a flare-up which is what these dudes want

1725
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,776
This isn't going to happen because I doubt there are millions of people in Canada

1726
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
Support the protest

1727
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:53,152
Apple came out on the 14th showing at 72% of Canadians wanted

1728
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,432
The protesters to quote

1729
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,712
Go home now

1730
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:02,368
44% of the said the protests inclined to support measures like indoor masking

1731
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,440
And showing proof of vaccinations at the Canada u.s. border so

1732
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:08,256
Substance you could look at the protesters being counterproductive

1733
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,048
Maybe they backfired

1734
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
I don't know

1735
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,888
And it certainly didn't achieve whatever goals they wanted to enlist

1736
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,912
The goals were

1737
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:18,240
Enrichment of some really shity grifters

1738
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,288
The ton of attention for some

1739
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,592
Some shady folks

1740
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,920
Yeah I mean I think we're missing out on another huge

1741
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Which crucial ask

1742
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
Aspect of this is that

1743
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,760
This is all happening where it

1744
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,320
Can't really affect Alex or David at all

1745
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
So they get to

1746
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,648
The pride and power of saying

1747
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:38,464
You guys go shut down this whole place with knowing

1748
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,512
Expect nothing bad will happen to them

1749
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,792
Probably not

1750
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,864
I mean the only real possibility

1751
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,424
Is if those blockades wife

1752
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,192
Rested long enough

1753
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,728
Have a severe impact

1754
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,544
On goods and services flow

1755
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,360
Did the tractor supply chain in some way

1756
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,176
If it ended up reaching the situation where

1757
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,200
The

1758
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,016
This artist migrated to the United States

1759
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,552
Right and

1760
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,344
Going to major thoroughfares in

1761
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,136
Primetime trade route

1762
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:07,904
Square block

1763
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,744
You could see Alex getting affected but I don't think even he thinks

1764
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,024
Said it would ever get to that point

1765
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,608
I mean I think the queen will have to of course just take

1766
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
Canada back

1767
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
That'll be the first thing

1768
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,192
The illusion

1769
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,240
That she's not in charge

1770
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
Let you know

1771
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,080
I mean if they want to get rid of Trudeau there's only one way to do it

1772
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,104
Not give it back to the queen

1773
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,408
Well see but that's why Trudeau gave the queen covid

1774
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:33,248
Trudeau you clever bastard I've read your book

1775
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,552
Always one step ahead

1776
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,320
Trudeau

1777
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:41,440
So I just want to try and scare people until like you need to go and

1778
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,464
Stop the

1779
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,512
Stopping over primary

1780
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
What we are on

1781
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:49,120
Looking at now it's decision time

1782
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,936
You know all we going to

1783
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,240
Capitulate

1784
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,824
Location

1785
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,360
Ongoing future

1786
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:00,896
Emoji

1787
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,200
Which what you're saying on the screen

1788
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
Is the norm

1789
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,088
A Line in the Sand

1790
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:09,856
Because

1791
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,160
So many times

1792
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:15,488
What is coming what is plan

1793
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,816
East Falls

1794
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,400
Extreme

1795
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,312
In terms of the consequences of standing up now

1796
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,360
When people say

1797
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,944
Oh yeah but what are the consequences for me of doing this

1798
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:38,784
I can tell you the consequences of not doing it

1799
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,600
Enormously greater

1800
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
Psych

1801
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,928
I guess you should at all costs

1802
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,952
Penzeys fruit

1803
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,512
I mean yeah you have to be willing to give up your life

1804
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:51,328
At the border of Canada and

1805
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
America

1806
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,632
And Ottawa

1807
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,936
To get people to stop

1808
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
To get

1809
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,056
To get the thing that they want witches

1810
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,872
To really achieve that

1811
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:11,808
So he's speaking pretty passionately about how like it's nightmarish whatever is going to happen is is so much worse

1812
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,600
Worse than you could possibly even imagine

1813
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,904
This happens is really really funny

1814
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,936
Why are you crying why are you crying

1815
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:30,240
Well

1816
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:45,344
Would you like me to write alright crazy like okay thanks for that

1817
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,392
That's so great

1818
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,464
Alex trying to like really like I asked

1819
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,536
You crying what's going on here

1820
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,816
I'll cry

1821
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,632
Thought about you idiot for free

1822
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:03,520
One of my favorite genres of Alex question

1823
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,800
Question

1824
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,592
To subtly and play Alex

1825
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,384
Along the way

1826
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,664
It's just gorgeous

1827
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
What is it like

1828
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
For you

1829
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,064
Tell me what about the world what's happening currently produced you

1830
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,624
As such an iconic person

1831
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,696
Super iconic who is out there

1832
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Globalist

1833
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,816
Preeminence

1834
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,400
Can't believe it

1835
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,192
But what is it like

1836
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,800
Years or so you bump

1837
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,848
Thirtysomething

1838
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,528
Play David David

1839
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,576
We're both you

1840
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,136
We're both so big I love you but mimos

1841
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,160
I like meat

1842
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,488
And I'm bigger than you I'm just saying that the two names

1843
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,768
Are you and me

1844
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:03,168
And me as first rarefied air

1845
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:05,984
With me in this rarefied air of you and me

1846
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,032
I do love that but that's a lot of fun

1847
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
That's so annoying

1848
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,848
So you like

1849
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:14,944
Just talking about Satan a Feeling

1850
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,480
About Satan

1851
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,760
Being fear

1852
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,624
This Consciousness this would Tycho this

1853
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,392
Satan

1854
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,072
Because it's fear

1855
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:31,840
Feed store

1856
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,608
Sphere

1857
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,888
Ice always has to

1858
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,728
Interstates

1859
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,920
Getting the fear

1860
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,904
What we need to do

1861
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,720
Easter Easter rise above that

1862
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,512
Allowed

1863
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,560
Ciara

1864
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:05,888
To impose itself upon us

1865
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
That's so dumb

1866
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:10,240
The only thing we have to fear

1867
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,520
Is the devil

1868
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,640
And what we know about fear

1869
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,480
The mind-killer goddamnit

1870
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,064
Come on man I'm sorry I wasn't ready for a dune ref

1871
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,136
Mine always be prepared

1872
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,440
I think that's stupid

1873
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,488
I think it's

1874
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,536
Sweethearts built on do you like better octave

1875
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,304
Something that is

1876
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,096
Obviously a right but

1877
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,376
The true point which is

1878
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
Interferes

1879
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,424
Not really a product

1880
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,704
Good State of Mind

1881
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Need to be on right

1882
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,264
And you know

1883
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
Combat fears is always

1884
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,360
Usually a positive exercise

1885
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
That's sad

1886
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,248
I'm in Canada and situation in Ukraine

1887
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,272
Arnot

1888
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Just to make

1889
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
David Icke scare

1890
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
There that's not what this is about sure

1891
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:02,208
There are other things going on that are real important

1892
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,488
Yeah

1893
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
Like

1894
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,328
Important than whether or not David Icke is afraid

1895
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,912
Wow that must be pretty serious

1896
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,728
I understand this

1897
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,032
Impulse on the part of conspiracy theorist

1898
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:20,384
We are just trying to make you scared in order to keep you control then what have you

1899
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
Lupine

1900
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:26,272
But also the things that are happening in the world are real

1901
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
I am

1902
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
Good deal with that seems escapists

1903
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,136
Boston Subway

1904
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:35,744
Flip it around if this is like you know the global is Sturgis

1905
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,792
Trying to make you scared about the situation

1906
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,328
What are you doing

1907
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,704
But you're also trying to make your audience scared

1908
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,264
Well if I'm shaking a they better be

1909
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,616
Global strategy or whatever is the game control by

1910
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,152
Spreading fear

1911
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,456
For that great to keep

1912
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
Control if you're riding

1913
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:00,832
Do I need to control my audience

1914
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
Beer

1915
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:08,768
I'm starting to see why you think that this is bad

1916
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
Go for it

1917
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
Okay

1918
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,912
I'm scary David Icke

1919
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
Is a prop

1920
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,544
That hurts

1921
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,312
Yeah

1922
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,408
What comes next

1923
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
Well

1924
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,784
I have this phrase

1925
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,832
Know the outcome

1926
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,136
Crepe erase

1927
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,000
Global control

1928
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:47,680
Connection of human

1929
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:51,264
It's not going away

1930
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,848
Is

1931
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:01,504
Oops David I just gave up the game

1932
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,392
Wow imagine and state that he sees things going towards

1933
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:13,792
Plan is to take everything that happens in the world and find ways to explain every event is being part of the planet

1934
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Advancing towards

1935
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,840
That and State

1936
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:20,192
Pretty smart in terms of how to be a really lazy profit because he

1937
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,240
Committing to any specific things happening

1938
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:28,640
Unless you're not really ever at risk people saying you're wrong unless you're in state fails to ever come into being

1939
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:35,296
You can always say that the villains are still working towards that end State and their plans are behind maybe like 10 years behind

1940
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,088
As we've heard Alexei so much

1941
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,880
The best way to get a good profit

1942
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,672
Is he out there is to die before it

1943
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,744
It's fruition you're like nobody's going to be like

1944
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,512
Dude

1945
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,792
F****** John

1946
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,072
There were only

1947
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:51,424
5 seals you said they're going to be seven you dick

1948
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:55,008
If you bought in today would like s*** you might

1949
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:59,872
Hear what he saying as a reasonable response but to me that sounds like a clear admission to David Icke

1950
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,920
Just make stuff up as he's going along

1951
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:08,320
He sees world events and incorporates them into the larger narrative that he has about the world fudging details if he has to

1952
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:13,696
Oversimplifying things when necessary and then just outright ignoring tons of stuff that he can't make fit the mold

1953
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,976
The only real question

1954
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:17,536
Search for me is whether he's aware of what he's doing and he's like

1955
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,816
Conscious conman in this

1956
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:22,912
Murphy's just mentally unwell to the point where this is an unconscious process and how he

1957
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,704
Actually experiences the world

1958
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,752
I'm not sure but I think

1959
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,288
Really really telling

1960
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
Like what's next

1961
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
Let me tell you

1962
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,664
I know the endpoint and I will

1963
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,480
Figure it out along the way

1964
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
That's not

1965
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
That's like

1966
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,600
That's aspirational prophecy

1967
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,648
Like I know where the end is going

1968
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,184
So

1969
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:53,120
What are you talkin about if you know where the end is going method of Storytelling

1970
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
Hey look you know what the

1971
01:32:54,912 --> 01:33:01,056
Conclusion of the story is going to be a man along the way you write how the characters get to that point

1972
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:07,456
That's the problem that's too transparently what's going on

1973
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,272
No

1974
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,832
A back-to-front program

1975
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,624
Whatever

1976
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,928
I like good good stuff babe

1977
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,976
Anyway

1978
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,280
There's that there's a problem

1979
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:23,328
With a lot of the vaccine

1980
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:27,680
Conspiracies that they're going right is that they're not killing everybody

1981
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,216
That is a big issue with the

1982
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,776
When did supposed to kill everybody

1983
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,592
Yeah so David thankfully has a workaround

1984
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,944
What do you from your research No Agenda vaccine so-called

1985
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,112
Doing it in a way

1986
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
X2

1987
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:52,000
Keep the levels of people

1988
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,560
Dying suddenly in these earlier

1989
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,352
In this area.

1990
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,936
211 catastrophic is it is

1991
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:06,848
Keep some kind of lit on it

1992
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,408
Enormous numbers of these files

1993
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,736
All right really just say line solution

1994
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Most of the facts

1995
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,832
Mario

1996
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,112
Such a b*******

1997
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,720
F*** you. That's the way I know but there's no number

1998
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
That idea of like

1999
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:28,352
Well it's still catastrophic but this is

2000
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,400
Dare you tell me

2001
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:35,008
That there's a balance between catastrophic and reasonable

2002
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:39,616
The point is well-taken but you also got to take a look back

2003
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,664
And the listen to that last clip

2004
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,200
And recognize what he's doing

2005
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,760
He has the endpoint

2006
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
But he's rich

2007
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,088
And that is what the vaccines are going to kill everybody

2008
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:55,488
And now there are events that are happening in he's had to write little detailed plans because it didn't kill every

2009
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,256
Buddy quick enough

2010
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:02,400
There or their new details that he needs to incorporate like to rewrite

2011
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:06,752
Solution for most of the vaccines which is the explanation for why

2012
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,800
It's not killing everybody in the way that

2013
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:11,104
Of course I have already said my endpoint

2014
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,872
Sure

2015
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,640
So the endpoint

2016
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:15,712
Is actually correct but most people aren't actually kidding tabaxi

2017
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:20,576
Therefore I am right about an end point where you don't know how we get there

2018
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:26,720
Is that you can always move that in point wherever you wanted to go or you can create a loose like

2019
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,536
Illusions of definitions

2020
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
Absolutely you can read to find things

2021
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,912
Sunway Alex remembers

2022
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,216
I think most vaccines are fake too

2023
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,264
Nice

2024
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,312
Credit I remember you

2025
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:47,200
Most of this is sailing they're only targeting old people in military

2026
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,248
And then now they had major top

2027
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,808
Just go off the government's own data

2028
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,648
And show that they're actually targeting conservative nationalist

2029
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,256
When the poison shots actually were able to map it out

2030
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,072
Gregory said a report on what you said

2031
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,144
A long time ago

2032
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:14,336
What's up Gregory's video when they put it out last month and honestly it was so dumb that I didn't even take the time to

2033
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
Engage with it

2034
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:19,200
I just know that I was bringing it up to the fence of dumb s*** that at that David I can say

2035
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,736
I'll talk about it a little

2036
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,552
January video titled

2037
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:25,344
U.s. government targeted

2038
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,136
States with deadly batches effects

2039
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,720
This report was based on a website that a guy named

2040
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,304
Cooper through together called how bad is my back

2041
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,840
It's like reports

2042
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,864
Michelle how many deaths

2043
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,400
Some side effects are associated with

2044
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,168
Each batch

2045
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:42,240
The vaccine listed by badge number

2046
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:49,152
Information was then taken and interpreted to show that to the most deadly inside

2047
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:53,760
This data is all entirely told from

2048
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:56,576
Not even confirmed these Adverse Events happened

2049
01:36:56,832 --> 01:37:00,672
The data isn't meant to be used that way so right off the bat you can't reach any of the

2050
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,720
The conclusions that Gregory's video does

2051
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,744
From this data set

2052
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,536
Already it is stupid

2053
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,072
But

2054
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,144
Make it even more idiotic when you realize what Vera's data is

2055
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:14,496
It's self-reporting of side effects that may or may not be real

2056
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,824
All this data would actually be showing is that in red States

2057
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,688
There are a higher incidence of self-reporting of side effects that may or may not be real

2058
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,272
And if they are real may or may not be related to the vaccine at all

2059
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:31,136
That kind of makes sense to me giving her largely empty Baxley conservative community

2060
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,416
Becoming the last few years

2061
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:36,512
I can see them having a greater tendency to over report possible side effects

2062
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:40,864
Or for some people to actually be inclined to file. Reports

2063
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:45,984
Used by someone like part of Cooper and then Greg reason then Alex

2064
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,520
Some David Icke to argue the facts

2065
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:52,896
Seems our deadly enemy exotic conservative areas while the rest of the world in the country gets placebos

2066
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:59,296
And this is a rebuttal that even just takes for granted the data part of Cooper extracted from bears being

2067
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,832
Accurate and it's presentation

2068
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,112
I just decided

2069
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:06,464
Stipulate that it is because I don't care whether it's accurate or not it actually makes no difference

2070
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,000
In terms of the conclusion

2071
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,560
Like it's it's

2072
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
Ridiculous

2073
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,376
It's a ridiculous thing that has

2074
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:18,496
Potential other explanation even if was being presented as data is act

2075
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:22,080
I'm starting to feel like our show is like

2076
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,616
Black Mirror version of

2077
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
Schoolhouse Rock

2078
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:27,968
Like when you when you hear that song about how I'm just

2079
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:31,040
Isabel ciego from nothing until

2080
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,088
And you're like I feel like I've learned something about

2081
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,112
Process here

2082
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:41,280
Learning about the process of b******* is really what's going on

2083
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,864
But that was only because terrorists asked me not to

2084
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,632
2

2085
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:48,448
This is a truly insane website

2086
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:53,312
Complete with suggestions of how to cure yourself of the vaccine is able to use at the bushes dump

2087
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,080
Conspiracies

2088
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,896
Cherokee Elementary this is the laundering process

2089
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,944
Are we go Schoolhouse Rock theme song

2090
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:02,272
This is just a misuse of various data at its core

2091
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:08,928
It's meaningless on its own but it gets misrepresented and misinterpreted on this website and it starts to take a little bit of a she

2092
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
Whose website is still

2093
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,792
Pretty inaccessible to most people

2094
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,584
If you're not already on board.

2095
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,168
You're going to see that you're not going to be swayed

2096
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:19,936
Alright whatever

2097
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,984
Tell Greg Reece comes in he makes

2098
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:27,360
Flick video packaging the claims of this website in a form that has the ability to scare people

2099
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:30,432
This videos also something that Alex can use because

2100
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:34,272
The site itself is too far was for Alex to really get a grasp on there's no hold

2101
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,552
For him to grab onto

2102
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:40,416
He needs concise talking points as opposed to a sprawling website full of insane.

2103
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,488
Reese's video provides him with those talk

2104
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,768
He can go forward

2105
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,536
From there

2106
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,560
Also

2107
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,840
Be clear

2108
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,424
What day is 8 months ago wasn't that the vaccine wasn't real

2109
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,472
He was saying that covid didn't exist

2110
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,008
There was no virus

2111
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:55,776
And maybe

2112
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,824
Viruses don't exist

2113
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,896
That was his take back that but I guess I was just want to get into that

2114
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,176
Let's get to choose between a

2115
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,200
Agree with that

2116
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:06,272
Or bring up something that David Icke said that looks really f******

2117
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:10,624
So I think you can see uvuvu

2118
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,160
Assertive

2119
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,440
I don't know

2120
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,208
Channel

2121
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:16,000
You still alive

2122
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:19,840
The chain of evidence

2123
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:23,680
We see the way that it's chiseled into something that

2124
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,704
Canby

2125
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Usable

2126
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,032
Yeah I know I did have its core what it is is

2127
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,336
Still the same s*** it's just

2128
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,360
Bears data

2129
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,408
Being dressed up in a certain way

2130
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,944
It's like a it's like a manufacturer

2131
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:41,344
Process it's it's literally like we've got this raw material that then gets refined and unrefined and refined refined until

2132
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,392
Do you have the diamond of b******* that Alex

2133
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,952
My only

2134
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,256
My only clarification I would make

2135
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,024
Is that like

2136
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,816
Are you looking to manufacturing process

2137
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,352
Usually the repeat of

2138
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,400
The same thing over and over again

2139
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,680
Whereas in order

2140
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,216
To make this

2141
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,240
Usable

2142
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:01,568
Propagandist usually after

2143
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:04,896
Process each side

2144
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:07,968
But you need to make it look different each time

2145
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
Yes but that's

2146
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,064
That's true.

2147
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,880
We won last year and it's Alex wax

2148
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,648
Sing poetic

2149
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,672
But how

2150
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,440
David

2151
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,464
David Icke

2152
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,256
We may never speak again

2153
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728
It is

2154
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:34,848
Parting is such sweet sorrow this could be the last time you and I ever

2155
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
Marc Broussard

2156
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,432
Let me last time wherever on air

2157
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,200
Today next week

2158
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,480
Xbox in

2159
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,272
That area where that house

2160
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,392
Let my enemies have the enjoyment here about what

2161
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,464
You going through some summer thing just

2162
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
The attacks of

2163
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
Much more

2164
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,816
Barely on air ride

2165
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,240
He's got cancer he said he's dead

2166
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,080
Deal about it it's just suddenly they're gone

2167
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:10,688
I love the idea that Alex is comparing himself like a family member has cancer was just on one day

2168
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:16,320
Yelling about how his show could be everyone to be in last year

2169
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,368
Yeah he's like a family member who yells at you

2170
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:24,000
Constantly about Heather about to die then tries to sell you something you don't need in order to keep them alive and also

2171
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,048
Turns out there life-threatening condition that they have

2172
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:29,632
Is a cut that gave themselves will trying to stab a random person on the street

2173
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,936
Not really.

2174
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:34,752
They keep trying to sell you things to keep alive its

2175
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,592
I'm in Noble

2176
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:44,992
A person who doesn't want to burden people with my illness or whatever that that's what he's trying to Metaphor camps private Wars as

2177
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:49,344
F*** are you type of person who's just there and then gone you know it doesn't make a fuss

2178
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:55,744
Out of the out of like what what are you going to be my aunt died of colon cancer

2179
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,072
You know I'm sure he would never would have complained about the

2180
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,864
The pain she was

2181
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,400
She was a

2182
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,680
Hard strong woman

2183
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
And I'm sure Alex is

2184
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,728
Just like her

2185
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,032
Such so simile

2186
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:12,128
I'm out of here f*** you I want to go to the woods

2187
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:13,664
Christ

2188
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:18,272
You're just a child who doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions

2189
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,576
How is that a thing that you can be at 40

2190
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:25,696
Actual child who just

2191
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,232
We have bases

2192
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:32,352
Essentially all of his worldview on dumb s*** that he read when he was younger and

2193
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:38,496
Hasn't updated really any of it

2194
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:41,824
Do an improvised storytelling to create a worldview in

2195
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,360
Conspiracies along the way

2196
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,896
Who f****** nonsense

2197
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,944
It is Aries like

2198
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,760
Whatever this stuff happens it is a little bit like

2199
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:56,416
When I was younger I love reading books when I was a kid I read read these books and there was always that line

2200
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,184
Find that like

2201
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,232
Everything you think you know

2202
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,768
Is not how it

2203
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,560
Right out and I was always

2204
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,888
Excited by that cuz it meant that the mundane boring aspect

2205
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,912
Facts of Life

2206
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,936
To be transformed into

2207
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:13,312
This show is like that it's like everything you thought about how the world works

2208
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,080
It doesn't work

2209
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,152
And I'm not excited because it's so much dumb

2210
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:19,712
Then I could ever possibly thought

2211
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:22,784
Level of intelligence

2212
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,344
Required to run a school

2213
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,624
Just on a phone

2214
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,160
Actual level is a principal

2215
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:31,488
Is far beyond anything that these people have ever consider

2216
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:36,864
And there's a president of the United States or whatever the f*** it you know like everywhere we go

2217
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,424
They're the people who actually run s*** and it's

2218
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,960
Insane but I think

2219
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,728
I think

2220
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,056
Not to defend

2221
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,360
The president of the United States let's say

2222
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,920
But I think you're not taking into account

2223
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,200
The

2224
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:51,968
Complication

2225
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,992
Cans of that job

2226
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:57,088
20 got a bunch of other people to do inform the people are crazy

2227
01:44:57,344 --> 01:45:00,416
Vice-principal

2228
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:10,144
Thinking more like

2229
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:10,912
Yes

2230
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,192
Alex is very

2231
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,472
Stupid

2232
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,776
And it is it is remarkable

2233
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,056
It really is

2234
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,152
But that's really goes to show

2235
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,944
How much

2236
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,480
A b Attalla

2237
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:26,528
And

2238
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,344
Rampant narcissism

2239
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,904
Check and unending confidence

2240
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:36,256
How much over the course of decades

2241
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,304
Expertise

2242
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,840
Intelligence

2243
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,912
The facade that

2244
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,472
Hi

2245
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
And yelling a bunch

2246
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,640
People are afraid to confront you about that

2247
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:55,712
Yeah but you got to be real stupid to believe

2248
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
Putin on the

2249
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,528
Just this once

2250
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:04,928
Too bad it's too dumb you got to be real dumb for this one no benefit of the doubt

2251
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,464
No no like hey

2252
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,512
We've all made mistakes before

2253
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,280
No

2254
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
Russia

2255
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,840
This is that you can't do that

2256
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
Just not this one

2257
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,424
It's it seems like a tough

2258
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,216
22 except

2259
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:23,104
Unless that's been what you've been doing for your entire career

2260
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,384
Talk to change now

2261
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,944
So anyway Jordan will be back

2262
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,736
Little breakey

2263
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:31,808
