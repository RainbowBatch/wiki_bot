1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,336
Quite a bit

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,432
You forced me into it I did watch a lot of

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,368
Seems like a stretch I need to bring you in

5
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,000
To the real world

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,168
Hot today Jordan you were brought in 1893 from the makers

7
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
Pepsi-Cola three all over again ladies and gentlemen

8
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
1393

9
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Blackcurrant

10
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
By the way I want to point out this is fair trade certified

11
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,768
They're definitely not lying to the faceless shadowy Corporation would

12
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
That is okay

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
I think it's a

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
It smelt air

15
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,008
Just okay

16
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Hey is what I'm getting at

17
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,712
So here is the deal beyond the soda

18
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Last weekend

19
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,112
We recorded our part our fifth installment of the investigation into what happened

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Alex Jones

21
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
In 2015

22
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
That led him to support Trump

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
I would love to say that I listen

24
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
Unfortunately I didn't

25
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Game show called

26
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Here is the deal

27
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
Yeah

28
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
Supported by

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Computer crashed

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,152
It's gone

31
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
For us

32
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,248
Dude Ryan remake the episode

33
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Fake

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Fake isn't Alex Jones

35
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,000
To make the same points

36
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
I feel so shity

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
So I don't want to do that

38
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
It would be fun though if my part was

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,448
Just played by a recording of be saying

40
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
That would be the nice wrinkle

41
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,920
So the next time I will be the Jordan feeling

42
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Squawk Box

43
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,280
Pictures of very liberal Squawk Box is a little angry

44
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
Little

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,960
Batters I have been going to doctors all this week and I've been

46
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Real busy

47
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,664
Yes so I've been just super busy trying to take care of that really preoccupied

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
Take me a little bit out of the game

49
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
On our way

50
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Which is

51
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,856
Delightful I'm still betting on

52
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Spider eggs

53
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
That's what that's my bet don't.

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
We pop

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,816
It's an urban legend.

56
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,936
Everything is okay with

57
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,520
There's no worry in the ass for me

58
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Atropine

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,456
Yeah you shaved into a

60
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Just f***

61
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,112
Fantastic. It's ridiculous

62
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Old Prospector levels

63
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
It's the next level of don't talk to me

64
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
Number train

65
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
We'll be going over

66
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
The period of July 22nd

67
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
To August 10th

68
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,640
Which was the original time frame of

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Are our fifth part of Art

70
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Investigation

71
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,904
Much more heavily on August 10th cuz we didn't really cover that all that well in the original version

72
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
And there's a lot more to discuss there and it will actually be fresh

73
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,887
It only feels right that we actually

74
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Hit some of the important point

75
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
From that time frame

76
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
So the first like half an hour

77
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
40 minutes of this episode

78
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Might sound

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,919
False on our Park

80
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Fair

81
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Yeah

82
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,575
So we all go there

83
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
So we start on July 22nd

84
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
And one of the most important things

85
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
We want to remind everybody is that Alex

86
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
Still very fool

87
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
By the Planned Parenthood videos

88
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
The game out from the center

89
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Upper medical progress

90
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
He is just

91
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,775
Hook Line & Sinker it feeds into his narrative he loves it

92
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
Unfortunately they are deemed frauds

93
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
Jail time is coming

94
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Jail time

95
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
Everybody in Congress

96
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
It launched investigations

97
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
Found Planned Parenthood

98
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
But

99
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
As an excuse

100
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
6 M play a

101
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
Absolutely and now all the negative repercussions

102
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Still coming

103
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,567
In fairness it's not like this video was the first thing ever to

104
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,407
Just me or Planned Parenthood for a long time

105
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
Yats guy

106
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Taking over

107
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
Anemone

108
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:08,383
Was in the top smartest people in Texas High School

109
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,343
When he was 16

110
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Until I was like four years old

111
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,303
Ubiquitous

112
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Almost join this call

113
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Told me about it

114
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
So Alex Jones is Dad almost became a globalist

115
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,079
Also you were screaming smartest person in Texas

116
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
I feel like this

117
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Smartest person

118
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
In the world becoming a dentist

119
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
Especially

120
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
Is the the

121
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
F****** father of a mans

122
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
The creator of this

123
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
How hard Alex videos knowing what we know now

124
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
It's hilarious

125
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
My discernment to so right

126
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
I'm still on the ball about everything I can't lie even when I try

127
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
They will prove it

128
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
New Evansville come to life

129
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,439
Where is let's try and figure out some new evidence on those videos that might work

130
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,071
Okay

131
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
That's going to be tough

132
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
Is it like the five minutes of the Knicks

133
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Sensor thing

134
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
The government

135
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
Oh oh no I see this is the

136
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Exactly

137
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
Okay

138
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
Sapote

139
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
The Planned Parenthood Liars

140
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Planned Parenthood

141
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
The globalist

142
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Kenalog

143
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
So now what this is like

144
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
Videos

145
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
Center for Medical progress and there was the actual version came out

146
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Planned Parenthood

147
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
Videos

148
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Completely full of s***

149
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
To haggle for money

150
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Even though all those committees

151
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Exonerate

152
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,447
Planned Parenthood

153
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,263
Controlled opposition undoubtedly

154
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,407
Center for Medical progress

155
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Alex Jones

156
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Which

157
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
He has been

158
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
6 months

159
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
He will be proven correct

160
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
I like

161
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Your confidence

162
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
I like the

163
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Also part of the

164
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Is it John Glenn isn't dead

165
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Pets in during covid

166
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Conspiracy theory

167
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
What about John Glenn

168
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,687
Number to walk on the moon dies first

169
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Just got to go down

170
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Strewth

171
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,087
We've got here the purpose of our investigation is of course

172
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
To figure out

173
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
Alex's

174
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
Mentality changed about drum

175
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
So it's important to every time

176
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
There comes up we got to discuss

177
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
Where his head was

178
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
About Trump

179
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
On our last episode

180
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
The mentality that

181
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
I don't trust

182
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
This guy

183
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
I'm going to

184
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Stop talking s***

185
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
I'm going to stop talk about how he's mobbed-up

186
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
And all that

187
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
I'm going to let this man to the bigoted

188
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Yeah

189
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,295
I love seeing my bigotry on a

190
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
National schedule but I don't trust him

191
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,487
He's probably lying about how much Haiti has

192
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Big like movie over

193
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
That's really what it was

194
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,887
Yeah he wants his ideas put out like

195
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Like if in the movie Armageddon

196
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
Instead of it being

197
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
The

198
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Asteroid

199
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
It is the government's

200
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
And black people

201
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Who made the

202
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Sure

203
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
That's what he want

204
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
You know

205
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
You got to go mine or something I'm not sure

206
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,119
So in this next clip Alex lays out where his head is at about Trump

207
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
On July 22nd

208
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
2015

209
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
It's pretty heroic

210
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Really really smart

211
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,391
He said that because he was the leader

212
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
And Trump

213
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
Trump

214
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Uncool

215
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
He's super smart he knows exactly what he's doing

216
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
And so just watch

217
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
On purpose

218
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
Knows all about

219
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Trump

220
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
The he's talking about

221
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Comments that Trump made about McCain

222
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Because he knows he has to

223
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,039
Trying to ruin the Republic

224
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
Zach bush

225
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Can get in there

226
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
You know

227
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
I think a lot of people were saying that then

228
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
I didn't go as pretty much I think

229
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
Was probably saying that back.

230
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
Just like fuk I need money

231
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
This is a great way to get

232
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
People to buy my shoe

233
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
A much attention

234
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Impossible

235
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
Whatever everybody realizes

236
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
I'm a f******

237
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Who is nuts

238
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Who is

239
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
Who is Justin old bigot who watches too much Fox News

240
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
They'll be like

241
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
We can't have you

242
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
UB president

243
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Can I get to go away

244
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
That's great

245
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
Literally everyone would have 1000 Alex is like I don't know

246
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
All these planes Maybe

247
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
I like titties on that tip

248
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
In the big picture

249
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,919
Small picture with monsters

250
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
Is getting pleasure women at the Hanoi Hilton

251
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
Another big lie about the wrong direction

252
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,327
McKay brings us to our next clip

253
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
He's trying to explain that Alex

254
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
John McCain

255
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
Is trying to make it illegal

256
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
Hi to sell vitamins without getting

257
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,871
Prescriptions were people

258
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
Because the end of this call is f****** hilarious

259
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
In order to buy a simple bottle of vitamins

260
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
He wants you to

261
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,879
Be required to get a doctor's prescription

262
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
To buy a simple bottle of vitamins

263
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Yet you and I being adults can walk into any store in the country and buy a gun

264
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Without a doctor's Blank gun

265
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,639
Dr. Kennedy

266
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
Was a correspondent

267
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:19,135
Yes

268
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
Shake Shack

269
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
You're the type of guy

270
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:39,615
Alex I'm old-school I'm 69 years old so I was one of those guys you grew up without the internet

271
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
But I have unlimited local and long-distance

272
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,087
So I can like so smart

273
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
So you've got to admit he has a house phone

274
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
Hilarious

275
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,727
I love your idea of of Alex actually sending out people to be like

276
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
Hey

277
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
We want you to go talk at the

278
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,151
This random things like dude I'm a f****** retired Old Man Without a landline

279
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,295
Smart

280
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
Fun facts on August 10th

281
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
Oh did you get hired

282
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
Nobody

283
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,471
Alex does not even seem to realize it's the same guy

284
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
New favorite character on the show

285
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:50,015
Those are credible dude from Wyoming

286
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
There's no denying

287
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:59,231
60 year old conspiracy theorist in the middle of Wyoming with the house phone

288
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
He's old-school that doesn't know about the internet

289
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
Well they don't actually have

290
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
I've been reading about the globalist in magazines

291
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
I don't have the internet

292
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Why can't read blogs that are full of s***

293
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
I still open the yellow papers

294
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,103
So I would probably want you to

295
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Get your information

296
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
From blogs

297
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Have you he wants you to

298
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
Look into the globalist

299
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Level

300
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Stuck clip

301
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
He had some things to say about vax

302
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
I meant he misrepresents

303
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Tucson knowledge base

304
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
A convulsion in the car

305
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,727
And then I never talked again that I warned you and it wasn't funny

306
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
I don't know what's going on but there was one

307
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Eman one-in-five

308
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,047
And then one-in-three Honcho

309
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,631
Throwing feces up against the wall

310
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
And then no one's asking what's going on why is this happening

311
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Written 40 years ago

312
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,599
41 years ago now in 1974

313
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
So I hear what you

314
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,255
What do you mean everyone was

315
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
Like that what's the ending to that plan

316
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Everything okay

317
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
So damaged and destroyed by vaccine

318
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Which

319
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Yes

320
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,503
They are throwing feces at the wall but that is not diarrhea caused by polio

321
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,855
It's a mixed bag of frozen frozen come

322
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
They are

323
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Absolutely

324
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
From the flu

325
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
But

326
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
Most of the population

327
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Damn

328
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
So if you're ugly

329
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
The grocery store

330
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
The robots are coming

331
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,319
Oh that's a good point Terminator Okay

332
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Globalist

333
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Work with robot

334
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,303
I suppose though I mean

335
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
The idea

336
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,703
There I guess would have to be in a profound welfare states

337
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
Yeah that's what the global is really want they just want to take care of people

338
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
We want people who are incapable of beating themselves

339
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,391
I could be your items you might have cracked the code

340
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Something really quick

341
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
These statistics about people who are diagnosed

342
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Misleading

343
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
Because you know 34 years ago

344
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
People who would have been diagnosed

345
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Nowadays as I would have been

346
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Call the tard

347
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
Yeah we're whatever locked in a room

348
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,919
Boys weird evolved approach towards a lot of mental illness

349
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Even

350
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Then the sixties or seventies

351
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,319
Psychiatric medicine

352
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,671
The 1800 was just a guy going around f****** up your brain with a knife

353
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Yeah

354
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Basalt lobotomy

355
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
These would solve problem

356
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Totally

357
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:50,911
But that was a lot longer than we think.

358
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
The idea

359
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,799
People who have autism

360
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
He's probably not true

361
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,407
The numbers might be going up slightly but

362
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
The numbers

363
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Jim

364
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,271
Like massively higher if they even alright I don't know

365
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
Reliable statistics on it

366
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
But even if that is the case it is

367
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
Dropped an evolution in diagnosis

368
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Not in the actual

369
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
You know a lot more

370
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
People are diagnosed

371
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
With

372
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
With tuberculosis

373
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Now as opposed to back

374
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
When it was just go

375
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
Write the rise and diagnosis of tuberculosis

376
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Yeah

377
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
Also

378
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,575
Feed the fun thing the reason why I desperately need to keep this clip-in is because I like to document every time

379
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,903
Alex Jones references one of his primary sources about global

380
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Yes because it's important

381
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,255
All of those

382
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Yeah because there's two

383
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,143
This one's Ehrlich right this one is John holdren

384
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543

To put things

00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
In your food in order to make you

417
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Infertile

418
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
I suppose

419
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Quote

420
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
The third approach to population limitation is that of involuntary fertility

421
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Control

422
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,720
Several courses proposal deserve discussion

423
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Mainly because some country

424
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
Ultimately have to resort to them unless current trends and birth rates

425
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Are rapidly reversed by other means

426
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:34,752
Adding a Sterilite to drinking water or staple food is a suggestion that seems to horrify

427
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,824
People more than most proposals for involuntary fertility

428
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Control

429
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
This would pose a very difficult

430
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
Political legal and social question

431
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Not to say anything of the text

432
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Ankle problems

433
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,880
Exist today to be under develop

434
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,720
To be acceptable such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff require

435
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
Hey must be uniformly effective

436
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,840
Despite widely varying doses received by individual

437
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
And despite varying degrees of

438
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
Fertility and sensitivity

439
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
They must be free of dangerous or

440
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
And must have no effect on members of the opposite

441
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
Sex children old people

442
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Or livestock

443
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Fret

444
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
I don't need to be made of

445
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:18,272
And I don't believe that there would be something

446
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,600
Do like a uniform substance that would work on men and women

447
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
So you just have things that would make you

448
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:28,256
Like women infertile and then

449
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,120
Or vice versa

450
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,680
Easier to make every man

451
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Yeah

452
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
Maybe

453
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
Forced sterilization

454
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
When would be the

455
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,896
Like if you are convicted of a violin

456
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Crime

457
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,368
Virginia most racist thing that would ever happen

458
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
That would go, really

459
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,720
Suggested like that have been made and shot down for

460
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
Personal reasons

461
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,864
It is goes on again there's no sign of such an agent on the horizon

462
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,448
And the risk of serious unforeseen side-effects

463
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Mitigate

464
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
Against the use of any such a gem

465
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
Even though this plan has the advantage of avoiding the need

466
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
A socio-economic

467
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
To discriminate against

468
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Particular group

469
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Or penalized children

470
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
Which is exactly what you were just talking to

471
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,088
Brett how in the past they have forced sterilization on

472
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
Criminals

473
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
As we all know

474
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
That's not a good way to do

475
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
So I guess I've never seen

476
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,496
They are making

477
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,128
Incredibly clear that this is not a good proposal there are logistical problems

478
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
There are moral problems

479
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
That it's not

480
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
It's not going to work

481
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
So they can cook

482
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
The globalist worry about putting

483
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Something in the water

484
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
With climate

485
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
Caboodle

486
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Turn on people when

487
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Drink

488
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,912
You can just have your armored redoubt

489
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
On the top of the hill or something I don't know

490
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,056
Keep all your robots

491
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Andy

492
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
People pay your poop thrown exactly

493
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,016
Most of the population control measures Beyond Family Planning

494
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Disgusted

495
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
Summer is

496
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,184
Impossible in others are and probably will remain on acceptable to most Society

497
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Although of course

498
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Maybe great

499
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,888
So they can possibly be incredibly effective

500
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
But it's impossible

501
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Would never be cool with it

502
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
It's not a reasonable suggestion

503
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,920
No that would be some serious Global s*** if you pulled that discussing it because it's a textbook

504
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
It covers all of it

505
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
For educational purposes

506
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,320
There's other techniques that are that are shown such as family

507
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
The

508
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
Even in this next

509
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
Paragraphs

510
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
Compulsory control of family sizes

511
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
Is an unpalatable idea

512
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
But the alternative may be much more horrifying

513
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,192
Has become clear to an increasing number of people in the 80s

514
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
They may begin demanding such

515
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Control

516
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
A far better choice in our view

517
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
History expand the use of milder methods

518
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Of influence

519
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
Family size preferences

520
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
While redoubling efforts to

521
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
I'm sure that the means of birth control

522
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Including abortion

523
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Sterilization

524
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Are accessible to every human being on Earth

525
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Within the shortest possible time

526
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,184
If effective action is taken properly against population growth

527
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Involuntary or repressed

528
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Measures can be averted in most come

529
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
I think the issue

530
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
She comes down to the fact

531
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
That

532
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
They're writing it

533
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
They're like it

534
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
Text

535
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
We're presenting this idea

536
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
And then we're shooting it down

537
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
To educate

538
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
So you know

539
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Do that ID

540
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Yeah

541
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,856
But they don't do that Riley like here is what we could do

542
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Is why we shouldn't

543
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Will do

544
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Just put in there like

545
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
Here's what's going on

546
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
It's f****** stupid

547
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:19,424
Well on an assumption that your listeners are an idiot

548
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
And they assume the people are going to understand

549
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
When educational Tech

550
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
It should cover all angles

551
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,224
So you learn about the

552
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Alex Jones

553
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,696
It would be possible to

554
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
I have compulsory abortions

555
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
Under the current constitution

556
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
Population growth

557
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
To get out of

558
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
Control

559
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,240
Be an actual crisis

560
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Such a way that it would be legal

561
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
5

562
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Would wind up being

563
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
The most racist thing that could

564
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Could ever f***

565
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:11,648
To get rid of total desirable Congress whenever that was allowed

566
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
F***

567
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
We would lose generation

568
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Not white

569
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Statement of

570
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,704
This would theoretically be possible under our law

571
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
Forcing people to get abortion

572
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
Is not Africa

573
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Like again

574
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
If they had like a little like

575
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Hey

576
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
We should make a log

577
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
Perfect

578
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
Yeah come out and advocate

579

Paperhouse

580
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Presented

581
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
In education

582
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Which is a dumb idea

583
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
You know once people started spinning these

584
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
John holdren put out

585
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Statement

586
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
Another book that describe different possible approach

587
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
Just a limited population

588
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
And then concluded that the author's own private

589
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Prince was the employee non-coercive measures

590
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Before the Environmental

591
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
And social aspects

592
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,528
Have overpopulation

593
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
Please do employee course at 1

594
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Doctor Who

595
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
Has never been an advocate of

596
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Compulsory abortion

597
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,208
Or other repressive means of population limit a

598
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Further

599
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
Came out and said we have

600
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,120
At the serious mischaracterization of Art

601
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
And those of John

602
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,496
Based on a misreading of our jointly authored

603
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
1977 book

604
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
Textbook ecos

605
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
We are not then

606
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Never have been

607
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
Of the Cronin measures

608
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,272
4 population limitation described but not recommended

609
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
In the books

610
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,832
60 + multi pages

611
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
How long is a full spec

612
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
Population policy

613
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,280
Have you ever been tried in some country or analyzed

614
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
But they're making

615
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Clear right now

616
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,888
Make it clear way easier

617
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Like a normal person

618
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
Fair enough

619
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
A f******

620
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
Course we don't think this is a good idea

621
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
Exactly

622
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:12,992
Statement come on assholes final like big

623
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,064
Suck on my balls you f****** idiots kind of

624
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,624
Havre de Grace

625
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
This is a problem

626
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
With us we're not

627
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,976
True

628
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,912
This is the new system

629
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,240
This is Matt

630
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
No nothing just besides

631
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
Put out the sides

632
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
Twitter is today it hasn't worked out well so far

633
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
Lot of hype man on the other side too

634
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
You know why

635
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
They speak

636
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,352
Sure

637
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Argument

638
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
About

639
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
Bruzdzinski I have

640
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
What series problems with based on

641
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
And I'm not saying what Alex says

642
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
And now further

643
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,408
His argument that people are trying to put

644
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
Things in the water

645
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
To sterilize you

646
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,296
It's gone completely Shaky Ground that's not what this textbook

647
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
Was talking about at all

648
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
OmniSource

649
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
He's straight

650
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Fuct

651
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
That is that is no good

652
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
So anytime you brings up that stuff just know that a lot of it

653
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
When pressed

654
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
To give a citation

655
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
This is what he do

656
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
And it doesn't say what he thinks he says

657
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
So

658
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Great

659
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
I love it

660
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,616
How do I spell angry

661
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,016
Episode I know you're very bad

662
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
It doesn't feel weird to me

663
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Listening to know Alex

664
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
Really surprised

665
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,632
We're going to get back this is the next

666
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,472
2 about an hour of the show is taken up by

667
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:15,360
Coming on the show chiropractor

668
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,992
I caught out that whole thing Alex Jones came out his

669
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
Trans-species

670
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
Cuz he's a dog

671
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:30,208
He wants to identify as a dog

672
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,072
Navigate to

673
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,936
You have trans argument

674
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Endo

675
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,104
Can I retract my argument dog

676
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
And videotape

677
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
Making a transphobic argument

678
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:06,048
I wish I had.

679
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
I'll post it up there

680
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Elementary

681
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Preschool age

682
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Daughters

683
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
Videotape in Macon

684
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Video where he claims

685
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
Empty was identifying as a dog

686
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:22,944
And one of them dress up in a gorilla suit in studio further

687
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Spell out the joke

688
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Which is not a joke

689
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
It's just bigot

690
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
You made a child

691
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
That's Heavy

692
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
This is why

693
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
Dr. group

694
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Did an hour

695
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,936
Body cleanse is going on in the group family of products

696
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
And

697
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,920
I don't give a f*** about listening to sell his product

698
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,504
Very important things came out about doctor groups

699
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
And Alex Jones's life

700
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
That the audience

701
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Deserves to know about

702
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
First one

703
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
Is about dr. group

704
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
Their historic they usually live longer than I mean historically women live

705
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,168
Resilient

706
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,312
My mom actually was shot 6 times point-blank range in the head with a 22 rifle

707
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:27,712
And she survived

708
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
She survived that

709
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
That's bad radio

710
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,136
Tell me more about that

711
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,304
Going to the point where that sounds like

712
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
Fascinating

713
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Mystic story

714
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
Well there's that but then also if Alex was to unpack that story

715
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,848
The most likely thing is his dad shot his six times

716
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
OSHA

717
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,688
If you use the technical analysis

718
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,992
He's making up for his evil father's crime

719
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
Yeah it's

720
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,320
Doctor group backstory

721
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
To toxic things

722
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,744
Veterans

723
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,816
Evils of his father

724
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Yes absolutely

725
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,144
Instead of weather stuff it's

726
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
Chemical manipulation of human

727
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
B y group

728
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Makes the cleanse

729
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,152
It could be whether it was

730
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
The dad that shot the mom

731
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
The story it's guns

732
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
Yeah and he doesn't want to talk

733
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:42,720
Those Second Amendment doesn't want to say it hear any stories

734
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,768
Ever that be great radio

735
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,840
It's not man. That goes against my gun narrative

736
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,192
You know what that could be

737
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
Could be

738
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Should Alex Jones is brain damn

739
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
And this next clip

740
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
Is Alex Jones

741
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Mites

742
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
They might not be well

743
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,224
And I had I think we already know that

744
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,528
I know but we're just building evidence up

745
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,368
I want to move on to

746
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,976
She just slowly

747
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,024
He's in the fog

748
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
I just need to clarify

749
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,680
You know what when we get this first time I forgot to do this second time forgot to clarify again

750
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,008
They just taking a call from a guy who was like a bug

751
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Control person

752
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Killer

753
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
How do you spell

754
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
Some chemicals on himself

755
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,944
I'm so doctor group is telling him to take

756
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
One time

757
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,976
The Army after 35 years

758
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
He's an older cousin

759
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,376
There were a few times where

760
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Father cousin

761
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,848
And they were

762
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Stop

763
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
I don't work with them

764
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
Topsail jobs

765
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
Experience

766
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,976
Remember going under houses with I'm spraying

767
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,328
How's it going

768
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
Hi at the Dairy Queen eating a hamburger

769
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
It was just so clear

770
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
Yes that's exactly what's happening and that's why we're here giving out solution

771
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
If you were a real doctor Yu-Gi-Oh

772
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Oh my God

773
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,312
Children's brains are very serious damage by

774
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,640
Being stuck under a house with dangerous chemicals

775
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:15,040
I'm surprised that Alex Jone isn't isn't in a room somewhere throwing is on

776
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Do you might just

777
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,392
Be competent for like 4 hours a day

778
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
Is a coiled spring and what

779
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
It could be

780
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,376
We've cut out a bunch of other stuff that we eat

781
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
Discussed on the first episode

782
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
That we lost

783
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
Doesn't really need to be discussed I'll break some of it down

784
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Alex Jones has a bunch of racist

785
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:44,480
He whitewashes the history of Oklahoma City

786
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
This fast

787
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,624
Whitewash has Oklahoma City and Timothy McVeigh

788
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
And he cites as one of his sources

789
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
For the truth about Oklahoma City

790
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Larry Nichols

791
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:03,168
Stevie Nicks

792
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Like okay well that is not

793
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Okay

794
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,800
You have invalidated your argument

795
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
Alex Jones revealed that what he lost for most in life

796
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,784
Is

797
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Hollywood

798
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Is that Bahama vacation

799
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
That we also

800
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,816
So using his millions and millions

801
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:35,680
Shipped on Friday July 24th

802
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,240
He spent two weeks in Europe

803
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
For two weeks

804
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,128
And I tried to throw

805
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Alex

806
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
Reported that I was only able to find a few of them

807
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,624
And they were just him playing vacation videos on Infowars

808
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
It was hilarious him just being like

809
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,232
He's just out at some Grecian

810
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Agora

811
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
And he's like

812
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,376
What's going on with the Greek economy

813
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Get me some souvlaki

814
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
If Collins came from

815
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
I'm drunk

816
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
Dragon ouzo

817
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,968
These goblets columns

818
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,504
He claims that he's going

819
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
To Europe all over Europe

820
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
To get to the bottom of it he's going to go find out what's up

821
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,904
EXO

822
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,536
It's got to go find out why all the countries in Europe are failing

823
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
And like I said

824
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
He's reporting with his shirt off

825
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
Excuse not doing anything

826
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
Okay

827
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
There's just

828
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
No

829
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
There's just no

830
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,152
Equivalent to his elsewhere like now

831
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Jackass

832
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
Maybe

833
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Yeah

834
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,064
I guess so it is

835
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
Just wild

836
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
It's sort of hillbilly appeal

837
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
Don't care

838
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,144
Isn't lying

839
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Well

840
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,032
Alex heard all of us

841
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,848
So he's on vacation to comes back to the studio on August

842
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
On August

843
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
6

844
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
2015

845
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,504
The first Republican Presidential

846
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
Primary debate

847
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,368
This would be when

848
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Yeah

849
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Edith

850
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,256
You could at least

851
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
Pretend that we have

852
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,376
It's all right to left

853
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
Andaz

854
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,984
Invalidating the entire concept of this show

855
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,336
I feel like there's maybe a little more to the concept I think maybe People Like Us

856
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
I have never experienced

857
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
You're right but I just can't

858
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
Pierce the facade of affected

859
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:03,135
I mean I know people are listening but at the same time we're sitting at

860
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,439
Into each other

861
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Hey Jordan shuttle know what's going to happen

862
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,583
You know I'm lying to you and I

863
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
Thingworx dad

864
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
You could be

865
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
This is your chance

866
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
This is your chance

867
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Alright

868
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Who knows what

869
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,943
Highbrow

870
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,223
Betrayed you immediately

871
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,551
You are no Daniel dad Lewis

872
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111
Am I

873
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Dwayne Johnson

874
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
The Rock

875
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
You're a better actress

876
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
Let's get to this next

877
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
August 10th

878
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
The first debate

879
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,991
Here is what he thinks about Trump

880
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
We are back

881
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,111
Thank you so much for joining us I will get the Donald Trump

882
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,207
Old MacDonald

883
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,607
Normally go

884
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,191
Malaysian Airline situation

885
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
He did

886
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
But also I just realized

887
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
He probably is using

888
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
Du jour

889
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Some Europe

890
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
I did not get

891
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,735
Consider that I am considering it

892
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
No

893
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,951
Any really he really leaned into it to like a distraction

894
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,999
MLS

895
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,279
They were

896
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,591
Developments came out but the other medium

897
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,223
We covered it probably 1/100 of what they did

898
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,783
Because that was a pure distraction

899
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,367
What does it matter

900
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
The world

901
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,255
I told the media was running with nausea

902
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
Donald Trump

903
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,655
Because it's about the 2016 election

904
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
The future of this country and the rest of the world

905
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,335
And whether he's a shill whether he is for Real

906
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
The study example

907
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,343
Of how the media is handling this how they're spinning it

908
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,647
How people are responding tells you a lot

909
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
And I'll say this

910
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,863
Obviously falls on his sword

911
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
Ball on purpose

912
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
AR lowers is finished

913
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,591
How do you make

914
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,895
And there will be

915
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,551
Evans chickens come home to roost resuscitation

916
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
I don't believe that's true but I know you're using a metaphor Alex I'm going to let you outside

917
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
He said that

918
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,943
Alex

919
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
Sheetz

920
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
In court

921
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,231
Look at this.

922
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
Commit

923
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Is being delish

924
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,911
You are so delusional that you think

925
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
Food

926
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,007
Is under the rule of law and

927
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:09,407
Look how about you

928
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,247
Do our ham sandwiches need to have less salt

929
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,599
Yes probably

930
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
This is a very Siri

931
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,071
That he knows him to be

932
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
You're wrong about everything

933
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
Mailed

934
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
You know like civil asset

935
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:44,479
Future and marijuana those two classic examples we have

936
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
There's a couple other things we started

937
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
Agreed with him in principle but disagreed with how he

938
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
He got to his

939
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Conclusion

940
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,183
Always wrong

941
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
He's just

942
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
Almost always wrong

943
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
50

944
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,607
This is all the narratives that we seen

945
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
Coming out about Russia

946
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,311
A little bit later that you haven't heard that makes it all the more so I can

947
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Scary

948
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
Cuz I think there is

949
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
Indication where he tips his hat

950
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
A little bit about knowing what the

951
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
The future holds

952
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,783
Have you ever discussed

953
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,879
Ghost

954
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,463
I think he has a premonition of what

955
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
Succumb

956
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
A little scary

957
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Nailed it

958
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
Accident

959
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
He has more things he wants to say about you

960
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,079
Trump

961
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,919
What is he planning on the election

962
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,759
Wales

963
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:56,159
Donald Trump

964
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Yirego

965
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:05,375
That Donald Trump was in conversations and consultation about

966
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Republican

967
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,703
Something Bill Clinton and courage him to do

968
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
The clintons loving

969
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,783
You're so desperate

970
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,599
Somebody tell the truth about Pluto

971
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,695
Open borders

972
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
Ravens scores of other issues

973
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Straight Talk

974
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,399
We're starving.

975
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Swell

976
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,247
Immoral strong popular opposition

977
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,903
To social engineering

978
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Viper s***

979
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,511
For sure we're going to find out about Donald Trump

980
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,863
Betrayed

981
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
Not that I don't like

982
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,735
Holyshit serious repercussions

983
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,599
The possible blackmail

984
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
And believe me

985
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,559
Donald Trump

986
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,991
So I just I just

987
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:01,599
It came to a realization almost simultaneous

988
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,207
Going by the proposition that he is correct

989
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
This one time

990
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,559
He's nailing it he's

991
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,911
All the sudden start speaking hard truth

992
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
Think of this

993
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Already

994
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
We run is Republic

995
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
You and I

996
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
Huh

997
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,967
Okay and then we f****** turn on

998
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,551
We got two years where we can do all kinds of s***

999
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,367
True District

1000
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,671
We can't wait

1001
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,463
No we can't live in Illinois

1002
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:46,911
Oh okay everybody

1003
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
Correct in all things

1004
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,031
We could definitely make a senate run but I don't think there's a vice

1005
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:04,831
Probably better than strawberries I got a growth on my channel

1006
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,159
Just for fun

1007
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
But he's looking

1008
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:16,095
Cuz he is assuming that the blackmail is coming from Hillary Clinton

1009
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:20,191
And what he's not considering is that there might be other sources

1010
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
Influence

1011
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Force between

1012
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
So I'm not suggesting

1013
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
Sara Lee the Trump

1014
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
Has been blackmailed by Russians

1015
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
Or the mob

1016
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
But I am saying that

1017
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Alex

1018
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,063
I think his assessment is pretty right on

1019
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
Except he's not putting the

1020
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,903
This together he knows that he's mob-connected

1021
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
He knows that he works in

1022
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Casinos in his

1023
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
The predator

1024
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Laundering

1025
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
Russian money

1026
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,631
He doesn't think that that is

1027
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
That Clinton's

1028
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Know about

1029
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,239
Can blackmail and because of that

1030
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
As opposed to

1031
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
To these mobsters

1032
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
Bmike

1033
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,103
We have our guy in the White House

1034
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
We can

1035
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
Run roughshod

1036
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,223
Make so much money

1037
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,247
Unequivocally

1038
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
God

1039
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,183
So I think Alex is right but he's blinded by his hatred of Hillary

1040
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
And he's just

1041
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Dumbness

1042
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,791
The globalist

1043
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,095
And the idea that Democrats

1044
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
Want to

1045
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,399
For socialism to

1046
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,471
To turn into communism to turn into totalitarianism

1047
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
Just gone backwards

1048
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,311
Skip the socialism

1049
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
And just gone straight

1050
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
From democracy

1051
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
We thought it would be hard

1052
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,487
I think Alex is missing the forest for

1053
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
For the trees

1054
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
I am anyways

1055
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Cuz he's so Focus

1056
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,119
So focused on fake global

1057
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,215
He doesn't see what's right in front of him

1058
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
Could have been right

1059
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
He could have been a hero

1060
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:07,455
Alternate universe

1061
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,783
Reveals the biggest story of all time

1062
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,087
He knows about Trump

1063
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
There would be nothing bigger than discovering

1064
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
But you're

1065
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:20,511
Has Infowars conspiracy theories website

1066
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:23,327
That one conspiracy theory you at

1067
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,143
Perfect

1068
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,679
Conspiracy

1069
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,471
Straight up

1070
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,799
Play goddamn Alex Jones

1071
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,847
Could go down in history

1072
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,663
Woodward and Bernstein of racism

1073
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:44,063
Make the caveat that that's not that great of a universe cuz then we have

1074
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Really arrogant

1075
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Okay

1076
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,255
I mean he's never going to shut up about Sandy Hook now

1077
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:58,655
Ivory

1078
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,983
Great Scott's

1079
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,383
As well

1080
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,991
I want to check your calls on the Trump situation starting

1081
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,063
I got some clips from the debates also have

1082
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
That's true

1083
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
Which of you judge Donald Trump

1084
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,631
By most of his past activities

1085
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:41,919
Supporter

1086
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,391
And links it to autism

1087
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,439
Something about Trump

1088
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,791
So you know is this the how is that the wind

1089
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,095
It's so weird that he's like all of these things like

1090
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
He's he's bro

1091
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
Is for abortion

1092
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,215
Kids for immigration

1093
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,799
But he's crazy about vaccines

1094
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
Elective

1095
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,407
Eat the bad thing is the thing that he looks

1096
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,455
That's very bizarre

1097
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
We should run as Republican

1098
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:21,599
I think this recording might hurt us

1099
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:26,975
And I still never find very very easy just

1100
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,767
To take all of the dumb positions

1101
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
Dunno resume

1102
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
With Republicans

1103
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,399
I am just run with them

1104
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
I don't know

1105
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,239
Who sings insane I think we would get killed

1106
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
If we did that

1107
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
If we ran on

1108
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,127
Fringe positions that are

1109
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,735
Just super crazy

1110
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:55,135
Dyed-in-the-wool liberals lockup eyeballs

1111
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,487
We still got some militia type would take

1112
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,327
Yeah

1113
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
Yet so Alex

1114
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,447
How many supports Trump

1115
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,983
They get to do it a little more easy

1116
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Dakota like

1117
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
You know what I mean

1118
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,847
I love Rand Paul

1119
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
He says

1120
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,431
Crazy things Trump says crazy things

1121
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,503
I like making it okay to talk about

1122
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
These crazy things

1123
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Even though

1124
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
I know the

1125
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
He loves the Clinton

1126
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,159
Even though I know his history says that

1127
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:28,927
Give

1128
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,231
You know exactly what I would hate

1129
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Even though

1130
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,839
Did my favorite politician Rand Paul says he's an a******

1131
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
All of these

1132
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,143
I got to give him a shot

1133
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Yeah

1134
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,543
It's it's like recognizes like

1135
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,151
Wants to be legislatively bigot

1136
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
Trump wants

1137
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,735
Yeah

1138
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,575
That's why you get an hour

1139
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:02,207
What do people do at the beginning

1140
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,511
Alright

1141
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,375
Be mostly about Trump

1142
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
He doesn't have taking a bunch

1143
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
Calls about Trump

1144
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,519
But before he does he's got to get into pretty serious issue

1145
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,079
That dovetails into a very racist

1146
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
Proclamation

1147
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,895
Black people are made of cheddar

1148
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
So what do you think about Donald Trump

1149
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
And then of course

1150
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,759
I'm just going to say this everyday

1151
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,575
Because now it's a season that folks actually care

1152
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,159
I drove into

1153
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,975
For twenty years

1154
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Also

1155
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
This is the summer

1156
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
He's about to happen does not mix

1157
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,287
This is not weather related

1158
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:54,687
It's not like a Christmas is coming up so we ought to bring up the culture War

1159
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,479
What's what's going on

1160
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:02,879
This is something I was informed on when I first got on air

1161
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,791
Talkin all these experts hollykit

1162
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,215
Your phone call

1163
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
I've been focused on

1164
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:26,431
Planning with brains and mice and pigs and cows and

1165
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,479
Spiders

1166
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,759
Jellyfishing

1167
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
Probably earlier

1168
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,311
Then they grow these humanoids

1169
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,711
Artificial site

1170
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
Okay

1171
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
Stocks trading on this stuff

1172
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,511
You're talking a bunch of kids

1173
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:36,319
Give the public understands that they're selling baby parts

1174
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,927
If they understand

1175
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,959
Computer

1176
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:03,199
Public to understand that's only the tip of the iceberg

1177
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
It's admitted

1178
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,087
The geoengineering

1179
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,231
Iceberg

1180
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,327
Everything

1181
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,399
What else I don't know

1182
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
Look

1183
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
We promise

1184
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,055
On the last episode

1185
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
That we

1186
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
On the Lost episode

1187
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,407
Broken down

1188
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:39,039
Some of these things so I want to run through some of it really quick

1189
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,855
He talked about spider human

1190
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,671
Yes is not real

1191
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,231
That is based on a natural news.

1192
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,815
About how there was a

1193
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
Who realized

1194
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
On a woman

1195
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,239
Channeling out there

1196
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,335
Great-great-aunt realized

1197
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
That spider silk is incredibly

1198
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,919
Strong and impenetrable

1199
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
You could make a skin

1200
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
Using fighter

1201
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,903
She created a false

1202
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
Skin

1203
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
That

1204
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:23,583
Might be possible to splice something

1205
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
Things to make humans

1206
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
Skin impenetrable

1207
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,215
Bratz there's a theory she thought it was possible wasn't testing it

1208
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
But

1209
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,151
This blog naturalnews.com

1210
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
That was

1211
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,943
This is happening

1212
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:45,855
And the interesting thing about that is naturalnews.com is run by Infowars employee Anthony

1213
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,391
ERD

1214
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
Naturalnews.com

1215
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
Natural news

1216
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,279
Nature

1217
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,327
It seems like that's bad nature

1218
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
Call

1219
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,263
The only one

1220
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,543
Zillow

1221
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,567
Maybe

1222
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:12,735
Armadillos are weird that I don't want to live in the desert I don't know the climates not good

1223
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
How many bullets

1224
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,551
I think I'm going to go

1225
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,855
For my bulletproofing

1226
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
Jellyfish

1227
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
Absorb

1228
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
They'll go right through me

1229
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,303
I'll be fine and you in a bunch of friends

1230
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,935
Could mold your bodies together and make a boat like jellyfish do

1231
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,455
Sov

1232
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
Don't know why that's funny but

1233
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Do it

1234
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,903
Brains are not being put into mice

1235
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
Unwraps that's important

1236
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:00,863
If you look into it you can find articles about this there are some tasks

1237
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,887
But have been done

1238
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
Where in

1239
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,191
Human stem cells

1240
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,495
Into mice

1241
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,055
In utero

1242
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:13,663
Create some of the architecture of human brains within the mice

1243
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
And the reason that they do this

1244
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,735
Is because

1245
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:20,575
Is there a lot of diseases Alzheimer's being one of them

1246
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
Bitcamp

1247
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,439
Be studied in humans while the brain

1248
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,207
Give me the live

1249
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,743
I just would be impossible

1250
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,023
But with

1251
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Mice

1252
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,095
You can do it right

1253
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,143
And it's kind of f***** up its ass

1254
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,983
But the important piece to take away from it is

1255
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,311
It's research that's going towards getting rid of

1256
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Horrifying disease

1257
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,127
And that's a plus

1258
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,199
That's what these ethical medical people will do

1259
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,735
That like

1260
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,039
It's kind of weird or doing this

1261
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,623
But at the end of the day if we can get rid of Alzheimer's

1262
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
Humanity

1263
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,975
But perhaps

1264
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
Private conversation

1265
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:07,167
Wildflower

1266
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,239
10 vote that it's like

1267
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
Your brain is going into mouth

1268
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,311
And then you're going to see out of my size

1269
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,175
It's not there still mice

1270
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
I get that

1271
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,783
There is there a hundred percent still mice

1272
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,063
And their guidelines

1273
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,623
Jensen place where any bikes that have

1274
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Human

1275
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,463
Brain cells in them have to be killed Within

1276
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Like two weeks

1277
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
Part of the park

1278
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
I just now I

1279
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
I really like

1280
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,935
List

1281
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
Some scientists

1282
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
If you are list

1283
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:42,751
They are

1284
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
Just take out all the

1285
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,335
Just just for me one time

1286
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
Just take out all the mouse-brained

1287
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Just put in

1288
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,223
Just put in a s*** ton

1289
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:56,319
Fred's irs's Midnight Man

1290
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
Because the

1291
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:02,719
Truth is like who doesn't want mouth one time

1292
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,023
I've read Flowers for Algernon I'm okay

1293
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,631
Conversion I don't need a distraction so sad

1294
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,911
It wouldn't have to

1295
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
Maybe this time

1296
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:18,591
Human story right there we'll get it right this time and we never do

1297
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
But maybe the super intelligent

1298
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
It might people

1299
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
We'll get it right

1300
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:26,015
Position about it being like actually

1301
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,807
Human half mice

1302
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,623
Is f****** absurd if you know anything about Sia

1303
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Further

1304
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,255
The stuff about cows we went over on the last episode

1305
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,303
Throat

1306
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,007
The Pig stuff is all just a bad growing

1307
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,055
Human organs within pigs

1308
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,591
Not an exact science

1309
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,127
Isn't

1310
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,663
Practice at all

1311
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
And it

1312
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,223
Not

1313
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Pigs aren't parking

1314
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,575
Further I was talking to my doctor buddy doctor gums

1315
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
About this

1316
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,135
Is

1317
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,927
Saint for humoring me about

1318
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
My dumbass question

1319
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,279
What

1320
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,071
Seems to be afraid of in some way

1321
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,375
Is that we're putting these

1322
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
Human brains into mice

1323
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,703
And they're going to breathe

1324
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,751
It's going to create races of

1325
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Super cute like

1326
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Super mice

1327
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,103
I'm totally on board with

1328
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,639
Impossible

1329
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
As long as it's mine

1330
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:32,319
It's fine I like your I like your stipulation there

1331
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,111
It would not pass

1332
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,647
To the children

1333
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,695
In the same way that if you put like

1334
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
Techno dude

1335
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,351
Implant of a magnet in your scars

1336
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,823
Hereditary

1337
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
These animals don't reproduce

1338
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
Finger

1339
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
Alex is afraid of life

1340
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,599
Is Planet of the Apes scenario

1341
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,415
And it just is not at all what's being done

1342
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
It's not possible

1343
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
So Alex Jones

1344
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,767
All this

1345
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
Chimera stock

1346
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,095
Is based on in the same way he doesn't

1347
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:19,423
Understand what

1348
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
Standees

1349
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Berating

1350
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,983
And I know that

1351
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,799
Because on his show when he's talking about these things

1352
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,591
He flashes up the articles

1353
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Do you talk about

1354
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,407
And I found them and read them

1355
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
And what I mix

1356
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,479
Is what they say

1357
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
It's not that

1358
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,463
Yeah but don't you love this Alex Jones I love the fear-mongering about chimeras Alex Jones

1359
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,279
Don't give me Muslim hating give me a

1360
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Statues

1361
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Yes

1362
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,423
I also a listener Madison

1363
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,983
Treated at us

1364
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,031
And that is

1365
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
Alex might be talking about

1366
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Dulce base

1367
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,711
Okay where's the Dulce base

1368
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,807
I don't know how to tell you are a very boring

1369
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,439
Much

1370
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
I hate you

1371
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,375
How to score 14 bel-ray

1372
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
What is Jordan

1373
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,703
I like the idea

1374
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Score

1375
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,591
There's an arbitrary

1376
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:36,991
This is like Whose Line Is It Anyways but for Alex Jones related podcast

1377
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,415
Mexico I am looking into this a while back

1378
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,791
I did a bunch of research into it

1379
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,375
Basically there is an army base

1380
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,935
9 floors Underground

1381
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
The Reptilian

1382
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Alright

1383
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:07,711
The reptilians are working with humans down under the

1384
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
And there's all kinds of

1385
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,551
Secret experimentation going on down there

1386
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,879
It's I mean it's all

1387
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
Basically

1388
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:19,743
Space aliens working with people to create hybrids

1389
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,559
And all this s*** under Smith

1390
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Doctor Who

1391
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:29,727
And all of the bunch of bases that are connected by underground tunnels where the reptilian

1392
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
I'm working

1393
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,871
David Icke level nonsense

1394
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
Yeah yeah yeah

1395
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
Do it on the Bus videos

1396
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,039
Adult

1397
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,855
Score one for me

1398
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,791
Suffice it to say

1399
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
And if he is

1400
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
That's crazy

1401
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
If he's not

1402
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,887
Still crazy

1403
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,679
But he's also misrepresenting everything

1404
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
Now I promised

1405
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,727
But the script was going to end

1406
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,263
Something weirdly racial

1407
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,103
Did you promise

1408
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,687
I turn my phone off I was sleeping

1409
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,711
I woke up

1410
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,759
Turns out I was driving

1411
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,255
3030 5050

1412
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,791
Maybe flying

1413
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,119
2000 yd

1414
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,079
Ice crystal forming behind it

1415
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,895
Turn my phone on

1416
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
Because we're flying on the same path just the other direction

1417
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
Gone

1418
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,807
I was watching the ice crystals

1419
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,623
Disappear in front of me

1420
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,487
Performing at high altitude

1421
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,511
Watch her supposed to

1422
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,327
It was dissipating

1423
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,935
Within 30 seconds

1424
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:17,759
Everything is incredible because you see the propaganda you see the manipulations he wonder what else is going on

1425
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:25,951
Page Manor projects in projects

1426
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
I've kept quasi Secret

1427
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,559
Squared

1428
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,887
I don't even know how you doing

1429
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,447
Which is admittedly going on

1430
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,543
All the specifics are classified

1431
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:44,383
Underground

1432
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:50,783
People again

1433
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
F*** you

1434
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:10,239
Because it's divide and conquer

1435
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:15,615
So his version can't we all get along is what

1436
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:20,735
So it isn't particularly angry homeowner

1437
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,647
So it's a

1438
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:35,327
70s Lily for taste that we are looking at what he said in 2015

1439
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,351
But this is

1440
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
On the heels of

1441
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:42,239
It's like Ferguson happened not too long before

1442
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,543
The Charleston shooting happened a month

1443
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
Before they're so

1444
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,127
So

1445
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,663
Incredibly racist

1446
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
Today's to wave it away

1447
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:55,039
Right even if you even if you think it's not that big

1448
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:59,135
A problem at least have some sort of empathy

1449
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,671
Why people are angry

1450
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,743
No because they're dumb because they don't know what they're spraying up there

1451
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,815
Guys just got murdered by the cops

1452
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
Can't you at least for one second be like

1453
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
Bad that

1454
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,703
Black people are getting murdered by the cops

1455
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,727
You don't even say that

1456
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,775
He's like you guys are just

1457
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
Not this is a tragic event

1458
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:19,871
And it's a

1459
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
Distraction

1460
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,479
This is bad and you fallen for this dumb old

1461
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,039
What you know is

1462
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:33,695
Perception of George Soros

1463
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,815
Everyone who's mad about these

1464
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,351
Or just tricked by George

1465
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,399
The roast

1466
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,215
Because if we came together would be able to find out

1467
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,007
About fees

1468
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,031
When is

1469
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,079
Story about being on a plane

1470
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,615
Not being chemtrail

1471
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,199
So that's what really

1472
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
Confused

1473
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,783
Because I remember listen to this clip

1474
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
And being like

1475
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,623
What do you say in the jet was good or bad

1476
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,695
But now I listen back to it and he saying like

1477
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
All of this happened like it

1478
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
Supposed to

1479
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
Yeah

1480
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,559
So what's your story

1481
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,375
Where you going to get off your phone to take a picture of like

1482
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
And here's

1483
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,935
Things no

1484
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:22,335
No I think his story is that like every other time it doesn't look like this

1485
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,663
Maybe what he's getting at but it's

1486
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,687
Cheerleader

1487
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,479
And that's why they're boarding

1488
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,551
Delray

1489
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,599
Speaking of abortions Jordan

1490
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,671
Next is where we begin

1491
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,255
From the August 10th at the

1492
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,303
He gets more into Trump

1493
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,839
But in the next

1494
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,631
You directly contradict

1495
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,655
You said in the

1496
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:53,567
The issues of Kim

1497
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,383
Involved in them in the past

1498
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,223
By myself I used to believe in

1499
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,039
Come Along on those issues once you start

1500
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,623
Learning more about it

1501
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:13,023
I wasn't involved in that Sam was going on

1502
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,815
Didn't do enough to stop it

1503
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,375
That's a coward's way

1504
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,679
It is almost more cowardly what I did

1505
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,471
Blind dying it

1506
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Let me be clear

1507
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:31,455
I was not good

1508
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:37,855
The way I was when I was 18 20 years old

1509
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,927
To repent for lying

1510
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:43,231
Either that or the time

1511
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
And I quote

1512
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:48,095
I don't judge people until I paid for them

1513
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,143
One of those

1514
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,727
Paperboy

1515
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:58,591
Clarify.

1516
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,383
Oh that's true

1517
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:06,271
He might not actually be even more of a coward's way out

1518
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
Going on

1519
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,087
We're all three of these are kind of like

1520
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
It's a triangle

1521
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,159
Yeah but be that as it may

1522
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,231
It's like he's in a romance

1523
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
Comedy with

1524
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
Yeah

1525
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,351
Meet cute with abortion back out he was 18

1526
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,031
Bumped into this abortion and I was like oh my God

1527
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
It is

1528
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
Love at first

1529
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,871
Can I play

1530
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:38,271
A large part of this episode

1531
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,575
We get to get a really good glimpse

1532
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,367
What else would like

1533
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
On August

1534
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,671
2015

1535
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,975
About what who Donald Trump is

1536
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
And what do you think

1537
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
And

1538
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
We're not

1539
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
A real

1540
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,471
Change

1541
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,263
And we know for a fact

1542
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,079
Because you know we live in 2017

1543
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,615
Then in December

1544
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,431
Has Donald Trump on the show

1545
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,199
Right

1546
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
And this is

1547
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
4 months

1548
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
Before that

1549
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
Do something

1550
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,343
Hamster really really pivot and we don't

1551
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,879
Like you think you'd see it by now

1552
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,231
And it's not especially with how intuitive is a median

1553
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
The following

1554
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,327
He's full-on like

1555
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
Jesus

1556
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:28,191
And I'm not saying like to the came on my show

1557
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
Just be that good

1558
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,079
From Trump and that was it if that's

1559
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Strfkr though

1560
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
Yours is next clip where Alex again

1561
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,479
Pretty right about Trump

1562
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,759
Trump

1563
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,599
Animal

1564
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:54,559
He's the casino business that's his dirty business as they come

1565
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
How can you be so right

1566
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,655
I don't have a good gut feeling about Trump

1567
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,191
I know

1568
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:04,543
Him specifically I don't have a bad gut feeling

1569
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
Just feels like a setup

1570
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,199
Because what he's saying is true

1571
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,063
Change crew

1572
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,135
Send it

1573
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,671
Because what he saying is true

1574
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
What's the same time

1575
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
I got some concern

1576
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
So I mean

1577
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,607
He's wrong that Trump is

1578
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
Well Cienega

1579
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
This is our cover

1580
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
Running is Republican

1581
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,591
We're being blackmailed

1582
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
It's you can't

1583
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Look

1584
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,199
We've said some very Progressive things

1585
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,991
Sure

1586
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,271
Maybe I've

1587
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
Stetsom

1588
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,575
Jailable thing

1589
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,599
But

1590
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,159
What what I'm saying now is

1591
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:56,511
Give me the best of about Republicans

1592
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
It's lost

1593
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,863
As long as they have or at least libertarian

1594
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,215
They feel like they're under attack or at least their ideas

1595
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,007
Do support who's ever saying

1596
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,567
And they always feel like outside

1597
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,127
You know

1598
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,199
Politician

1599
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,479
B social progress

1600
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,551
And people being equal is an attack

1601
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
People on the conservator

1602
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:24,671
Well if you've always been number one

1603
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,231
The idea that everybody comes

1604
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
Quota.

1605
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,279
Steam's exactly

1606
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,815
Play like you're falling

1607
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,631
So if everybody goes up

1608
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,935
That feels like

1609
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,959
You're not as

1610
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
As high as you used

1611
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
So it's it's

1612
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Teams that you know

1613
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
And also I

1614
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,127
They're mad at problems that

1615
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
Will not

1616
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
Cannot be solved

1617
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,759
Like the solutions they want our

1618
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
As we talked about

1619
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Kohl's

1620
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
Aren't coming back

1621
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,111
We have f****** robot

1622
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,695
That you're mad about that but you're losing to robot

1623
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,767
Like that's not going to stop

1624
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,815
They're mad about immigration

1625
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:08,447
We haven't all giving me your weak you're tired

1626
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,007
Like no matter how much you fight again

1627
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,824
Against that the only way that that is

1628
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,200
If Donald Trump becomes a literal dictator and start standing on our borders with me

1629
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,760
Frankly

1630
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,320
If that's the worst that he does I'm fine

1631
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,112
Hell of a wall

1632
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,904
Donald Trump

1633
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,744
Donald Trump

1634
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,792
Kelowna Mendes

1635
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,120
So one of the things that's kind of fun

1636
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
Is it Alex

1637
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
Pole

1638
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:46,592
Around the around the studio he wants you want to check the temperature of the

1639
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Studio

1640
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,640
Check temperature of his

1641
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
Staff about what they think

1642
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,200
Think about Donald Trump

1643
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,224
So we got a guy in the

1644
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
Control booth

1645
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,856
Who I don't work there anymore

1646
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,160
Famous cliff

1647
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
When Alex

1648
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,744
What do you think about Trump

1649
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,584
Is John Wall

1650
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:13,984
Overall on Donald Trump

1651
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,360
Why does the country need a Meg

1652
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,920
Maniacal narcissistic

1653
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,456
To pull it out of the rut

1654
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,784
That's just not what America is about

1655
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,088
And help him

1656
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,072
Pretty good on population control

1657
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
I just

1658
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,752
I can't believe

1659
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
Trump

1660
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,152
Jay Jay

1661
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:59,040
You do not have a job for much longer

1662
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:05,440
How to spell mad that everybody Compares Donald Trump to Hitler and Napoleon

1663
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
These guys worked out

1664
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,072
No he's joking

1665
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
You can tell he's joking

1666
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
I don't know

1667
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,960
Comparing Trump to

1668
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
Like dictators

1669
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,776
Ama

1670
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,872
What are you saying that like there was a guy in Germany was pretty confident

1671
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
She's f****** route

1672
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,248
Saying positive things about Hitler

1673
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,528
In order to compare

1674
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,672
So everybody it's fair game

1675
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,488
Trump Hitler stuff is

1676
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,424
That that would be a good choice for the country

1677
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:53,056
Donald Trump

1678
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,128
He's doing an impression of Alex in 2 years

1679
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,432
But he's doing in future Alex

1680
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,968
Compression

1681
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:04,064
But that is true move over Anthony atamanuik

1682
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,136
I just don't think that's the way we should be going

1683
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,072
Dominated by the bull

1684
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:21,216
Overall some people's responses they want somebody

1685
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,752
The problem is

1686
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,128
Charisma

1687
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:33,504
Is Providence if he's for real

1688
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,184
Taxi want to be president actually want to save the country

1689
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,560
Who were Macho and arrogant who were not evil

1690
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,632
Who were able to pull countries out of a run

1691
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:53,728
Confidence and giving people the perception

1692
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,568
The problem is horses

1693
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
Yasser means

1694
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,576
He is a little bit saying that

1695
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,600
Hitler has

1696
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,928
Some good quality

1697
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,744
At the cost of

1698
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,816
Millions of people's lives

1699
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,352
These guys are right

1700
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
Jodeci

1701
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,400
But yeah

1702
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,168
Lake Jennings

1703
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
Everybody

1704
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:28,800
Including idiotic Infowars people

1705
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,896
We're right about Donald Trump the only people wrong about Donald Trump

1706
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,712
We're 25% of the worst people on the planet

1707
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,808
Disrespected even the people who were working for Trump to Rodger Stone

1708
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,160
2

1709
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,440
You want to know something

Clip

1712
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,048
Scary

1713
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,840
This next clip

1714
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
You predict

1715
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,632
Almost

1716
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,448
Exactly what's going to happen in the world

1717
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,776
I can't be sure I told you he might be a soothsayer

1718
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
I have this next clip

1719
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,152
Cinefamily

1720
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,968
Calista it's scary

1721
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,832
And absolutely

1722
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,208
Your leaders are

1723
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,304
Leaders are compromised sold out to

1724
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,632
And part of a plant

1725
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,128
Maybe they're going to give us Trump

1726
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,944
As a strong man during the collapse

1727
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:48,160
Popular

1728
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:56,096
But it can easily be twisted into a form of fascism and just like the Democrats

1729
01:25:56,352 --> 01:26:01,216
Cult of communist wannabes led by fascist

1730
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,008
Knuckledraggin called

1731
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,920
It were very good on many points

1732
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:16,320
But the Republicans into something

1733
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,648
Something big is about to happen

1734
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,464
So I mean right there in that clip Alex

1735
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,536
100% predicted the rise of Mike cernovich

1736
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,840
He predicts the rise of Gavin begin

1737
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,120
He predicted

1738
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,656
He will become

1739
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,960
And this to me tells me

1740
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,984
But he's not

1741
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:34,752
The same man

1742
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,032
Even on August

1743
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
2015

1744
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,592
If you will be

1745
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,128
Probably at the end of 20

1746
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
15

1747
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,176
Does that but he predicts

1748
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,784
Yeah

1749
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,832
Set the tea party and the right-wing

1750
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:54,720
Are completely susceptible to Fascism yes he has

1751
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,144
A very amazing insight into his own group which he now completely lack

1752
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,168
Daddy

1753
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,192
That is bananas

1754
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,264
I refuse I refuse to believe that

1755
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,568
I meant this is the craziest part

1756
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:14,176
Business before like Sarah kendzior and at all of those people

1757
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:18,016
Before people are still talking about it

1758
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,344
A mainstream

1759
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,160
She was publishing stuff like over the summer

1760
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:28,768
The territory where she was already issuing a warning

1761
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,816
The point being

1762
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:35,680
Nobody in the major is everybody was treating him as a joke Alex Jones

1763
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:38,496
The only person who's like a Republican

1764
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,128
He's not saying that he's staying that there's two

1765
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,152
Susceptible to it

1766
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,176
Which is

1767
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:50,016
I mean it's predictive in some ways it's

1768
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:53,600
Vicki knows that

1769
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:56,416
Makes me really scared about that clip

1770
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,464
That

1771
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,256
In the same way that when I first

1772
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,048
Discovered the Clipper he was talking about

1773
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,096
Being mobbed up

1774
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,656
And you

1775
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Change your mind

1776
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,448
Means something

1777
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,216
Bigfoot

1778
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
You learn

1779
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
Something

1780
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,848
That preclude your knowledge

1781
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
Mob ties

1782
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,664
This clip

1783
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,736
Whatever happened

1784
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,064
Made him okay with becoming this

1785
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,600
Thing that he's afraid of

1786
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,928
Like you in this clipping saying that the the right-wing is

1787
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,208
Susceptible to fascism

1788
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,512
I there's acceptable to becoming this

1789
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
The thighs ugly

1790
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,328
Ugly thing

1791
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,888
And yeah

1792
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,984
Like you looked in a mirror news like

1793
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,544
You know what I think I might be susceptible

1794
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,592
He's aware of it and he lets it happen

1795
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
Which

1796
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
And not just let that happen

1797
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,688
Openly

1798
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,552
In the rise of the Winger's

1799
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,344
Completely

1800
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
People like

1801
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,416
Mike cernovich

1802
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,464
Rebel media

1803
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,488
Sobiech type

1804
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,768
Like he is

1805
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,584
Use complicit in all of these things that he's

1806
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:12,448
Ostensibly issuing a warning about

1807
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
So

1808
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
No

1809
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,080
He knows what he's doing

1810
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,616
On some level I

1811
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,384
I think

1812
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,176
That's scary

1813
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,200
This is bananas

1814
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
Yeah

1815
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,784
Clip to me was very unsettled

1816
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,576
Like okay

1817
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
With Alex

1818
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,696
Okay

1819
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,536
Know if there's one thing I know about Allie

1820
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,328
I don't think so

1821
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,424
I would give up

1822
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,960
Is future career prospects

1823
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,728
Just for money

1824
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,800
Cuz I think he has a good operation going swindling news

1825
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:49,568
Is fam

1826
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,944
But imagine he was promised a TV show where he gets

1827
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:02,112
I do also believe him that people have offered him

1828
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,952
I agree

1829
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,536
The conversation came into being

1830
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
He still

1831
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:15,936
Couldn't do things on that panel he couldn't do on Fox

1832
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
What you can do

1833
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,520
Say whatever bulshit you want

1834
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:21,568
But Fox would let him do that too

1835
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,384
SEC regulation

1836
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,944
I think that was added that was exactly the converse

1837
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,480
Deer Fox

1838
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
To like yes

1839
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,552
We will let you spout Crazy Bowls

1840
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,576
But only to a point

1841
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
Trump was like

1842
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,136
Dude I don't give a

1843
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,696
Okay

1844
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,976
I think that

1845
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,512
Not enough

1846
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,816
I think if you let him run Trump

1847
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
Maybe

1848
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,424
Gets his own

1849
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,960
TV show Network

1850
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,240
Kisses on network

1851
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
Alright

1852
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,288
Pull it back from Network

1853
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,080
No cuz I don't think a show is enough for him

1854
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,664
Okay you would Joe

1855
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
30 million dollars

1856
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:03,552
Turn the nursery light

1857
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,880
D-mat worth is

1858
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,904
Cuz otherwise

1859
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
If you look at

1860
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,720
It just the growth pattern

1861
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,280
I mean I've been

1862
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,816
20 years that he's been doing

1863
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
First flight

1864
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,144
10 work that great

1865
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,424
Right or so

1866
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,216
He's had a pretty

1867
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:24,032
Steady rise in the past

1868
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,848
If you were to look at his growth

1869
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,384
And be like okay

1870
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,944
This guy is trying to get me on board exam

1871
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,968
I know

1872
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,504
Is Mob connected

1873
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,344
He might lead our people into fascism

1874
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:38,880
I am

1875
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:39,904
Going to need

1876
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,464
Something that is out of the question

1877
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,744
4 MI

1878
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,280
Potential to gain

1879
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:51,936
Going to mean like threat if enforced keeps growing at the current rate if we expanded the ways that I know I'm capable

1880
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
Been doing

1881
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
4 years

1882
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:59,104
I need something I could never achieve on my own

1883
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
On TV

1884
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
I've already

1885
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:05,760
You don't know that that's true we don't know that Morgan's career

1886
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,832
All right you going to

1887
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,392
24th at

1888
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:15,232
I don't know it's interesting to speculate about

1889
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,256
But what

1890
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,280
I mean

1891
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:21,376
What's most fun about speculating about a counterfactual

1892
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,400
Because

1893
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,704
He didn't lose

1894
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,520
Didn't get what you need

1895
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,824
Right

1896
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,128
Which leads me to think there wasn't

1897
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
Underage

1898
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,688
But like that because then

1899
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,736
Domino's

1900
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,296
To be like okay I get their patrol

1901
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
TV network

1902
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344
And not having

1903
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,648
Contingency plan what do I get if you whip

1904
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,952
It can't just be tons

1905
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
There can't be

1906
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
Okay

1907
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
I don't know it

1908
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,936
I can't believe that

1909
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
Purely

1910
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,264
I love how Trump

1911
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,032
Hates muzzle

1912
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
As much as I do

1913
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,360
It's just out-and-out

1914
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:07,712
Strfkr either way

1915
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
It really is

1916
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:13,600
He is the guy who's all about freedom and libertarian values and

1917
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,392
Free market and blah blah blah

1918
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:19,232
And he's worried about leaving us

1919
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,536
Trump is leading us into fashion

1920
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,840
Destroying the free market

1921
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,120
Yeah it's so if Alex

1922
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,656
Really understood the thing

1923
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,216
He's concerned about

1924
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,800
Stevie's

1925
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Please road marker

1926
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,872
And be like I have gotten on the wrong

1927
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,664
And he's not even

1928
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,432
Close to that

1929
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,992
Yeah but also the middle

1930
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,016
Can get on the right

1931
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,320
Be huge

1932
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,856
I think that that would be

1933
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Be fine

1934
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
Not for him

1935
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,696
I think his list that means he would have to

1936
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
D'usse

1937
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,256
He was wrong

1938
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,096
There's so what it's Alex

1939
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:00,704
There's a way to do that powerfully we talked about it

1940
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,336
He still can't say there's a way for him to do that that doesn't make

1941
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,360
Emasculate

1942
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:10,176
There's a way to prevent it

1943
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,736
I was completely lied to

1944
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,272
This

1945
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,296
Supposition

1946
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:22,208
The chance if you really wanted too late for that

1947
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
Return

1948
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
Amount

1949
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,048
Right

1950
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:29,120
He had was that when Trump announced

1951
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,144
The globalist

1952
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:36,288
I'm a nationalist and the globalist

1953
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,824
Look guys

1954
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,616
Rodger Stone

1955
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
Fatality a lot of bulshit

1956
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:48,320
All of his reporters perspectives

1957
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,880
We got caught

1958
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,440
It would be possible

1959
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
He could do it

1960
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
Think about his listeners

1961
01:34:56,768 --> 01:35:00,352
They would absolutely if they bought into him

1962
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,632
They would try and kill

1963
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:07,520
No it's well yeah baby baby they were totally try and kill Trump

1964
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,312
Alex came out and was like

1965
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:13,152
Red Alert truck just revealed he's a globe

1966
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,176
His listeners who

1967
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,480
Of which I would assume

1968
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,016
90%

1969
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:22,880
No I think he would have to I think you would loose up because a lot of people really love true

1970
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:26,976
Okay I was telling you can call through a lot of his show

1971
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,792
And most of them weren't worth it so I didn't cut them but one

1972
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
Is coming up that you'll see

1973
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,632
Add very indicative of all of the calls

1974
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,704
And they're all just parroting his opinion back to

1975
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:38,240
Okay they're all just

1976
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:41,056
He says he's true things and I like him but I don't trust

1977
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:44,128
Read all of his callers basically just have whatever

1978
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,152
Perspective he tells them

1979
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,712
So whenever

1980
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,760
It's a very rare thing for

1981
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,552
For someone to have a narrative it doesn't

1982
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:55,136
Old man Wyoming

1983
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,160
And says

1984
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,280
And maybe some slight variations but with

1985
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,048
The same

1986
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,888
Narrative

1987
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,960
Isaac licking it would be a pivot

1988
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,520
Certainly

1989
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,568
Funny people

1990
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:17,664
The cult of personality already has

1991
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,968
Documents

1992
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
But he got the

1993
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,600
The Trump was lying to him the whole time

1994
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,880
Oh my God

1995
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,184
Tweet Paul Joseph Watson

1996
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,976
Believe believe

1997
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,792
He's been snake bitten on that one so I don't think it's

1998
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:36,352
He's not going to fall for that again

1999
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,400
You know it

2000
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
It's really f***** up we can

2001
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:43,264
Speculate all night long but we got a few more Clips we got to get through

2002
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,104
Is really f****** aware of

2003
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,640
He's doing

2004
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,432
In ways that we didn't realize

2005
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,712
Before because

2006
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Spell their

2007
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,272
Out

2008
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,064
So in this next clip

2009
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,160
Who is Michael Perry

2010
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:00,928
Back to them

2011
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,464
Earlier

2012
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,792
Comparison about Hitler

2013
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,608
Donald Trump

2014
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:18,080
I agree with him on vaccines

2015
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:22,944
Marjorie gross

2016
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
Mobile tracker

2017
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:39,072
What should happen to Trump political

2018
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,216
A shell

2019
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:51,616
Choo choo choo choo

2020
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,896
He's a smart guy

2021
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,432
He's even speculating

2022
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,784
Gnostic

2023
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,344
So he doesn't believe is a good guy

2024
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,368
So are we

2025
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,136
My pretties

2026
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,952
Alright cuz a lot of his beliefs don't match up with Nasi

2027
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
That's true

2028
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,256
It's just weird

2029
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,120
Cuz I cuz

2030
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,912
You don't know.

2031
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,192
In the

2032
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,728
The Gospels

2033
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,752
He's working with g

2034
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,616
Jesus wants him to give him up to the Romans

2035
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:32,320
And like imagine imagine is if there was a chance that Jesus didn't get

2036
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
Killed

2037
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,624
What was the religion

2038
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,648
That's true

2039
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,928
Like the whole thing has

2040
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
How to be a setup it was a game

2041
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,792
What is it called

2042
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,840
Alex and Rodger Stone

2043
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,680
Maybe they're in game

2044
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,704
To sacrifice Trump

2045
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,728
Much like Jesus

2046
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:55,360
Holyshit

2047
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
Cuz roll

2048
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896
Givenchy

2049
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,432
And then

2050
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,712
We get to watch

2051
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
Southgate Publix

2052
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:05,344
Crucified like an episode

2053
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,648
I said it would be

2054
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:12,512
I think your phone for good idea

2055
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,792
Stipulation of a trial

2056
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,096
Legal

2057
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:25,312
And I've gone but I've been going back and reading a lot of scripture as a 33-year old man

2058
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,848
How's it going

2059
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,384
It's interesting

2060
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,944
There's a lot of stuff that I I don't

2061
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,968
I didn't remember

2062
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,528
Angles

2063

I don't want to get too into it right now I'm not prepared to give my thesis

2064
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,280
This

2065
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,304
I'm going to get myself

2066
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,656
This next clip is

2067
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:54,752
One of the most inappropriate things I've ever heard on the show but not in a lake

2068
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,288
Horrifying way

2069
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,312
Just in a

2070
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,104
I'm not okay with this

2071
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:02,432
I'm really not okay with this

2072
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,712
Just a very uncool things

2073
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,552
Okay

2074
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,976
Christian in Texas are on the year of the Julia

2075
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,656
Neighbor takes my call

2076
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:27,776
About two years

2077
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,848
What are friends

2078

You know

2079
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,760
People who are 18 adults have the

2080
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:40,320
And it affects them

2081
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,928
Text Amanda no

2082
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,952
Custom

2083
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:54,144
You know about Donald Trump

2084
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:57,216
Noah seems like he is

2085
01:40:57,728 --> 01:41:00,288
Have a feeling

2086
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,592
If he does become president

2087
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
That

2088
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:09,504
Obama you know you went out there instead of going to take your shot

2089
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,600
Architecture semi-auto to look electronic do you

2090
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,648
So here we have a 40

2091
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,928
Ten-year-old calling in

2092
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,952
Infowars

2093
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:19,488
Who's been listening for 2 years

2094
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
Since he was 12

2095
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,816
Rights of a 6th grade

2096
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,584
He's a little

2097
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,120
Sing to this toxic garbage

2098
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,400
Who let him listen to

2099
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:30,240
So he

2100
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,288
Ostensibly I would assume

2101
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,056
Regularly

2102
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,336
He calls

2103
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:39,968
He just directly mirrors the opinions that Alex Jones expose RX bottles

2104
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:40,736
So

2105
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,528
You have a guy

2106
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
Who's calling in

2107
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
Who's not an adult

2108
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
His brain is still for me

2109
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,648
And it's clear

2110
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,280
Found impact on

2111
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:57,120
Absolutely doesn't understand the nuances of God

2112
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,168
How do you say

2113
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,752
You didn't do it

2114
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,824
You didn't do any of that stuff there still

2115
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:12,224
Obama is still in office

2116
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,016
This is so inappropriate

2117
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,808
If a fourteen-year-old

2118
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,088
Like tweeted at me

2119
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,624
They said they liked our show

2120
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,904
Kodiak leave

2121
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,184
Don't listen to the show

2122
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,000
Is even though I agree with the things I'm saying

2123
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,304
I don't have Ariel

2124
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,328
I would be like

2125
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,376
Alright you need to become a pilot

2126
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:41,152
18 year olds

2127
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,432
Because it's

2128
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:45,760
Super Immortals

2129
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,552
Culture

2130
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,600
Yeah no absolutely Alex Jones

2131
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,392
Response to the fourteen-year-old calling app

2132
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:54,464
Should be something along the lines of

2133
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,744
Hey dude

2134
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,280
You can't drive

2135
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,584
You can't see R-rated movies

2136
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,632
You should not be listening to my show

2137
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,936
There's a lot of content

2138
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,216
And you know

2139
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:09,824
I mean it's covered under free speech for the most part that everything he says

2140
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,128
It's not illegal to say but it is

2141
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,152
Their needs

2142
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,432
To be parental discretion

2143
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,200
Stop

2144
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,992
If you can't have a kid

2145
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,784
Listening to Chimera ship

2146
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,832
Cuz that kid can't research that

2147
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,672
He's not going to be able to figure out like the nuances of science

2148
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,696
And what Alex

2149
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:29,024
Was actually talking about

2150
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
And it's evident by the fact that he's just

2151
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,352
Mirror note

2152
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,400
Alex

2153
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,192
14 year old calls into

2154
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
What you talk about

2155
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,824
Good songs

2156
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,432
Chimeras of the heart

2157
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,968
I remember that

2158
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,016
I called into

2159
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:53,088
I told him that I have to attend to play The Mighty Mighty Bosstones

2160
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,136
That's what I called in for

2161
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,768
Y107

2162
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,816
Come over with all the radio stations

2163
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,864
We're back in Columbia

2164
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:08,704
I2i this is my big first radio

2165
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
But my break

2166
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:12,544
I always had a fairly deep

2167
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,824
Voice

2168
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
And so I called in

2169
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,152
Played the role of an adult

2170
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
I told the guy I like

2171
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
I'll give you my house

2172
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
My wife

2173
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
My car

2174
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,112
Cuz I do if I said something like that he

2175
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,440
And of course

2176
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:31,232
I'm sitting here listen to the radio

2177
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,000
And of course

2178
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,280
It's not nothing

2179
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,584
So he just recorded that music

2180
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
Play the impression that I get

2181
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,424
Hawking radiation

2182
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,472
Yukon

2183
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,776
No not really I just

2184
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,312
No Lie

2185
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:51,200
Because I never said I was just let him believe

2186
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,224
Be that as it may

2187
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:55,040
Connor's aren't like

2188
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,832
Nevermind this is what fourteen-year-old

2189
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:00,160
Not listening and I do not

2190
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,440
Support 14 year olds

2191
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,000
Listen to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones

2192
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:07,072
Supportive

2193
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,352
Mambo Number 5

2194
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:21,408
Where is the kid does have a good point

2195
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,456
Inasmuch as politics does effect

2196
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,272
But what happened

2197
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,552
Does Effexor

2198
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,832
People who are too young to vote

2199
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:29,856
That's a great point

2200
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Discussion

2201
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
How much should be had around that

2202
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,720
I don't know baby call Linda ellerbee

2203
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
Instead

2204
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,024
Host of Nick news

2205
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:40,864
If you don't do something like that. There's more appropriate venues

2206
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
4

2207
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,168
Getting kids involved

2208
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:43,936
In

2209
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,472
Expressing themselves

2210
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,752
Like Rock the vote

2211
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,312
Right things with art

2212
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,104
Anything

2213
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:51,872
That's not it

2214
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:53,920
Not done

2215
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,224
I hear you and God bless your question

2216
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:02,624
What perspective

2217
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,976
It's really it's really opened up my eyes and

2218
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,024
She was going on I mean I used to

2219
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,816
You know I didn't care

2220
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,120
Care for the news but I figured out that

2221
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,912
Yeah all this stuff is

2222
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,728
And that

2223
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,872
ONN training schools Army going to school I mean I realize that

2224
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:30,528
They're pretty much brainwashing that's ridiculous

2225
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:35,648
Feeling

2226
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:42,048
Good to hear from you appreciate your call Julia and Kentucky you're on the ear

2227
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,584
Excusable it's f***** up

2228
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120
Should not be

2229
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:47,680
Signing off on with a fourteen-year-old believe

2230
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,728
Especially not like

2231
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:50,752
Hey kid

2232
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:57,408
Don't believe that school you go to

2233
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:00,480
Do things that fill your brain with knowledge

2234
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:02,528
Maybe you're going to learn about math

2235
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:05,344
Maybe going to learn about maybe going to learn about literature

2236
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,112
Nope

2237
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,392
The doll

2238
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:11,488
Amiable

2239
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:13,792
Those things

2240
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,560
Is are good

2241
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,376
There are things that you shoot encouraging you

2242
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,680
Critical thinking skills

2243
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,984
Those are two things are absolutely good

2244
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,520
What's good

2245
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,080
Demonizing all authority figures

2246
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,640
The thing that they're trying to brainwash you

2247
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,176
That's not healthy

2248
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,480
Because when you grow up super paranoid

2249
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,016
Grow up with

2250
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
Perception

2251
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,832
Did anything that seems official

2252
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,880
Be trusted even come Eddie Bravo

2253
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,672
This is Young and brother

2254
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:47,072
We're going to mellow out

2255
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:50,144
Underlying pieces that Eddie Bravo in modern-day

2256
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,424
17 years old

2257
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,728
I don't know if I agree with

2258
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,008
But yeah

2259
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,544
That would be

2260
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:00,896
Right

2261
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
Bloodline all the time

2262
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:06,016
And they would get callers who were fairly Young

2263
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,064
And it was

2264
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,392
Or they have

2265
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,928
Concerns about

2266
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,952
And stuff like that

2267
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,488
And it's relevant to the show

2268
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,512
Right

2269
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,328
Adam Carolla did make a lot of jokes

2270
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,608
They always

2271
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,168
Tried to deal with people in a very sensitive

2272
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:27,776
Dr. Drew did a lot of a puke until he put in a lot of effort

2273
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,800
Into

2274
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:30,080
Understanding

2275
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,896
What your brain is like when your 14

2276
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:35,456
And not trying to f*** with that brain

2277
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,760
Right

2278
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,832
Super weird the fourteen-year-olds were calling to adult men at midnight

2279
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,416
It was super it was dealt with

2280
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,952
In a healthy

2281
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:48,256
And productive way

2282
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,536
It's not this

2283
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,072
This is

2284
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,656
I think it maybe should be illegal

2285
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:57,472
Sprouts to say those things to a fourteen-year-old

2286
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,520
That is a good question

2287
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:01,056
That is a really good question

2288
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:04,128
Is getting

2289
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:08,992
Like is it any media that you know

2290
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:12,320
Like I think you should be allowed to watch

2291
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:14,112
I know you're under the age of

2292
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:19,232
At alive atino that it it does it does introduce

2293
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:24,096
Shouldn't have brought up making it illegal or whatever setting

2294
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,656
In a perfect world where there's good parenting

2295
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,448
The kids should not be

2296
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,264
The f****** world went

2297
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,568
Crazy because they saw Janet Jackson

2298
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:38,176
Set 42 second year old is allowed to listen to this s***

2299
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:42,016
This is really demonstrative of what kids

2300
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:42,784
Should not be list

2301
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,232
Sport Clips

2302
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:57,120
Ferguson

2303
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,680
Cuz there is some police brutality

2304
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:09,152
What the feds are globalist occupy

2305
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,968
Run them into the arms of the globalist

2306
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,272
George soros's finding

2307
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:22,464
Tusker the shop and has really hard operators to do it

2308
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:29,376
Anamosa cases that justifiable shootings the police were engaged

2309
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,264
Police officers

2310
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:41,664
Nope

2311
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,040
Bigger than population in percent

2312
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,856
6%

2313
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,440
Disproportionate

2314
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:59,328
Stop right there. Right there

2315
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,912
Disease

2316
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:06,240
And it's just me just doesn't even show up on the scale

2317
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,776
Kids should not here

2318
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,056
Angles like

2319
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:12,896
They don't know how to parse the nuances that like that

2320
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:16,224
And realize where the LIE is where's the manipulation

2321
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:23,904
It's terrible that not human beings are not allowed to become human beings and it's terrible that old human beings are dying of

2322
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:24,928
S*** old

2323
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:25,952
People die of

2324
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,256
But you know it's not that bad that

2325
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,024
Young

2326
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:30,816
Men with

2327
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
Families

2328
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,376
Are being murdered

2329
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,424
Murdered and there are

2330
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,704
Consequence

2331
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:42,848
4-H

2332
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,664
They are being indicted

2333
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,944
So it's not

2334
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,272
If this system in his head where it all works out

2335
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:53,856
It doesn't it does not work out angry about

2336
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:58,720
He's fully aware there again in the same way that it's a revelation that he's aware

2337
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:03,072
That the Tea Party is susceptible to Fascism right he just said right there

2338
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:05,376
Fully aware that statistically

2339
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,400
Black men

2340
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,168
Orbeez

2341
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,448
Killed by the police

2342
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,216
In

2343
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:14,080
Very anomalous numbers still denied

2344
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,128
Racism really exist

2345
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:18,688
He's never seen white people being racist

2346
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:21,248
How do you reconcile

2347
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:24,320
I actually think his next clip actually help

2348
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:27,904
I think we might be able to reconcile

2349
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:32,256
It explains

2350
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,560
Some of

2351
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,840
His inability to think

2352
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:46,080
Let me shoot video I shoot

2353
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
For some reason

2354
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:56,064
1 shots

2355
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:05,792
Shooting 308 AR-15

2356
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:09,120
Huge boxes

2357
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,728
While I'm talking a couple of blow up

2358
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:16,544
Center block flying around

2359
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:23,968
One-armed headstand that's why I don't think I do.

2360
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:29,088
He's walking brain damage

2361
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
Yeah

2362
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:33,952
Maybe that's why he has the inability to integrate information

2363
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,720
He's

2364
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,768
Gmate literally be brain-dead

2365
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:39,840
You stuck under a house inhaling fumes as a child

2366
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:41,632
He said that he got his head

2367
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,912
Smashed around knocked in the

2368
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,448
The concrete when he was young

2369
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:47,008
When selling a story about

2370
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:47,776
Shooting

2371
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
Explosives

2372
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,824
And a cinder block

2373
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:50,592
I'm flying out of

2374
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,896
Explosion

2375
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,176
Serious

2376
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,320
Shoot kill you

2377
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:05,440
So we figured it out there's the above all of Alex Jones right here

2378
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:11,328
Synthesized into one person

2379
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:12,864
Who just is on

2380
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,936
Able to really deal with what facts are

2381
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,472
He doesn't know how to read

2382
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,520
Probably get some of his brain damage

2383
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:21,824
So he reads things he assumes the worst

2384
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:24,384
He thinks his people are winking at him

2385
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:30,784
Long article

2386
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:35,392
Talking to ghost

2387
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,416
It's a call this is

2388
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:41,792
Is just a man like we have a grand unified field theory of Alex

2389
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:45,888
Yeah

2390
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,424
Futbin

2391
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,216
Even if you have brain damage

2392
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,264
Like there are moments

2393
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,032
Lucidity

2394
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,312
And maybe

2395
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,640
These moments

2396
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,176
Inside about Trump

2397
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:00,736
And the inevitable slide into fascism

2398
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,528
The vest

2399
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,576
Images of his brain that works

2400
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,112
And maybe

2401
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,648
Baby

2402
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,952
Taking all of these supplements

2403
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:16,864
It killed the rest of the brain that worked at possible

2404
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:23,264
Ironically be a Flowers for Algernon for 200,000

2405
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,288
Mouse-brain

2406
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,872
Clips

2407
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,176
From August

2408
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:33,248
Rights and like I said earlier we got the

2409
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:35,296
Perspective of Jojo

2410
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,088
The employee of Infowars

2411
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,112
School

2412
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:39,136
Things to say about Trump

2413
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:41,952
Alex wants to ask

2414
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:45,792
Naturalnews.com

2415
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
Assignment

2416
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,288

Write these blogs on naturalnews.com

2419
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,664
Did Alex reports on it

2420
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,712
Clarify

2421
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:09,344
Recycle it is a vicious propaganda

2422
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,112
Confirmation

2423
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,136
Absolute

2424
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:12,416
Not even close

2425
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:16,000
Sitting in

2426
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,792
Studio is back in the control booth

2427
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,608
Disrespected about Trump

2428
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:27,008
At the same time it's like

2429
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,312
Pain

2430
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,848
2

2431
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,408
He's going and being real

2432
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:37,504
People white people

2433
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:46,208
Even if he's not genuine the appearance of genuine

2434
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,488
Miss King

2435
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,792
Another

2436
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:59,008
He screams now all the time about how I'm real

2437
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,592
I don't know proceeding Foundation

2438
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:07,456
This is such a this is such a weird twisting and turning investigation

2439
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,480
It's bananas

2440
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:12,064
Explain a whole lot

2441
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,112
To the heart of it

2442
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,136
Crowdsource

2443
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:22,304
Compulsory

2444
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:25,632
We like Alex Jones

2445
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,680
We will get on auto-ship

2446
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:32,032
If you submit to a brain scan

2447
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:38,432
Will even buy one of each color of those t-shirts that never got made

2448
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:42,528
That actually sounds like a fun chart if you get checked

2449
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,296
Out

2450
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:44,832
You won't do it though

2451
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,600
No

2452
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:46,624
I better yet

2453
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:51,488
Yeah I bet he has memory loss I bet he's talking

2454
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,096
You know

2455
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,632
Weymouth

2456
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:02,496
You are a reverse injected

2457
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,336
Traumas to your head

2458
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,616
When you're younger

2459
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,640
It makes a

2460
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,920
Impact

2461
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:10,944
When you're older

2462
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,480
As opposed to when you're like

2463
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:15,296
20in get hit around the head a little bit it's not so bad

2464
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,344
But he talks about these

2465
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
Rites of Passage

2466
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:19,904
Rinaldi's

Which is

2471
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,280
Sweet spot

2472
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,912
Concerned about people who play football

2473
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:36,032
In like junior high or High School

2474
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:40,640
For the rest of your life

2475
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,712
I mean

2476
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,504
Really looks like

01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,784

2489
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:05,728
This astronaut got in touch with me

2490
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:07,776
His name is a big deal

2491
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,824
Okay that's right. InTouch

2501
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:31,584

Alex Jones going to be in later

2505
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:43,616
Skip the interview

2506
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,384

2507
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,664
To his interview

2508
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:47,968
StoryBots

2509
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,736
Grave

2510
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,344
If that is an astronaut

2511
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,136
That name should be all over NASA

2512
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,464
Is he a liar

2513
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,744
He's legit

2514
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,280
Okay I looked it up

2515
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,120
He was involved with designing

2516
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:05,888
Space Station

2517
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,496
He's done a lot of missions in space

2518
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:11,520
Super legit

2519
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,568
How did it go

2520
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,872
Well it's can't go well

2521
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:18,176
I want to give you a couple of important

2522
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,576
He's ninety if he's a day

2523
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:29,184
He has been retired for 18 years

2524
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,744
Alright Alex think

2525
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,280
But he's calling in

2526
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:36,352
To give him some big info on the secret space program

2527
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,888
And s*** like that

2528
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:40,960
The wonders of

2529
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:41,728
Space

2530
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:45,056
He does he does tell him like about how great spaces

2531
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:47,616
You talked about how

2532
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,896
Perception of the Earth

2533
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:53,760
Changes when you're outside of Earth that I look down on it

2534
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:56,576
Yeah that whole thing you hear from every astronaut their light

2535
02:00:56,832 --> 02:01:02,720
All of your troubles seem so small when you look at the Grand scale see the universe everything is

2536
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:03,488
Is it

2537
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:06,560
Is much bigger yeah we need to make sure we defund that

2538
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:09,632
Otherwise people will get that kind of perspective

2539
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:11,424
Alex is trying to

2540
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,472
Trying to lead him down bro.

2541
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:14,752
That would reveal

2542
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,824
Conspiracies

2543
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,688
Tip sort of talk about how great

2544
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,224
His career

2545
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,552
How how interesting space travel is and how

2546
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,344
Wants to encourage people

2547
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,112
To dream

2548
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,904
And wants to tell his story

2549
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:35,488
He's awesome

2550
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,768
Fuckingawesome

2551
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:37,792
Alex

2552
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,840
The whole time

2553
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
Hands like

2554
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,704
No

2555
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,752
He finally got a genuinely in

2556
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,800
Aspiring message

2557
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:53,664
F*** this the guy talks about how human monsters need inspiration

2558
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,480
Story Musgrave is telling talkin about how like

2559
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:59,552
When he was a boy he had to drop out of school to work

2560
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,088
And he was like

2561
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:04,160
Properly educated as a child

2562
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:04,928
Went back to

2563
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,208
Became a doctor

2564
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,744
And then gotten

2565
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,072
The space as I recall

2566
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,096
He

2567
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,936
Space Voyages of any

2568
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:17,984
America

2569
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,056
He's telling this super inspirational awesome story

2570
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:27,456
But I did it's not the interview he thought it was

2571
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:29,760
Most interesting thing that you can pause

2572
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:30,528
Possibly run

2573
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:33,600
Yeah I don't have clips of the actual interview cuz

2574
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:34,880
It's really visual

2575
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:35,904
Like Alex is this

2576
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,696
Disappointment is supervision

2577
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:40,768
But I want to play the beginning of the interview

2578
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:46,400
And then the end of the interview but he does kind of rush out of it

2579
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,168
Is

2580
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,192
Gorgeous

2581
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:51,008
Again this is Mike down situation

2582
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:57,920
This cannot be the future via Skype

2583
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:01,248

And now I'm going to let her go now she's going to go back to the Tractor so she drives track

2590
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:25,056
After she got her own ATV

That's all that's just adorable raising her the way she'll be ready for the

02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:55,936
Never really watched

2610
02:04:56,704 --> 02:05:01,824
Listen to the show

2611
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:04,640
That's where Alex Alex

2612
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,432
Turn

2613
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:12,064
This guy contacted us

2614
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:15,392
He's going to teach us as a whistleblower I like that

2615
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:18,720
And the reality is I bet there he was in Austin

2616
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:27,168
Go on a TV show

2617
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,752
But it is not

2618
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:36,128
I wish we were a video show

2619
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,664
Just so people could see the looking

2620
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,688
His face when

2621
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:40,224
Story Musgrave asked

2622
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:42,272
Are you in Austin Bass

2623
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:47,392
Your audience mostly in Austin is like Alex Ison

2624
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:49,696
Balls cut off

2625
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:57,120
Cuz he knows that he's getting emasculated in front of his own audience tonight I'm going to get Musgrave up

2626
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:05,056
There's not much else about Trump in the 11

2627
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:09,408
That Musgrave shed

2628
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,688
Beautiful

2629
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:13,504
Play plan I could listen to that all day

2630
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,320
Is adorable

2631
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:19,392
And get this

2632
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,416
He asked them again

2633
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:25,536
Worldwide server

2634
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:31,936
He's adorable throughout the entire interview is great

2635
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,544
That is

2636
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,592
Well first off

2637
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:41,920
When you say Alex Jones says he has a

2638
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:42,944
Huge Astro

2639
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:43,968
On the show

2640
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,272
First thing I think is going to be a fact

2641
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:50,112
I don't know why that happened that happened

2642
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,136
This guy

2643
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:56,256
Like he's just like wandering around

2644
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:59,328
Thinking like he saw Good Will Hunting me by

2645
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:05,984
Game is what exactly

2646
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,288
Surely awesome

2647
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,848
Who's accomplished

2648
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:12,896
More than Alex Jones could ever

2649
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:13,664
Dream

2650
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:20,320
And the angle of Alex's lying about building

2651
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:23,392
Everett

2652
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:28,768
I actually wish I had more clips of it because they would be a really interests

2653
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:29,536
In case study

2654
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:31,584
Into how terrible an interviewer out

2655
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,728
6 times at point-blank range

2656
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,008
And she survived

2657
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,896
He doesn't want to get to the details

2658
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:47,712
In the same way you can see him being really frustrated

2659
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:50,272
B story Musgrave doesn't want to give him any global

2660
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:54,368
He wants to just talk about how great math is and how important

2661
02:07:54,624 --> 02:08:00,256
It's monstrous program but you could get a lot of really into

2662
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:03,328
Stories out of him with your Theisen interviewer and Alex

2663
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:06,400
This isn't there to play games

2664
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:08,192
Disappointed

2665
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:12,544
That would have been such a beautiful spot just like

2666
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,080
Just nothing but

2667
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,616
Racism

2668
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:18,944
Globalist in all of the ship

2669
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,992
And then for one brief Shining Moment

2670
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,016
If the promise

2671
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:22,784
Subspace

2672
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,064
Sure beautiful

2673
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:24,832
Could be

2674
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:25,600
But

2675
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:29,184
Only four dimensions

2676
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,208
Yeah

2677
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:33,024
The same thing with just the other day in 27

02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,864

2679

Had a huge crush on

2686
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:57,088
True damage

2687
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:12,960
That's what Sonic Crush -2.5 friend

2688
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:13,984
This girl

2689
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:18,848
Well here's the thing it's actually really f***** up

2690
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,872
So I have this like

2691
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:22,176
Childish crush on the girl on Earth 2

2692
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:25,248
I had these like sort of fantasies

2693
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,016
Of us being

2694
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:29,344
Friends and running around Earth two together and discovering stuff

2695
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,952
That's the version of a crush

2696
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:37,536
Pippi Longstocking

2697
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:40,096
Corso

2698
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,728
When I got older

2699
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,008
I think it was in college

2700
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,544
Iced I remembered

2701
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,616
And it's been

2702
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:54,432
Memory of a childish Crush

2703
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:57,248
And then go back as an older person

2704
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:02,880

02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:07,744

2709
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:18,752
Giving up

Become a teacher and then just

2711
