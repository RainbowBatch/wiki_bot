Do not give a fux

8
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,432
Situation

9
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,760
While back

From St lunatics

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
We're going to st. Louis

18
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
To do a show

19
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
And we're driving on the way

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Absolutely

21
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
We were heading to

22
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:12,096
Let's see if any st. Louis celebrities will come to the show

23
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
Of course we ended up getting into the other sink

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,728
And it was great

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
He was dropping

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
Remember was

27
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
Don't nobody love these hoes

28
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
But Everybody Loves Raymond

29
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,112
What is that mean I don't know

30
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,184
There's a show where I know a couple of tweets

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
And I

32
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Good

33
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,192
Jordan today we were doing is we're in the present we going over the span of August 4th and 5th

34
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,032

35
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Of the

Shootings in El Paso

37
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:01,248
So it won't be as awful as that sounds like it's going

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Cuz I don't

39
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
I guess what I'm trying to

40
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
Spring out here is

41
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Like I think that if you're particularly sensitive

42
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
These topics

43
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Proceed with caution

44
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
I don't know if

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
As horrible as you're going to imagine

46
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
The concept

47
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
Recover will be

48
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,032
I don't know I could be entirely often terms

49
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
People

50
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Experience

51
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Think so anyway fair warning

52
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
I guess it is

53
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
That's a headline

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
Get into that it's interesting to

55
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
How narratives

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
The built

57
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Crisis mode

58
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
And in real time

59
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,512
And I'm excited to go over all of that but first

60
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144

66
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
Nora's

Neither

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
Although

00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,904
This guy probably at some other great

Apology

78

Because I mispronounced their name before

79
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
First time I saw it was

80
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Exactly

81
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,367
Grove

82
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,975

Freakishly large

86
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Grove

87
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Zlatan full movie

88
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Take all of you very very much

89
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
Appreciate it

90
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Jordan

91
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
Interesting

92
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
I've been really

93
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
I was struck with a really into

94
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
Christina thought while I was going through a lot of

95
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
And one of the things that I wanted

96
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
Almost

97
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Idea or thought

98
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
The Haven our minds is

99
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
As we go through this

100
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
Question

101
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
It's been taken over by

102
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Conspiracy theorist

103
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Then people who

104
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
Often times people down bad roads

105
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,239
Well

106
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
You know what is

107
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
What if

108
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
And that leads you down the road

109
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Considering

110
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Possibly

111
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
You know

112
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Wise sources

113
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
He leads you down a bad Road

114
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
I want it I want it

115
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
Hold on to that idea of what if

116
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Particularly in terms of hours

117
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
What's Jones

118
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
What if

119
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
He's wrong

120
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
You know like for himself

121
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
What is that mean he's doing

122
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
You know if we're wrong

123
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
What does that mean

124
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
That means

125
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Well first of all Alex

126
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
Needs to show me you needs to prove any of this point

127
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,223
I'm willing to be wrong real world consequence does it have if we're wrong

128
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,087
Aaron's

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
Start caring about other people

130
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
And become a

131
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,767
Right or correct

132
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,399
Maybe we would be negligent

133
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,543
We're going to be able to do anything about that or anybody listening

134
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
So there's that

135
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
What is Alex

136
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Is wrong

137
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
He is

138
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
I wasn't Charis

139
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
I want to hold on to that question as we go along

140
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
And just let it ruminate

141
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Things only 2.0

142
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Before we get started

143
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Is that I've been noticing in the present day that Alex Jones

144
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
A f****** cat

145
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Catchphrase

146
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
But he's working on

147
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
Did I do that

148
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
Evict Tony delivers it is kind of the same mystery

149
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
Supercut of him saying his catchphrase

150
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
From these two days up

151
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
She at work

152
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,247
How it works that works

153
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,831
So he

154
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
Condescendingly Africa

155
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:00,767
Oh my God all the time

156
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
Yeah so I'm going to keep track of them

157
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Running

158
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Track of the see how that works

159
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
So we can see how it works

160
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
So we start on the 4th was Sunday

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,847
You were courts in the evening time

162
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
426

163
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
So by that point

164
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
He has every reason to

165
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
To be aware of both shoe

166
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,855
He does not seem to be aware aware of

167
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
The care all that much about the date

168
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
On the 4th

169
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Almost the entire thing

170
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
Is about a female Paso

171
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
I don't know why that's the case

172
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm not entirely sure if you

173
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Probably unwise

174
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Speculate

175
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
But just so everyone's wherever almost everything you talk about

176
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
For this first

177
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
August 4th

178
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
He's about

179
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
I told he starts

180
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
Ready

181
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Need to get into

182
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
Speculative

183
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
I'm going to create a can

184
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Conspiracy mode

185
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
He needs to justify that

186
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
He needs to justify Behavior

187
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
People rightfully call him out all the time

188
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
About how what he does really f***** up

189
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Until he does that buy a peeling

190
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
History

191
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,959
Starbucks

192
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
Iran air

193
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
Check 500,000 children as a good price

194
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Toupee

195
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Cutting off their medicine

196
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,295
Bill Clinton did George Herbert Walker

197
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
They would never wind up a leftist to carry out of

198
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
So

199
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
We already have the insinuation

200
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
The shooter in El Paso was the last

201
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Which will develop is

202
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Time goes on

203
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Why shouldn't we question

204
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Something

205
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Madeleine Albright

206
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,455
The killed a bunch of kids were a good like a good price

207
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,927
Start the show has me really worried

208
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:12,095
Relying on an argument it's flimsy is Madeleine Albright said something really sucked up 23 years ago so obviously

209
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
False flag shooting

210
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
Like he's got much to go on

211
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
Is that the opening volley

212
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
Yeah well it is unimpeachable logic

213
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,175
Madeleine Albright

214
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,551
Express

215
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
That's a horrible thing

216
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Shouldn't have said that

217
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
And it's also Madeleine Albright's position

218
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Alex always plays that clip of her little tiny clip from the 60 Minutes interview

219
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
And guilt better comments leichter

220
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
She said in her book Madam Secretary quote

221
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,871
Little effort was made to explain saddam's culpability his misuse of Rocky resources

222
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,455
Or the fact that we were not in bargaining medicine or food

223
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
I was exasperated that our TV was showing what amounted to a rack

224
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
P propaganda

225
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,183
I must have been crazy I should have answered the question by reframing it and pointing out the inherent flaws in the premise behind it

226
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,535
Saddam Hussein could have prevented any child from suffering

227
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
I said the following

228
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
I think it's a very hard choice but the price we think

229
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
The prices worth it

230
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
As soon as I'd spoken I wish for the power to freeze time and take back my words

231
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
I replied but a terrible mistake

232
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Hasty clumsy and wrong

233
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
Nothing matters more than the lives of Ennis

234
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
I've fallen into a trap and said something that I simply did not me

235
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
This is nobody's fault but my own

236
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
It's interesting to me

237
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
Me because take whatever you like Peter bad out of here

238
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,095
It's really hard for me the most apologize for incorrect

239
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Statements

240
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Made by politician

241
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Can think of

242
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
Always been very clear that you didn't make

243
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Disappointed

244
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
That she wishes she could take it back

245
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
You find so many times you criticized

246
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Yourself like from her own book

247
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,271
Amy Goodman bum-rushed at the 2004 Democratic National Convention

248
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
She been very clear about

249
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
It just kind of wild to be that Alex takes

250
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
This is proof of exactly what he wants

251
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
Be proof up by depriving it of

252
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
And any of Albright's later statement or she tries to clarify what

253
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
It means what Alex

254
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Send it meme

255
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Because this show is about constructing a narrative

256
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,055
Also it's hilarious to be that I would spend so much time discussing a horrible Madeleine Albright's comments

257
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Powerbox

258
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,919
What are supporting Trump sanctions on Venezuela

259
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,247
A legit talking about a block hate to push for regime change their

260
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Would you be devastated

261
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
Play screen active War but

262
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Because globalist

263
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
Yeah I'm pretty sure blockades only ever

264
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
It's it it's a real aggressive act

265
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
I mean

266
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Right on I don't know what

267
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
You could say right

268
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Why would

269
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,175
Why would you and then think that you get any mileage out of playing a clip of Madeleine Albright Mystic months

270
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
It's important that

271
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Justify

272
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Ahead of time what

273
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
He knows he's about to

274
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
To do

275
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,743
So if I'm going to get into Rec speculation about the

276
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
That have happened then I'm going to

277
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Need to be like well do this stuff

278
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
So that's what he's doing

279
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
It is interesting to me that

280
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Think of any

281
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Star Wars movie where Alex

282
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
Isn't probably on the bad guy

283
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,551
He's already on

284
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,135
That's why I always play The Imperial March

285
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
So we've already got a horribly out of context

286
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Clip of Madeleine Albright

287
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Vacation

288
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
4

289
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
His narrative

290
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
It's really funny to me that this is what he say

291
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
You want us to break down

292
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Current climate

293
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
Current system brand

294
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
You found the right

295
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
That's what you

296
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Really

297
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Exactly what's going on

298
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
In El Paso

299
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
But I

300
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Dunno

301
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,047
That the media is using the crisis try to cause a race war in this country

302
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Corporate media

303
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
Has been

304
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Pushing

305
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
Massive massive massive

306
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
Cultural

307
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Division

308
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
There's been a

309
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Mulan

310
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Flash

311
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
For that

312
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Non-Stop

313
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Continually

314
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,367
So it's interesting to me that he says that I don't know what's going on

315
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
I do know that

316
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
Yeah it's it's amazing

317
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
That we do this

318
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Because that means that you can

319
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Continued list

320
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
Point where is if it were me or a right

321
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
It'd be like

322
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
The meaning of trying to start a race war

323
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Clips

324
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
And everybody

325
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Fordham law

326
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Crypto globalist

327
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Clemente's

328
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Jordan

329
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
That's dumb

330
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
Sarcastic

331
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
If you hear me sarcastic during Alex

332
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,919
Beto O'Rourke motorist album

333
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
They're totally capitalizing on Atlanta president

334
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,111
When you can clearly blame the Democrats if you believe the official story

335
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
About what's happened here

336
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,999
B foaming all of this up and making it about race war

337
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047
Trump's comment about race

338
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Color where you from

339
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Beholder

340
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Always sing

341
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
That is involved

342
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
But you're

343
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
Hundred thousand dead children

344
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Trumpsta Blaine

345
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
She went on to blame their all the blame

346
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
Are all the blame

347
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
How illustrating is that

348
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,807
I'm really shocked you didn't and we'll see how that works

349
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
I cannot believe that it's pretty close

350
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
What he feels is justifying

351
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Lake

352
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
He knows what he's doing

353
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Part of me that doesn't

354
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Like no

355
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
I guess I can't be a hundred percent certain

356
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
I've learned from studying Alex Jones make me

357
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
Very confident

358
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
He enters the studio

359
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Producing manipulative

360
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Narrative

361
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
About real-world events

362
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
He knows that's what he

363
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
He's doing and in order

364
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
I feel like

365
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
This is just

366
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
Dubai to make it look like that's not what he's doing

367
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,935
Madeleine Albright singing this

368
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
They don't care about human life because of this

369
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Now I'm cool

370
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
I don't know if I'm

371
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
Become more mature fur I'm just old

372
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Fire and

373
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Hatred

374
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
In my head

375
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Instead of screaming them

376
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Because

377
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Once he started talk

378
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
I swear to God

379
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,263
Use your the a level of neighbors that you would have to yell back at me

380
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
You've got a tough day ahead

381
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Is it going to be

382
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
I'm listening to this and I'm gone doesn't sound like

383
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,903
He woke up and was super stoked

384
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
To go on

385
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Joann

386
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
Justify

387
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,607
Terrorism

388
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Word like

389
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Good morning filled with like

390
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,311
Tell people a white nationalist terrorism

391
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Not a prob

392
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
It was it's just

393
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Disgusting

394
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Him

395
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Maybe he's just a little

396
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Recorded

397
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
16 minute of media

398
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Report

399
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
On Saturday

400
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
It already like

401
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,767
Worked on his day off was a little excited

402
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,863
Halfway expected him to pop champagne just like a

403
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
16 election

404
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
F****** laugh

405
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
Well we'll see where it goes

406
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
There's a there's another thing that he needs

407
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
To do it like

408
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Just believe

409
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Cloister

410
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
Himself

411
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Blanket

412
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
About his behavior

413
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
It's clear like

414
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Paint the globalist

415
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
He's blaming

416
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
For all of this

417
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
Heartless not caring about human life

418
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
Totally demonic

419
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,375
Phone do that with the Madeleine Albright

420
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Then you have to defend

421
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
Against the idea that

422
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,543
This person who committed the actual crime

423
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Could have been

424
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Motivated by

425
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
From your conversation

426
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,295
And you can do that by also sort of blame

427
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
You know why I question

428
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,487
Mass shootings real mass shootings happen

429
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,863
Shooting

430
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Superstars

431
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:33,407
In the old days it was before

432
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,695
Is in criminology manuals it to give it stop psychology

433
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
This is well-known information

434
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
Place within a few days

435
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
Operate

436
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,855
Hundreds of movies and thousands of TV reports every year and just newspaper articles

437
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
About

438
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,280
Suicide by cop just just

439
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,888
So what he's talking about is a real thing

440
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Kind of clothes

441
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Describing a real

442
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:39,456
Found where media coverage of notable suicides people to emulate the circumstances

443
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
No suicide

444
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
This is called the worth of

445
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,320
Named after a character in gurthaz book

446
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
The Sorrows of young Werther

447
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,928
In the book where there is rejected in love intuitive

448
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,024
After the book's release there were reports of young man emulating worth her

449
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
How much of that reporting is

450
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Sensationalized

451
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Itself

452
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
Connecting disconnected cases

453
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
The book it was the late 1700s after all

454
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,752
It's hard to say with certain

455
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
See how much of that

456
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,896
Accurate whatever the case of phenomenon was named in history has shown that

457
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,968
To be a bit of a connection between high-profile suicides and rise

458
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Suicide rate

459
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
This is scene after Robin Williams took his life

460
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,624
Research was almost 10% increase in suicide

461
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
Over what their model would have predicted

462
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,976
This is something that's really almost

463
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
Is it possible to prove a causal link

464
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,864
There's no way that demonstrating interesting patterns

465
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
It seemed to indicate that

466
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,960
Suicide numbers go up after them

467
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
There's no way

468
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
Definitively say that's what's

469
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Causing it

470
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,640
There's a ton of other variable that could be influencing that pattern they're impossible to

471
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
Control4 in any ethical experiment

472
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,736
Alex wants to take the position

473
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
The coverage of a suicide does trigger copycats

474
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
I'm not going to fight him too much on it

475
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
It's worth pointing out however that studies

476
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:57,024
Determine if this effect apply to fictionalize portray

477
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Inconclusive

478
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
Ungrounded

479
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,008
TV shows where the writes favorite video game

480
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
Have any bearing on causing disorder copycat Behavior

481
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,224
In an article in Scientific American said that this phenomenon doesn't seem to apply to TV and movies because quote

482
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,808
It does appear the public-at-large are able to distinguish fact from fiction

483
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
Which we know the struggle for Alec

484
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
Is she with you though is that you

485
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
Baker supply to all phenomena

486
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
Which I don't think he's in any way Statler

487
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:34,400
If we take his accepted the high-profile suicide can have an effect on suicide rates

488
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
Maybe the aftermath of news reports about it

489
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
It doesn't follow that this phenomenon

490
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
It's for Mass shooters

491
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,872
It very well may but the resorts that he's using to justify his claim. Suicides

492
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
It does not extend to mass shooters

493
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
You have not earned the right to make

494
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
Is based solely on his own access

495
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,648
I find the evidence to be pretty overwhelming that there is a copycat phenomenon going on

496
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,768
But I don't believe it's appropriate

497
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
It's seen as it

498
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Suicide

499
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,704
When you make that simplistic and unfounded what you're doing is attempting to whitewash all the other motivations

500
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
The shooter may have had

501
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,872
None of them matter because all they were doing is there's another suicidal go shoot up some place

502
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
That is nsnsn

503
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
The sort of behavior you would expect out of someone

504
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Conducting a cover-up

505
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,392
Not because they were involved in the shooting or anything like that because

506
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
They put into the world

507
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,024
Beyond anything else I find Alex's position on this

508
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
To be absurd

509
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
And downright

510
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,168
If he believes that media coverage of things make them more likely to be copy catter

511
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
Why does he spend so much time salacious

512
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
Covering any crime and immigrant

513
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Isn't he worried that

514
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
He'll call the copycat immigrant crime

515
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,152
Is if you still worried about this phenomenon why is he obsessed about the

516
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Thredup

517
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,992
Isn't he concerned that cause copycat

518
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
We carries out his broadcast doesn't support the ark

519
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
He's absolutely fine engaging in the exact

520
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
Academica media for in every

521
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
Go other circumstance

522
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
That doesn't involve gun violence

523
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
And there's a very easy to figure out reason why

524
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
So

525
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,920
You got this deflection you got you got this framing with Madeleine Albright quote

526
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
You've got this

527
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
Deflection with

528
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
Misinterpretation of The copier

529
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
Affect

530
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Experience

531
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
And then what you need to do if you need to

532
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
To minimize

533
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Sure

534
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
But it's not

535
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
So

536
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,064
Uno Alex playing fast and loose here a little bit I think

537
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,440
Thousands of people are killed in Cancun a week

538
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Which is completely insane

539
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
They're 540 murders

540
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
In Cancun in 2018

541
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
To be comfortable but it's far less

542
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Thousands a week

543
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,008
Maybe there's thousands of murders a week in Mexico that's even absurd number

544
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,640
There were 30 3341 murders investigations open did Mexico in

545
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,456
2018 approximately 641 a week

546
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
Again that's a much higher number than we would like to

547
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,600
Alex's embellishment of these things is super

548
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,464
Thousands of murders a week in Cancun Mexico as a whole

549
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
Exaggerated image of what's going on

550
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
In that country

551
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,680
Ironically if he believes that there were thousands of murders a week and a city in Mexico or just Mexico

552
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,520
He's even more of a complete monster for opposing people they can Refugee claim

553
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
But that's a separate issue then

554
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
Furthermore

555
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,200
It's kind of expensive to say that the media doesn't talk about the violence

556
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Kartel crime

557
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,088
From my perspective I see plenty of coverage of it

558
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
Equivalent by making exaggerated completely untrue Claim about the murders in Mexico

559
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Is what the media should be covering

560
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Simply is away deflecting

561
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,144
Sing for people having a conversation about gun violence in our country

562
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,984
And again it's pretty simple to see why he would do that

563
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
Oye complain about El Paso

564
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Or whatever it is

565
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
It's a strategy

566
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Inherently a tree

567
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
It makes it so no matter how you reply you either get bogged down into an unwinnable conversation that the person who's trying to bait you

568
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,848
They also do not care about that at all

569
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Don't care about people for income

570
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,224
Batteries dying

571
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Even passion

572
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
It's the only way to win

573
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Perhaps

574
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
So I we get to the big narrative

575
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
Now in this

576
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
This is what's going to guide Alex

577
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
His belief that this is a false flag

578
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
The El Paso shooting

579
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
Was set up by the club

580
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
Another using a

581
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
Trump rally

582
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
All that good stuff

583
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,664
Adidas shoes

584
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,248
Sure could be

585
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
It will be

586
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
The underpin

587
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,208
I'll tell this point we've got all of the preparation that's

588
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
Needed in order to justify this sort of behavior

589
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
This is the behavior

590
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Donald Trump

591
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,472
Donald Trump Alex Jones

592
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
Paul Joseph Watson

593
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
Within hours of the shooting

594
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,392
Social media shellylike Alex Jones and qanon

595
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
I noticed it was confirmed it

596
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
Psychologist

597
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,016
They were removing was a Democrat

598
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Removing

599
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,976
I would say that

600
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Alex's

601
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,656
Eager to be Associated remember when you said earlier than that

602
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
I really wish I got more headlines that I was involved

603
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,456
Stuff in the conversation Donald Trump

604
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,272
Nkwen on

605
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,832
Even if there's a loose connection between yourself

606
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
Shooter like you was your fan

607
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
There's a way to cover that with

608
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
This is not

609
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,512
To deny that the shooter was his

610
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Spy

611
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
Event creating a greater

612
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
Christian top of the whole thing places

613
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,680
Focus squarely on himself

614
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,776
This is a strategy to make himself the real victim of the shooting more or less

615
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,080
Which is a monstrous behavior and something you should be

616
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
I really wanted to get to the bottom of this

617
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,200
To see if there's any truth to what Alex was saying

618
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
But I didn't buy ability to do so because there wasn't coverage of the Social Media stuff on Infowars website

619
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Is really where you think the proof would be

620
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,720
If this was a conspiracy that Alex is going to put out on his show

621
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
I get there was nothing

622
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Have you found there

623
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
It took a little bit of digging but I figured out

624
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
What was up

625
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
This is the story about the shooters

626
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
MyLife page

627
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:08,800
For those of you who don't know my life is a website that uses publicly available information about people to create profiles of them

628
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
It's super f***** up

629
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,384
And I hate that

630
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Wait

631
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Wait

632
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Wait

633
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
It's just a

634
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Data aggregator that creates

635
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
The profile

636
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,672
For you

637
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,768
So we can make a profile regardless of whether or not you've ever heard

638
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
I believe so

639
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
After the shooting the relegation

640
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,728
Did someone have gone into this political affiliation

641
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
From Democrat to Republican

642
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
They further added references to MB

643
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,128
Qanon believer and NRA supporter and an incel

644
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
Obviously

645
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,688
This was the work of left

646
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,504
Try to cover up that this guy was one of them

647
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,112
And then they're going to leave Noble the noble Donald Trump holding the bag

648
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Sure

649
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:59,232
The problem is that the shooter didn't even have a profile on my life until after the shooting

650
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,560
When was made for him in the right after the first

651
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,936
News broke with his identity and when it was first put up there was no political affiliation listed

652
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
After that

653
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
To say that he was a Democrat

654
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
With no evidence provided

655
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,872
They also put his religious beliefs and ethnicity is ant

656
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
People started at it again

657
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,272
To say that he was a Republican and honestly from their got even Wilder

658
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
People's cab

659
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah this became a Wikipedia

660
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:31,488
Entry Beach National Heroes

661
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:37,888
Decided to stop following the edit profile

662
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Democratic political affiliation

663
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Action was listed as Republic

664
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:49,408
This is a case of dumb dumb

665
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
They wanted to sit

666
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:56,064
My wife is a super easily edited website and they explicitly say about the information on the site quote

667
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
We cannot fully guarantee its accuracy

668
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,488
The point here is that even an ideal circumstances my life is not a place where real information

669
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Should be pulled from

670
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
Unless I can be verified elsewhere

671
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,888
Alex's pretending vets

672
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,960
Prescribed

673
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Portray him as an

674
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
That was

675
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
He's reporting

676
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
The second part but not the

677
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
The first

678
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Because Alex Jones

679
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
He loves narrative

680
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,968
It doesn't matter if they're true

681
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
It just matters if they sell

682
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,088
Also here's the story that Alex is spinning about the shooter's father

683
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,696
The father is a mental health counselor treating people with post-traumatic stress disorder

684
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Veterans Administration

685
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
Refer to guy to his Clinic to help with his

686
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
BTSD

687
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
Which was the result of a man showing up at his door and shoot again

688
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,752
The father worked at the guy and it set up a GoFundMe page to help him with the immediate

689
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
Expenses that he was unable to cover on his own

690
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,664
This is what Alex is making sound suspicious and it is proof of a conspiracy

691
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,480
The fact that his father worked in the mental health field

692
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,296
I know you'd help one of his patients setting up

693
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
Crowdfunding so they wouldn't go bankrupt

694
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
As a consequence of a

695
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Inshot

696
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
Legitimately Alex executive

697
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
There's no two ways about this

698
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:14,400
Chimney be in favor of veterans receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder shouldn't be in favor of therapists helping them set up Crow

699
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
Crowdfunding for their bills

700
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Delta so goddamn

701
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
To the state paying for that s***

702
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,800
641 second about why he would take

703
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,616
These bro

704
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
And just put a little tone on him and make him seem

705
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Suspicious and proof of a

706
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,992
This instant

707
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,832
I think you're pretty easily figure out why he's operating this way

708
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
I don't know

709
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Paramount

710
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Cuc

711
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,592
Is it a narrative that Alex has to cover up that he was a Democrat

712
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Super easily additive

713
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Page by anybody

714
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Republic we can do it

715
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
Before shooting

716
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,512
It was a propaganda it was back and forth between people

717
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:17,120
Editing his page

718
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Propaganda

719
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
To make his spurious

720
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
So that's where we're at

721
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Spell Alex

722
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Explicitly

723
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
About that my life

724
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
Chrysalises

725
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,976
Democrat

726
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
Sears

727
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
I'm busy lying

728
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
What are they

729
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
Here's a shot

730
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
No known said you made him

731
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:17,536
Don't know where Alex is getting the this page was up for years thing from

732
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Is that point home

733
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
He said that twice

734
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
And those weird long pauses

735
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
Definitely

736
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,032
I was thinking it would be a weird thing for him to make up

737
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,128
But if you did that it's important for him to attach

738
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
The story

739
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,736
The Story of My Life page appear stupid broken by Jim hoft

740
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
The Gateway pundit

741
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:43,136
It has a pretty full encapsulation with a narrative

742
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,952
Namely that asserts that without any proof that leftist

743
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
We're the ones were edited

744
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,280
Profile to hide that he was a registered Democrat

745
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
The article in its current form has a correction

746
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
At the bottom of the page

747
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,936
Saints

748
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Was created after the shooting

749
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,288
But it's not correcting any explicit claims that I can find

750
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Previous versions of the article

751
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Like the previous versions didn't delay age

752
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
I bet it had been up for years the way Alex

753
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,296
I would really can't find claim in any of the places where Alex is known to gather is

754
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,392
Obviously I can't possibly know what kind of stick and cheese

755
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,696
Impulses drive Alex to behave the way he does

756
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
But I had to guess

757
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
He's fully aware that this

758
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
What is reporting this

759
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
That the page was made after the shoot

760
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,472
And that whenever whatever did it put the

761
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
It was made to make it look like the shooter was Democrat and

762
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,384
Alex needs the perception to be that this page has been up for years

763
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
Because the fact that it happened

764
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Completely destroys is cause for suspicion

765
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
It also underlines how easy

766
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
For anyone to edit my flight page

767
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Is Alex's listeners understood this

768
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
Specifics of the situation

769
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
Do know that there isn't anything

770
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
Suspicious about this

771
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,584
It's just trolls on the internet going back and forth the shooter has 02

772
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,424
Narratives are to work at all the audience

773
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
To not understand this

774
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
Specifics of the situation

775
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
It's in his best interest

776
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
That they believe misinformation

777
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
So that's what he offers.

778
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
The feel of him

779
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Grasping

780
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Some kind of

781
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:17,344
Something and then hitting on the like it's been up for years almost in the mower

782
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,440
Sprite and then I wonder if I'm being like

783
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
I know that

784
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:28,352
Or I wonder if it's someone in his ear being like Alex

785
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,192
Yeah but not true

786
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Facts in your lion

787
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
You're either indicating that you don't know what you're talkin about of your life

788
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,176
One of the two

789
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Alex you made him

790
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Mistake on that

791
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,576
Is there a way with The Apprentice be like Alex quit

792
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
Yeah

793
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
Yeah

794
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Realize like

795
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Alex

796
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:02,912
You're drifting into behaviors that have got you seen before

797
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,216
I've been up for a long time like 4 years

798
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,776
Quit like direct opposition to reality

799
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:12,896
But that sort of behavior if applied to other areas of this story

800
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
Could get you screwed

801
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,736
I think it's raining

802
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
I think there might be

803
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,088
Giving him that call

804
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
Because he's not

805
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
I'll tell you who isn't

806
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
Barnes Barnes

807
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,304
Keep on going far I got a job

808
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,632
Stay the f*** off are in this aftermath of a tragedy

809
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
I think he knows the

810
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,848
Actually happened

811
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Fair

812
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
The people he gets

813
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Oh boy

814
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,856
So talks about

815
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
This

816
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
How he talked to reporters

817
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
That he works with

818
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
Headed for work

819
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
Unfair calling reporters

820
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,864
He's employed yes you've spoken to his underlings

821
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,656
About the coverage

822
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,496
They were going to put out about this story and I think he says a little bit

823
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Too much

824
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
In this next

825
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
About their intentions

826
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
F******

827
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
Fumbles the ball really hard while trying to remember

828
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,832
What's going on

829
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,512
Show I don't know who this guy is

830
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
Yesterday afternoon

831
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
Emily says to me

832
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,472
Well I'm going to look and see if his parents are psychologists cuz you know they're usually a psychologist

833
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Applications

834
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
The shooter

835
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
I'm am coming up

836
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Remember that

837
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Colorado

838
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,344
Psychologist

839
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,536
Here's psychiatrist was the former head psychiatrist in the Air Force

840
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
Over a DARPA program

841
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,520
I remember that one and yes you can

842
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,872
First things first at the end of his narrative about the Aurora shooting

843
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,432
Recover the back of a 2013 investigation

844
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,504
But the narratives about the DARPA program in the Air Force psychologist

845
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
Are completely different lies

846
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
It's supposed to be the James Holmes isn't DARPA program and got a bunch of money from DARPA and also that his psychologist

847
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Doctor Fenton

848
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
Was an Air Force mind control doctor

849
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
Because Alex knows that all the shity talks about is baseball

850
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Proposed

851
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,168
Care about being accurate but I never

852
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,264
He cares so little

853
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
Also I don't remember mind control chips

854
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,967
Being part of the conspiracy back then so I guess it's a later development

855
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,575
Well-researched

856
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
Now he's adding to Manchurian Candidate

857
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:09,535
I think I was always kind of a flavor of it even about the lie about

858
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
About the jailhouse.

859
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
Like that

860
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
From a book

861
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,423
Have a guy who was trying to

862
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,727
To get like he wrote the book because

863
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,263
State's Attorney didn't

864
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
Flexshopper

865
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
Shorter sentence

866
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
It's all bulshit

867
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,087
That's not even part of the conspiracy backpack

868
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
Why are you doing this

869
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:41,535
Anything you want

870
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,935
Such a lack of professionalism even within the area of lion

871
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:54,335
Robin the world it's crazy

872
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,871
And listen to him

873
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
Don't notice

874
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
And be like

875
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Hold on

876
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,575
You are sloppy we're going to go down on December 15th

877
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,135
2003 and then one of the date comes

878
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
The cult stays in his life

879
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,487
I misread

880
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,655
F*** what it is they're there for the excited to learn

881
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,727
I didn't know

882
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
Dangerous yet

883
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
I think the most important thing here is that why he's talking about

884
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,943
Textbook case of confirmation bias

885
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:37,599
Like before setting out to do any of the research Billy Weaver is told Alex that she feels like a lot of mass Shooters parents are psycho

886
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
She's entering the research with a

887
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,439
Conclusion already decided

888
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,767
She's not setting out to find out if Mass Shooters has icollege

889
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Parents more often than would be expected

890
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:53,215
To setting out to find a few examples that fit her decided talking point then she's going to make a propaganda video

891
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
It means anything

892
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,847
I would do the milly don't even care to engage with that s*** now not even a little bit

893
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
Apparently just honest way to make an argument that

894
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,735
Whatever the ensuing product is its meaning what

895
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,063
And ultimately whatever bottle like a bank would be equally

896
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,647
I can point out to you tonight at Shooters whose parents work psychology

897
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,303
Greater Point other than Alex

898
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,095
Intentionally

899
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
As opposed to being the product of thorough and methodical analysis

900
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
I feel like

901
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
Climate change isn't happy

902
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Scientist

903
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Here is a giant bag of money

904
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
Prove to me that climate change

905
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
And isn't happen

906
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:39,295
The only reason that somebody would operate this way the way that Alex is clearly describing Billy is operating is because

907
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
Because they're trying to create a

908
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,391
Absolutely anything to talk about.

909
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,695
Anything to not talk about radicalization

910
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,559
All of these conversations are

911
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,631
Too threatening to the underpinnings of the world that they profit off of

912
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,679
So to defend that toxic hellscape

913
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,751
He has pitched the theory that all these shooters of the children therapist

914
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,823
Set out to find a few examples to make a video about

915
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Sympathetic

916
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Transparent Behavior

917
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Lame

918
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,967
Yeah

919
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
You know

920
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
These people are such Psychopaths

921
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
I always wonder if

922
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,463
Mitch McConnell like Alex Jones goes home and looks at Rex

923
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,559
Singers helping to make sure that you might die in a match

924
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,679
I'm helping to make sure that the next Max mass shooting raise the risk

925
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
Yeah

926
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,543
Another mass shooting is going to

927
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
That's my job

928
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,895
Today today is the day that I say

929
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
At least

930
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
I don't know man

931
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
It's a

932
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,391
They just don't feel like it

933
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,951
Like what if you're like what if

934
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,511
You're just full of s*** about all this

935
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,047
What are you bringing about

936
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
What another rescue

937
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
What

938
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
Alex discusses the

939
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
V3 shooter

940
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
From the past week

941
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
He said something

942
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
About something

943
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
And then realized

944
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
Make time for this

945
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
This is

946
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
If there's a moment of levity

947
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
In this

948
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Alex's response

949
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,831
To realizing what road he's almost about to go to

950
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
What

951
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
The hell's going on people

952
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:38,335
That long pause I think

953
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:49,343
Oh no no no no

954
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,903
I know it's not funny to laugh about

955
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
These people Alex's

956
00:46:53,951 --> 00:47:00,095
Like his whole thing is so built on the ten-tails you realize he accidentally

957
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:06,495
Hold on the truth if I can if I continue to follow this thought I am going to be like

958
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:12,895
Young white man

959
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
Milly who

960
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
It's kind of like

961
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
You know

962
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
Further defend

963
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,983
What he's doing

964
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,263
His behavior

965
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,311
So your Appeals

966
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
I'm too

967
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
The past

968
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Happened

969
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
It's worth of the left

970
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
To kill people

971
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:04,095
Normal question everything

972
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
MacArthur left cover this next time

973
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,751
Turn on all this supposed shooter social media

974
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
He was a Democrat

975
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Call Jones

976
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
Paul Joseph Watson

977
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,087
So I mean that's all

978
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
My lifestyle

979
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,207
Lee demonstrates Alex Jones

980
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
It's pretty complex imma take this be

981
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
Piece by piece

982
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,071
The first element is the

983
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,167
Completely deceptive argument that he's just questioning

984
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,191
That's bulshit

985
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
He's building a case

986
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
That these shootings

987
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,287
False flag

988
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:50,175
Because the shoot is weak and he doesn't want to get sued he hides behind us why is it wrong to question things for a s***

989
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
Whenever all of his reporting

990
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,503
Guiding listeners to be clearly plant

991
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Conclusion

992
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
But this is a false flag

993
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
And that is the work of a true coward

994
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,415
The second element is the basic argument

995
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,951
You justify the active Quest

996
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
Which again is not what he's doing

997
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
He is

998
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Misinforming

999
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:11,935
He argues that because something in the past was deceptive it stands to reason that all future things could be

1000
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,751
And honestly I don't have a problem with that argument it's

1001
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
A basic position

1002
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Skepticism

1003
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
It's probably healthy

1004
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,919
The problem comes when he realizes Alex is not just questioning thing

1005
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
He's building misinformation there

1006
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
If you were questioning things

1007
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
If you would approach the situation

1008
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Position of caution

1009
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
And a hesitant

1010
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
Instareport anything definitive

1011
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Instead what do we see

1012
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:36,511
We see Alex creating a talking point that all these Mass Shooters of the kids of psychology

1013
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,559
Just you're probably secretly working for DARPA

1014
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
A misleading is audience

1015
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
It's about the edits that were made to a MyLife page

1016
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
The shooter had nothing to do with

1017
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
This is not question

1018
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,007
This is misinformation propaganda

1019
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,103
Maytag I just listeners away from the aspect of the story that are threatening to his business

1020
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
His worldview and is revenue stream

1021
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
Now he's only able to justify is argue

1022
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Manipulation

1023
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,063
And that is on Full display here

1024
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,879
Complete meaninglessness of term

1025
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:08,511
The examples he comes up with the babies in incubators thing and weapons of mass destruction

1026
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,303
Who is responsible for those lies

1027
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
The first was an excuse to get into the first Gulf War

1028
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,423
And the second was a pretext for the war in Iraq

1029
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,983
The first was George h.w. Bush Administration

1030
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
The second was W bush

1031
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,823
His administration

1032
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:27,199
What was those two Republican Administration says

1033
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
Yeah this is incredibly

1034
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
Manipulative framing

1035
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
To call the bush administration's the left

1036
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,415
Is the give up on even the slimmest pretense that you're talkin about anything real

1037
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,999
The wife is just another name for the globalist to the Deep state

1038
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:46,143
For Alex now so whatever anybody

1039
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
This is her children thing

1040
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,775
And it's really stupid to your forty-five-year-old man carrying on like this

1041
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
It's embarrassing

1042
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
But here's the thing

1043
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,407
There's no known embarrassing way for Alex

1044
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,479
How to make the argument that he's trying to make

1045
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
He has to do things like this

1046
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,391
Move around quick enough and pray that people don't take the time to recognize what he's doing

1047
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
These are tricks

1048
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
He's using tricks

1049
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,231
Letter very very

1050
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Clear

1051
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,327
Yeah yeah they're very distracting

1052
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,399
Cuz you almost didn't even catch that the last

1053
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,703
Fart

1054
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,751
Whatever it is

1055
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,567
Like if he says the left unlike it doesn't

1056
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,639
If he says globalist it doesn't f***

1057
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
Matter it's

1058
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,223
Feels like today is part of

1059
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
Let's

1060
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:41,439
Special Report is about how he predicted the

1061
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
El Paso shooting

1062
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,815
As we speak

1063
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:54,239
We very much said

1064
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Fine

1065
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,311
A mass shooting being a

1066
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,151
Well certainly

1067
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,687
As I understand it

1068
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:07,295
The clips I had heard

1069
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
But

1070
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
I cannot explain that in

1071
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
Entirely

1072
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
And I will over the course of the

1073
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,743
The show so I don't believe that he gets credit for being

1074
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,583
But here is a bit of that

1075
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:27,007
2 days after Alex Jones predicts that false flags are going to be carried out and blamed on the Q

1076
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,311
Movement and American Patriots

1077
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:34,943
Lone gunman Patrick crusius is arrested for the El Paso Massacre

1078
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
His social media page my life with change to

1079
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,903
And his designation as a registered Democrat

1080
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,207
Was changed to Republican

1081
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,047
So you can see that this my life thing is just an essential yeah yeah

1082
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,863
Everywhere throughout the

1083
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,887
Both of these episode

1084
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Yeah

1085
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:58,751
The Bedrock of why are we questioning thing

1086
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,799
We're misleading you about this

1087
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
Right

1088
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,151
I do not understand

1089
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
And why you were

1090
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711
Yes you are a f******

1091
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Before this mass shooting

1092
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,111
Send Alex Jones predict

1093
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:22,047
So you didn't do that some s*** was going to happen

1094
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,591
Stupid as a carrot

1095
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:39,967
Well the reality is it Alex literally everyday

1096
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,271
That big a deal for him to have

1097
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:48,671
There was a propaganda narrative it was going around that involved antifa and El Paso

1098
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,487
Why Alex said El Paso

1099
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
False flag

1100
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
So

1101
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,423
It's just his normal there's going to be a false flag

1102
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,263
He was in the middle of working on this other propaganda narrative

1103
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
So it's it's a confluent

1104
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
It creates the appearance that Alex is on

1105
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
Realities

1106
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
Don't boast

1107
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,551
Normal thing

1108
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,111
For it to expect from his show

1109
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
Is there a

1110
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
Has very strong for

1111
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
Predictive ability

1112
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,303
There's a

1113
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,095
Globalist

1114
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,423
Creative qanon I don't know if you know that

1115
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,287
This I was going to say

1116
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Qanon

1117
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,079
For a while

1118
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:44,479
Last I remember hearing he was anti

1119
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:48,575
There was some good information out of it

1120
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:54,463
I don't give a clique contracts or whatever

1121
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,767
Gotcha

1122
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Who's on 8chan

1123
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
Bye-bye

1124
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
Like I don't know what the status is

1125
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
It's gone

1126
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,495
Anyway Alex globalist

1127
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,031
Created qanon

1128
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
There's a real

1129
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
Nope

1130
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
This is

1131
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
A great

1132
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,319
Skyward like grading Alex's

1133
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
Conspiracies

1134
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
I'd be like

1135
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:26,975
You sat down and thought about this for a minute at least

1136
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,767
It's not good so stupid

1137
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,631
At least like

1138
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
You at least have a closet

1139
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Zanaflex here

1140
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,495
I'm just thinking about me

1141
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,055
Terror attacks

1142
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:55,647
But they can cut out of blame

1143
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
We've never taken

1144
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,055
Do Outreach out president

1145
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
Crime Boss

1146
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,967
Show me brother with a short or whatever

1147
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,863
That's a good conspiracy it's really what he should have been saying all along

1148
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,959
Cuz the complete mystery

1149
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,871
Is there something you can paint whatever you want

1150
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,151
Before because

1151
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:54,527
He was afraid of losing too much of his his audience were in 2 Q

1152
00:56:54,783 --> 00:57:00,927
Jerome corsi

1153
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,423
Cuz if it ate a cheese the goal that you wanted to achieve

1154
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,983
It creates a justification

1155
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,031
10 for all right-wing violence

1156
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,567
Right more or less

1157
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,127
You can just attributed to that

1158
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
Also the left

1159
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
But they're doing it

1160
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:33,695
Because of the mysterious Anonymous nature of it

1161
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
I mean it's really

1162
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:40,351
It's the greatest gift Alex could have ever had he's not I don't know why you haven't used it

1163
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,887
I will give you

1164
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
One theory on why he hasn't

1165
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
Because

1166
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,031
He just said that they they

1167
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,567
Convince them that they are

1168
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
Convert them into believing they're working

1169
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
King with the Press

1170
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Osher

1171
00:57:53,919 --> 00:58:00,063
It's very easy to

1172
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,135
Believe that you're working with the president while committing terrorism

1173
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:09,535
About committing terrorist acts against

1174
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
It's Alex's conception

1175
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,607
Trick yourself into thinking that you were doing

1176
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:18,751
Are we working with which alone is a bad

1177
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
Yeah

1178
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,567
I would

1179
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,847
Say

1180
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
Also they didn't

1181
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
Like he doesn't want to attack people to imagine that their work

1182
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
For the president cuz it'll

1183
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
Association

1184
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
Forgot

1185
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:42,047
Alex's Constant Contact the White House

1186
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
I'm so

1187
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
I can say that with some

1188
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Some confidence

1189
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
Fight you should know

1190
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
That he's alright

1191
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
Goodyear

1192
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
Providence

1193
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Studies

1194
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,063
No that can't be

1195
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:09,695
Shelbyville weather

1196
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:16,095
Come out

1197
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,519
Ignore all

1198
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
Twice

1199
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,383
Is exploding promoting

1200
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,623
And then I saw all the FBI reports coming out

1201
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
It's coming out

1202
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:54,495
And then I saw the FBI come out in

1203
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,359
Jones

1204
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,223
Is there going to

1205
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
El Paso

1206
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,599
Pretext

1207
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Today's weather

1208
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
No I didn't see that

1209
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
You literally can

1210
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
Can't see things like that

1211
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:26,751
What are you just at my last clip on this show where you're trying to hide behind I'm just questioning things

1212
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:30,335
Defense

1213
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,407
Conspiracy in order to maintain his absurd and dangerous world

1214
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,711
Just not the same thing as being skeptical

1215
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,271
Just imagine all the things that Alex needs to

1216
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
Substantiate to make that clip meaning

1217
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,367
He needs to provide real crimes

1218
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,439
Statistics he feels the FBI is covering up he needs to Val

1219
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,999
Date his contention that the crime statistics are fake

1220
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:52,351
He needs to substantiate hello earned media coverage of Epstein matters at all

1221
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,887
In terms of his prosecution

1222
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
He needs

1223
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:58,239
Promoting minority crime against

1224
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
He needs a dummy

1225
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,055
Answer to FBI director Ray of the deep

1226
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:07,455
Glen's run most of the FBI what most of the FBI mean

1227
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,271
He needs to show a citation for where the FBI

1228
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:15,903
The qanon was going to launch Terror attacks with Alex Joe he needs to show

1229
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,695
He needs to show literally

1230
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Email Paso shooting

1231
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,047
Tifa coming to El Paso

1232
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:28,447
And he can do all of those things in one second

1233
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:33,823
Store hours now

1234
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,175
Until he demonstrates our prove any of this

1235
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
None of that means

1236
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:47,391
Throws out in order to build his notion that the El Paso shooting was done to create a justification

1237
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,207
This is shity work

1238
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,255
And I need to be clear about two things

1239
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
1

1240
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,327
I don't need to rub but any of it

1241
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,959
It's all ahead of a paranoid man who knows his game is running out of gas

1242
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,031
I don't give a s*** about tried to demonstrate why this theory is stupid

1243
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
Text Notes app

1244
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,103
To this is not questioning

1245
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:13,247
This is the narrative that Alex has built his own imagination and things probably signed up for

1246
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,831
Would you now passing off as the official unofficial story what happened

1247
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,671
I know this is probably getting repetitive but it needs to be said over and over again

1248
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,719
Alex is not questioning things

1249
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
Creating and disseminating talk

1250
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,303
3.4 misinformation

1251
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,863
Which is all he does

1252
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,423
He's creating Facebook

1253
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,311
He's creating somebody post something ironically he's not on

1254
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:41,151
Exactly but somebody post something like we got to stop gun violence

1255
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,223
Here is this daddy and out somebody goes

1256
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Pointless

1257
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Stupid

1258
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:53,183
I'm doing is trying to give a little bit of

1259
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
Exactly

1260
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,743
That's all it is

1261
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,559
So what are the things that Alex

1262
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:04,959
It was already is that the idea that no Paso a Paso

1263
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,239
Facility

1264
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
Try to start a civil war

1265
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:13,663
I really don't remember the official spokesperson for antifa bring that out on the counter

1266
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,903
Especially when it comes to railing about ants

1267
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:30,303
FIFA space on some random post on a message board.

1268
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
As addicts unpleasant user interface

1269
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
I don't want to take through and try to find

1270
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
The f*** you talking about

1271
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,519
Alright let's

1272
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,567
See what he's talking about did Aunt Eva

1273
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
Client advisor

1274
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:55,391
Completely neutral and very legitimate journalist who else you will be

1275
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,511
On July 29th Andy posted a couple pictures of Flyers but a Viagra called border resistor

1276
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,559
Advertising their upcoming tour

1277
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:08,191
Including stops in Santa Cruz Oakland Minneapolis Chicago and then their last stop in El Paso on September 4th

1278
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:14,591
Eddie posted these flyers with the commentary antifa is leading a border resistance militancy training

1279
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,383
To where they will Converge on a 10 days

1280
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,663
El Paso

1281
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,991
The promotional image shows border Enforcement Officers being killed

1282
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,527
The government property Fireball

1283
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
From there

1284
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
The Narrative got rolling

1285
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,903
Be able to start it to me or Randy's framing of the event

1286
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,303
Fox News used 83 to the store so they could write a story about how it was going to start a terror campaign in El Paso

1287
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,351
And now the narrative is on its way to Alex

1288
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,823
According to them this wasn't buildings in El Paso

1289
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,895
Unfortunately all of that is right-wing propaganda bulshit

1290
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,967
The website for Border resistance clearly list the groups

1291
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
Involved and none of them are known to be associated with ants

1292
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,087
55 which is a stupid framing of the point since antifa isn't it

1293
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Centralized group

1294
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
For what

1295
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,159
What are the main groups

1296
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,719
Vault of Hecate Society quotes

1297
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,999
We are not offering billets

1298
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:09,375
We're having educational workshops about what's happening on the border and how to work better inside a community

1299
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,167
It's not militancy training

1300
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
Anyway

1301
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,983
Which was Andy's Frame

1302
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
Well

1303
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,311
Not reality

1304
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,151
Pre-empting or at least

1305
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,967
Co-opting maybe just full-on project

1306
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
That that's what they're doing

1307
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,575
Next flight

1308
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Militant

1309
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Operation

1310
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,903
Attributed

1311
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,695
To the left a military operation

1312
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:36,255
Mission in order to justify them creating a military

1313
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:42,911
Which is what Alex is doing

1314
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
Cause and effect

1315
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:50,847
Images of protesters shooting arrows at a nice

1316
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,615
Cancel

1317
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:55,967
Any kind of intention of violence

1318
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,295
They were going to change it to avoid any further misunderstanding

1319
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,343
Which I would find out is an intentional

1320
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
F*** that f*** you

1321
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:10,815
The reality the reality of the situation is an immigrant

1322
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,631
Group is playing at or where they would have workshops about how to best

1323
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,167
Respond to worsening situation

1324
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
In their communities

1325
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
Sit around their command

1326
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
And they chose a possibly ill-advised picture

1327
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
Your brother flyer

1328
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,823
From their imaginative

1329
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,151
Imaginative s*** heads like Andino ran with it grated

1330
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,711
Narrative Plantera campaign

1331
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
Decided to call this group antifa because it fit their pre-existing

1332
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,087
This story was a lie

1333
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
But it didn't until after the shooting in El Paso

1334
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,463
A which point it could be incorporated into a larger

1335
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Conspiracy

1336
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
It's fascinating really

1337
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,791
It started out of

1338
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Just waited to be rattled

1339
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:49,215
Construct the organizing capabilities of non-white peoples trying to protest conditions at the border and ultimately through the

1340
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,335
He turned it to a narrative that Alex is using to argue that the El Paso

1341
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:00,735
That's just Synergy Dan that's in their world a happy accident

1342
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
That's

1343
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:10,207
Book oh the Places You'll Go to mine

1344
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,255
You don't know where you're going to go

1345
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,863
See how it works

1346
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,959
So it is next clip Alex

1347
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
Does something

1348
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,287
This is another really

1349
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
Essential

1350
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,079
Framing

1351
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,871
For him whenever he's trying to

1352
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
The Craft

1353
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,407
The presentation

1354
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
Ocean of the

1355
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,223
Horrible event

1356
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
As false flag

1357
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,807
There's something to eat

1358
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
This is

1359
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,647
I don't know how to set this up but this is

1360
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Important

1361
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:47,327
Obvious

1362
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
Eminem

1363
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,007
So what do you talk about with the prehype there is that FBI came out that was talked about

1364
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
Conspiracy theory related

1365
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:05,503
Stupid guy but this is one of those moments where you see how he's been pretty smart and classic world

1366
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,063
Consequences

1367
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,367
Cabiri contextualized as proof

1368
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
Of the very

1369
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
Conspiracies he talks

1370
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,975
Alex's absolutely stochastic

1371
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:19,583
Terrorist has particular groups and individuals who disagrees with in such a way

1372
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,703
He absolutely has to have reasonable expectation that someone might be inspired to hurt

1373
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
I don't

1374
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
Believe in adult

1375
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
Could not under

1376
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
Understand the connection

1377
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,567
Between rhetoric

1378
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Impossible inspiration

1379
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,455
Between this strategy in the leaderless resistance organization of the right-wing

1380
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,479
Extremist cells

1381
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,783
It's very easy to inspire lone-wolf terrorist

1382
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,367
Sactional while keeping any real concrete connections to a minimum

1383
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,695
It strains my credulity to imagine Alex has been aware of this

1384
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,231
This phenomenon for a long time

1385
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:52,607
Because of the lies you told about his trip to the Bohemian Grove The Inspired Amanda show up they're heavily armed

1386
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:55,679
Intending to kill Grove attendees who Alex

1387
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,263
Were there worshiping the devil and possibly even sacrificing children

1388
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Hamalach

1389
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,591
Thirty-seven-year-old Richard McCaslin

1390
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,895
Call himself Patriots

1391
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,711
Enter the Grove explicitly hoping for a shootout

1392
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
He told the San Francisco Chronicle quote

1393
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,807
I was expecting armed resistance

1394
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,111
And I would have fired back if I was fired upon

1395
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,927
When sheriff's deputies found if you was armed with quotes

1396
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:23,327
A double-barrel shotgun assault rifle hybrid a two-foot-long scored a 45 caliber pistol a crossbow and

1397
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
And a handmade bomb launcher

1398
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,423
Handmade bomb launcher

1399
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,471
That's just like too much

1400
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:36,383
I would also guess what launcher B

1401
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,271
Tested I imagine

1402
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,855
He would not have been successful

1403
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:47,903
Yeah

1404
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:52,511
In court McCaslin testified that he was inspired to do this room watching Alex's documentary Dark Secret

1405
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,047
About Bohemian Grove

1406
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:57,631
So he quotes you're collecting weapons and staking out the Grove

1407
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:58,911
He said quote

1408
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,447
I was asking our reports

1409
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
Human sacrifice

1410
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,823
Those weren't reports he was acting

1411
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Intend

1412
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
Did goal

1413
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,455
The story is honestly if

1414
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
Prosthetic tail

1415
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,503
From this article

1416
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,783
Cisco Chronicles

1417
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:20,415
McCaslin was wearing a bulletproof vest blue fatigues with Phantom Patriots spelled out in Red Letters across the chest

1418
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,951
And a rubber skeleton mask

1419
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,231
Crept into the Grove

1420
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,767
F*** you cosplaying

1421
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:32,191
He quickly found himself hopelessly lost

1422
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,239
F****** good feeling almost

1423
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:38,335
Silly caught and went to sleep

1424
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:42,431
The next morning mccasland said he discovered the club

1425
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,735
And would have blown it up if he had explosives

1426
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,063
Instead he placed an Old Testament verse from Leviticus at the base of

1427
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
The statue

1428
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:54,207
Alone with no enemy or anybody else

1429
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,743
But sprinklers quickly

1430
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Extinguish the flame

1431
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
What a loser

1432
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
You're pathetic

1433
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:07,007
It's kind of funny the mental image of him going

1434
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,031
Go Saturday to play

1435
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,847
Go to bed

1436
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,871
Paul Blart

1437
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
It's a

1438
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,223
It's goof it's goofy but I mean

1439
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,807
It it's Goofy with a murder intent behind it

1440
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,111
Really scared

1441
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,951
McCaslin did all that in 2002

1442
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:31,327
Alex had to of known as early as then that's what he was doing was playing with fire and he does

1443
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
Care

1444
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:37,983
He knows the consequences of his actions who knows what could happen any knows what he's doing to people it just doesn't matter to him

1445
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,567
Alex knows he's not the only person who has this effect on their audience

1446
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:46,687
He doesn't plenty of right-wing terrorist cells exist in this country because he often interviewed people from them

1447
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:50,271
He has dirt roads on from old keepers of town over the years

1448
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
Is that Gavin McGinnis

1449
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,087
The proud Boys on a ton

1450
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,391
Even pathetically trying to debate David Duke on his

1451
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,951
Michelle ecosystem exist

1452
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
That he's a part of it

1453
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
Are there people who are much more dangerous

1454
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,119
He knows that this country has a right-wing violence broke

1455
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,143
Problem

1456
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,679
And he's out of his whole career

1457
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:13,311
He knows that say the right law-enforcement bodies started taking their problem seriously he's completely sucked

1458
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,639
Even forgetting about possible legal consequences of his actions

1459
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,943
The good, I don't know how that would work but

1460
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,991
You got to be kind of worried

1461
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
Hey it's a hypothetical thing

1462
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,183
Started having the right conversation but the nature of this form of inspiring terrorists

1463
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,743
He knows that is but business model doesn't work anymore

1464
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:35,327
So he preemptively attacks any attempt by law

1465
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,375
Even look at the problem rational

1466
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,679
We saw this with the miac report back in

1467
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,727
2009 and received your again

1468
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,055
Has the FBI has released a report discussing the connection between

1469
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,103
Conspiracy theory in the growing terrorist threat in the

1470
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:47,871
This country

1471
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
He has to attack these things

1472
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,455
And pray they go away

1473
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
Because it is only shot at self-preservation

1474
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,831
Yeah it's exactly like the gun lobby

1475
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
He's getting a

1476
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Bill passed

1477
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
Legal to it

1478
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,695
Invest

1479
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Gunn vile

1480
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,743
Enola

1481
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,303
Huge win

1482
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,375
But the huge win for them and a huge loss for the

1483
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,655
Continue to exist

1484
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:18,591
He can easily just say that they're trying to make us look bad

1485
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,151
Frames that he is gorgeous

1486
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,223
I put out this report abeka

1487
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,831
Conspiracy theorist in terrorism shooting a little while later

1488
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,367
Well one might look

1489
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,975
Validates the warning of the FBI report

1490
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
This is the problem

1491
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,607
Seriously long ago Alex Goes the other direction

1492
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,143
The FBI report was

1493
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
Preheat for the shooting

1494
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,495
So when it happened it will be blamed on people like Alex

1495
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,543
This is self-protect

1496
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:54,175
This is the man who knows that the world that he's helped create the world of paranoid anti-government extremists

1497
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:58,527
Is one way more violence

1498
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
I'm coming weeks and months most likely

1499
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,927
The only way to continue to own the market space that he does as this world worth it

1500
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,255
Is to do everything possible to make sure that law enforcement doesn't take

1501
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
This issue series

1502
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,815
And the best way to do that

1503
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,167
Is the frame every attempt to take it seriously as a piece of the false flag shootings themselves

1504
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,215
Honestly this is pathetic

1505
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,263
A where I'm sitting all the signals is

1506
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,335
2009 Alex wasn't afraid of the miac

1507
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
Report

1508
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,895
He saw it as a ratings Bonanza

1509
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
It shows changed a lot

1510
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,455
Since then though

1511
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,759
And now report like this coming from the FBI

1512
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
It seems like

1513
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
And I think it's you

1514
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Cuz I take a shower

1515
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,951
Isaac I think that's

1516
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
Hi bug

1517
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:43,583
Maybe in 2009 you can make an argument that FBI making a report

1518
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,423
It's like the miac report doesn't really affect Alex

1519
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,703
He doesn't really

1520
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,263
Ya know what first of all is only the script

1521
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
Dipper part 14 script

1522
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:56,895
Anyway even if it were it wouldn't really involved and it was about actual malicious

1523
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,687
Is about actual extremist

1524
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
Spell

1525
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
So like

1526
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
That

1527
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,063
Is just

1528
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Red meat

1529
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
This ice field

1530
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
It seems very

1531
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,951
818

1532
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,487
Like he recognizes

1533
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
Is that

1534
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,791
Alright

1535
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,095
Is show exist

1536
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
In such a way that like

1537
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,911
He is now kind of what they're talkin

1538
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,703
Absolutely

1539
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
Goodnight my love I named it all

1540
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Bye

1541
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,055
Either way

1542
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
No I mean

1543
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,895
Being in the wake of a what was it

1544
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,431
Nebraska

1545
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,271
The representative who is like hey dudes we got a

1546
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,551
Stop with this whole leg

1547
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,575
Let's kill immigrants

1548
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Puppy party there

1549
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,671
Register as a Democrat you're out

1550
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
It's kind of like

1551
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,767
Wow you guys are all in on terror

1552
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:49,119
In others know if you're kicking people out for saying please stop inside

1553
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:49,887
Terrorism

1554
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,191
That kind of suggests that you're a terrorist

1555
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,263
Or at least use don't care

1556
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,543
Least you just don't care which is

1557
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,823
I don't know I

1558
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
In some ways worse

1559
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:04,223
Maybe you know

1560
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,807
Is a little bit afraid

1561
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Of this memo

1562
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,855
I think it's possible

1563
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,415
I sent his tone being a little bit

1564
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,999
But I also have a strong suspicion

1565
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,863
Conspiracy theorist

1566
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,335
Pedophile

1567
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,663
Actually says that

1568
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,943
So they're talking about you

1569
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,783
I'm positive

1570
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,575
The came out last week

1571
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:46,207
But he's using it as a basis for saying such as whole weekends of shootings was a globalist

1572
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,327
This report came out

1573
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,375
Cuz Alex saying

1574
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
The shooting

1575
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
Conspiracy

1576
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,495
What does elf

1577
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,287
Decide to release the report when it did

1578
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:03,615
It Was Written in May 2019

1579
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,175
The research covers extremist factions

1580
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,967
January 2008 to the present

1581
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,319
The document was released when it was because that's when Yahoo news obtained it and printed it

1582
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
To assert that the timing is a

1583
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:17,951
Conspiracy its acclaimed it prior to the globalist knew that these three dudes

1584
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,511
We're going to commit mass shootings

1585
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,071
To report to Yahoo

1586
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,119
It's a completely absurd thing to think

1587
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,911
What do you think it'll take a second.

1588
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
And think about what Alex's

1589
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:32,287
I mean unless you're also including that they were already planning

1590
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
And so of course

1591
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Right

1592
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,687
Still crazy

1593
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,479
Don't get me wrong

1594
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:46,879
Still crazy but that's the only way to Belmont

1595
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
First one hour

1596
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,255
I guess that makes sense

1597
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:57,119
The report came out and said there were shootings would require is insane

1598
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,007
Alex didn't read that report lying about what's in it

1599
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,311
Ain't no point to they say that anyone who believes in

1600
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,591
Conspiracy that is Adam s

1601
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
Doesn't mention

1602
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Clinton or Alex

1603
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,479
If you read the report I do think that Alex has every reason

1604
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Scared by it

1605
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:20,159
The FBI assesses in some cases and government political conspiracy theory

1606
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,951
We likely encourage the targeting was

1607
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,255
Specific people places and organizations

1608
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,839
Thereby increasing the risk of extremist violence against Dutch Target

1609
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,167
The FBI's mostly talkin about qanon but I think that's

1610
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,239
Pretty much sums up how I feel about Alex in the present day

1611
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,799
So I disagree with them

1612
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,871
So

1613
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:47,039
This report is a threat assessment has the threat posed by political

1614
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,879
Welcome to the party as bi

1615
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:56,255
It's probably too late to do anything about it I do not trust the FBI to follow through

1616
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
The positive sign

1617
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,095
I'll Reserve judgment on this until we see more about things

1618
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,655
Play out but for now I'm going to treat this as it is

1619
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,935
An internal memo

1620
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,215
It doesn't necessarily change

1621
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
Yeah the

1622
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,615
Who was it the guy was like we don't want

1623
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,151
Discouraged from

1624
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,687
Doing anything about white matter

1625
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
Terrorist

1626
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
Because we don't want Trump

1627
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,271
Feel like we're attack

1628
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,575
Like that's a simple

1629
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,623
Encapsulation of

1630
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
That's it

1631
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,695
Yep

1632
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,767
So the main narrative I would say that Alex

1633
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,559
The selling

1634
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,607
The FBI memo the

1635
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,935
Talk about Raiders weapons a mess

1636
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,703
Destruction

1637
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,983
Madeleine Albright

1638
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
Stop

1639
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,287
Defecation

1640
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,359
The main narrative is that the MyLife profile was true

1641
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,151
Yes that's the big thing

1642
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:50,527
Democrat to Republican to cover the tracks blah blah blah

1643
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,879
And then number two is that his dad worked in psychiatry

1644
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,159
In psychology

1645
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,951
Enough

1646
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,791
Narrative now the idea of shooters

1647
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,583
Having parents

1648
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,375
Who were in the psych building

1649
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
This is

1650
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
This isn't good

1651
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:13,311
Yesterday I was some of my reporters and literally were like Galaxy

1652
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
The family are working

1653
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
Anomaly

1654
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,392
Here's some of these articles

1655
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:32,512
Fishing shops I called you today Harvard's experiment on the Unabomber

1656
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
CIA mind-control

1657
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,864
He fails to provide

1658
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,192
Any other examples of a mass shooter

1659
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,216
Parents were

1660
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,752
Psychologist or psychiatrist

1661
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,800
Yeah but one of them was the Unabomber

1662
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:54,016
Universities are

1663
01:20:54,272 --> 01:21:00,416
Do you know it was a summer program

1664
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,744
MK Ultra

1665
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,792
So you got

1666
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
You got that

1667
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
Which is great

1668
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
Cuz he saying that there's

1669
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,448
Multiple examples doesn't have any examples penny

1670
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:17,056
Jumps over to distracting you look over here

1671
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,104
Unabomber

1672
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,968
I bet he's skipped from the Unabomber over to the Aurora shooter James Holmes

1673
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,576
He's already completely f***** up his conspiracies from

1674
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,368
2013

1675
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,160
Farther

1676
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,720
For it like he really is adding a

1677
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
Ton

1678
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:39,328
Tobacco emergency situation

1679
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,888
Throw everything in the kitchen six yeah

1680
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,936
You understand the Aurora

1681
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,704
Pewter

1682
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
Call jail mates

1683
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
I was drugged up

1684
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,056
I'm in electroshock

1685
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,360
I'm in a program

1686
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,944
And I blacked out and I don't know what happened but please get me out of here

1687
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
It turned out

1688
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
He's just add runs the DARPA

1689
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,112
Human brain interface

1690
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,648
Which computer program

1691
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,696
Electrodes in the brain

1692
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
What

1693
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
What is he talking about

1694
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:20,288
Google who is Daddy

1695
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:24,896
Weather Dimensions project

1696
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,712
That wasn't part of the narrative

1697
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:32,064
Depart conspiracy theories it all back in Alex's going over this day

1698
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,880
12 years ago timeline

1699
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
Workout

1700
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
Cuz that

1701
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
That was before

1702
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
That shooting took place in

1703
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
2012

1704
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,912
Gunman James Holmes with Robert Holmes

1705
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:51,008
He testified at his son's trial and of course the investigation lot information

1706
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
Became publicly available about him

1707
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
He was a retired financial analyst

1708
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:59,712
Working in the field of credit card

1709
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,736
He did not work for now

1710
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,064
Melding whatever the f*** Alex's rambling about

1711
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:10,464
His mother Arlie was a nurse so that's in the healthcare field

1712
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,000
Analyst to the Stars

1713
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,536
I don't think that's what I like

1714
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:19,424
There's a large Chasm between control and registered nurse

1715
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
Okay

1716
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,104
DARPA

1717
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,152
I think what's going on here is really simple Acts

1718
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:31,456
Might demonstrate how stupid Alex Jones

1719
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
How dumb he thinks is

1720
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,880
There's another guy named Robert Holmes who was an amateur astronomer

1721
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,440
In two

1722
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,976
Which is 12 years ago

1723
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:49,632
Google

1724
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:56,032
Yes that's the world we're living in

1725
01:23:56,288 --> 01:24:00,640
Grant to do it full-time job would you like to a lot of feel-good press

1726
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:07,040
Around 8 because there's this guy who just was passionate about astronomy

1727
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:10,368
We want you to be able to do it on your own

1728
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:16,768
But as a job

1729
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,168
Honestly this might be generous of me to assume that Alex is talking

1730
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:23,936
Think about this

1731
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,496
Like it legitimately might be

1732
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:33,152
Enough details are similar to same name as his dad

1733
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,040
There are no coincidences there too

1734
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
To give you pause

1735
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,368
Before dismissing it as a

1736
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,160
An outright

1737
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
But whatever the case

1738
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,768
It's not true of the Aurora shooter

1739
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
Just talkingshit

1740
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,352
Financial analyst

1741
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:57,216
So Alex and his next book we already heard him at the beginning of the episodes

1742
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,240
What's going on

1743
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,264
Repeat

1744
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,544
And then

1745
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,104
Get close to what might be

1746
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,640
What do you want to call it

1747
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,664
Flippant libel

1748
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:08,992
Okay

1749
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,040
I don't know what's going on

1750
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,648
The shooters dad

1751
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,696
What's PTSD

1752
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,048
Agreement was a bunch of psychiatrist with

1753
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
10 years of education

1754
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,424
Runnings Pentagon programs in Dallas

1755
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
Okay

1756
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,776
But why is it always that why why

1757
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,824
Why why is

1758
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,176
Always

1759
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,016
What

1760
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,624
Everything's fine

1761
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,928
Nothing to look at here

1762
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,256
I feel like what he's heavily implying it

1763
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,792
Some sort of alike you abused

1764
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
Tucson or mine

1765
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:55,840
In control

1766
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,424
Like I think I would

1767
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,288
Mcfucking is compared to Sandusky

1768
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,592
Why else would

1769
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,384
Because he's a good football coach

1770
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,200
Looks like what are you

1771
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
Evicted

1772
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:19,136
Close there's no other 100

1773
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:23,488
I'm saying I think Alex is real close

1774
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
That line

1775
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:30,912
Pier like if you continue down this path he's going to be behaving in the exact same way as he did towards the family members

1776
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,704
Victims of Sandy Hook

1777
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,240
And Scout

1778
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,336
I think someone around him better stop him

1779
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,152
Don't

1780
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,176
Play Toronto

1781
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:45,248
Ethika

1782
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,136
So the shooters dad had a master's degree which is all his line of work requires

1783
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,696
He apparently also practice some non-traditional medicine

1784
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,720
Sandwiches

1785
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,512
The calling I have a guru

1786
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,584
All this is complete bulshit the fuk down

1787
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,704
Pretending a veterinarian and chiropractor I pretended they were actual doctors about bought him a house

1788
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,264
So you can take that tone and shove it right up his ass

1789
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,080
Talk about your Computing the skies

1790
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,872
Mental health credentials

1791
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,176
Chiropractor

1792
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,248
Do they even have to have there's a special degree

1793
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,320
Yeah yeah that's

1794
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:24,160
It's more legitimate

1795
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,976
Also

1796
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:27,744
Whatever the socks

1797
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,304
Also I found the article that Alex's reading

1798
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,864
They're Inquisitor

1799
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,912
He just doesn't know how to read

1800
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,216
This is really a big problem

1801
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,520
He's saying that the father was overpass

1802
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,056
Pentagon programs in Dallas

1803
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,336
But the actual set

1804
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,920
He said he was reading was quote that was quote

1805
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:49,504
A facility director of dapa psychiatric program

1806
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
Dallas

1807
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,040
Joppa

1808
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:57,696
Alex Alex Alex

1809
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
That's too stupid

1810
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
That's too stupid

1811
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,584
I don't know I know it's true

1812
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,680
It is DARPA

1813
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,520
So stupid and alcohol program advisor

1814
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,312
Cuz he works in addiction medicine

1815
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,664
Alex is legitimately the most embarrassing person to study in the world

1816
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,504
You always want there to be something interesting at the root of his lies but sometimes

1817
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,040
She just doesn't know how to cold read

1818
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,576
This is embarrass

1819
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
Alec Lane

1820
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,648
If you are listening you are at

1821
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,416
Cowardly

1822
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
You f****** p

1823
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:33,536
So in this next Cliff Alex

1824
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,400
I haven't heard this guy on before but

1825
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,728
Do you have got the lamest voice

1826
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:46,848
I hate to pretty people for their their voices really control

1827
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,152
I would never could take him for his voice

1828
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
If it wasn't

1829
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,760
A completely fake voice

1830
01:28:54,016 --> 01:29:00,160
I just wanted to bring up one thing I have yet to find a shooter and obviously we're still learning about these two nutcases from the last

1831
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
24-hours

1832
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,720
The shooter

1833
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:09,120
Not on ssris or some form of brain chemicals

1834
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:20,640
A brain altering chemicals shrinking grade

1835
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,944
Are psychologists

1836
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,344
A big name relevant

1837
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,880
This day

1838
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,256
I'm guessing the block was too hot

1839
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,816
Count dankula was busy so I was got Tom pepper

1840
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,584
To come in

1841
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,800
It's just Dum laga retweets being spammed after was less than 400 followers

1842
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,592
I guess he's relevant here

1843
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:54,176
Because he created a Facebook page called God Emperor Trump

1844
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
Which teams help

1845
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992
I don't like that

1846
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,040
I would like him to be

1847
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:10,048
And it's just as seen on The Alex Jones Show LOL

1848
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,376
I'm not sure what the lol supposed to be in there but whatever

1849
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
Batman

1850
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,728
You guys got to figure out humor

1851
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,032
Yeah the rain LOL

1852
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:24,896
Copperhead

1853
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,944
Starting your own media outlets on YouTube

1854
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,272
I swear that vocal Cadence he's putting on his all over the place

1855
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:36,928
It's like these Dum Dums don't realize the people doing the impression that they are making fun of him

1856
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,464
Yeah I know

1857
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,536
Cool

1858
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:47,936
Stupid opens up his appearance on the show by

1859
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,216
Shooter was not on site

1860
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:54,848
You should probably shut the f****** because all you're really saying is that you've never looked into it

1861
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,640
It's so manipulative

1862
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:00,480
I don't know anything about this topic but you should probably accept my blanket assertion about it

1863
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,280
Is showing your own

1864
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,840
Stupidity and saying I don't know what I'm talkin

1865
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:20,704
Top as for one example so I guess I can start with 15 year olds

1866
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:30,432
Actually you can't start there I get to that right after he goes and straight up Fox

1867
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
Himself

1868
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:35,296
This level of irresponsible bullshittin misinformation particularly after a weekend

1869
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Such tragic

1870
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,600
Is furiously Danger

1871
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:41,184
No information to put it on

1872
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,512
It make it anyway

1873
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Yeah

1874
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:49,376
No I don't get one it's one thing to have a point

1875
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,400
I guess it would be

1876
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
Hard to make of this

1877
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,192
Point

1878
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:58,848
Yeah I don't know I can't defend it nevermind no I don't understand how we're not having the conversations at all

1879
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,384
All of these people are complicit in

1880
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,432
Well cuz no one's ever heard of

1881
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,992
I was

1882
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,320
He's not related to Tom Popeyes

1883
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:18,304
Dr. Peter langman who run School shooters that info

1884
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,072
High school shooting

1885
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,888
He studied involved shooters were not on any psychiatric

1886
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
At all nor have I ever been

1887
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,800
That number dropped to 71% when you looked at College Shooters and 59%

1888
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:38,016
Even if the number went down as the perpetrator got older the vast majority of cases did not involve Shooters who were on site

1889
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,904
The high-profile cases involve people who had Histories on beds but not all of them do

1890
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,184
For instance

1891
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,488
Columbine Eric Harris

1892
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:55,424
How does that factor into this overly simplified stupid narrative that they sell

1893
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:06,176
What is looking into this

1894
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,224
Insane thing we're like right wing

1895
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,992
Insight

1896
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:12,064
Antipsychotic meds were like

1897
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,856
Yeah Eric Harris is on site

1898
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,416
Like my records have never been released

1899
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:23,072
Because it doesn't match the information

1900
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:28,192
That's why I am not going to engage with an argument

1901
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,216
Here's the deal

1902
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,008
These people don't know what their talk

1903
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,104
Never heard of a shooter wasn't.

1904
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,408
Gwen most

1905
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,688
In his defense he is deaf

1906
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,576
He's only heard of them

1907
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:50,976
Because there's a huge talking point the right-wing conspiracy world most likely because it's an extension of the globalist

1908
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:57,376
They're trying to pass by everyone

1909
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:03,776
Through the lens wires like

1910
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,080
Alex you get the sense that

1911
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:10,176
If you look at reality you see that Alex is lying to

1912
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:13,248
To you and it's not hard to see why people like him are lying

1913
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:17,600
Also I'm still waiting for Alex to give me one more example of a shooter

1914
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,392
Parents are in the psychological community

1915
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,928
I'm sure there are some

1916
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:23,744
Fastly refused to give me even one

1917
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,512
Example

1918
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,816
Seitters at 2

1919
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
Not good thing

1920
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Sucks

1921
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
Little bit

1922
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,032
I don't know I was wondering like why is he on the show

1923
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,592
I mean I know that he doesn't God Emperor Trump account

1924
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,872
That makes sense

1925
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,920
Really shouldn't be that easy

1926
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,456
It's not that easy

1927
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:47,296
The rackaracka that's right on time and It's Tricky

1928
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,088
Need to get booked on Alex Jones Show

1929
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
Here's what

1930
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:50,880
To do

1931
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,792
Pro Trump

1932
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,840
Facebook

1933
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,376
Infowars.com

1934
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
Newswars.com

1935
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:06,240
He's also

1936
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:09,056
The manager was a great TV stations were on

1937
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,872
He's the manager

1938
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,552
Complete 01

1939
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,368
No.

1940
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:24,160
Prevailing consensus

1941
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,184
Is that

1942
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,464
This

1943
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,000
Shooter in El Paso

1944
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:33,376
Pretty roundly as his actual name

1945
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,728
I think the Assumption can easily be made

1946
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,544
That is inspired by a lot of the very similar

1947
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,312
Motivation

1948
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,336
That are

1949
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:47,712
People like soccer Carlson all over the right

1950
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,760
So

1951
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,576
You have that perception and that's what's being

1952
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
Disgust

1953
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:54,880
A lot of

1954
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,160
Lemoore

1955
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,696
Sensible areas

1956
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,976
Internet

1957
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,768
Birdman

1958
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,096
Wasn't

1959
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,376
He knows

1960
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:12,288
You look at his LinkedIn profile he doesn't have any second amendment stuff on there

1961
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:18,688
He doesn't have any Alex Jones quotes on there but somehow they managed

1962
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
Fascinating

1963
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
So

1964
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:27,648
In order in order for him to Define somebody as a right-winger they must have second amendment stuff or Alex

1965
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,416
Quotes

1966
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,696
On their linked

1967
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,232
F****** in page

1968
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:37,888
I didn't see either of those men's barely on his I just saw I was on the Alex Jones Show LOL

1969
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:43,008
Price this is a real stupid

1970
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,824
Play stuff like this dude like this is stupid s***

1971
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,664
These people are saying

1972
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,968
If you can't yell fire in a crowded

1973
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:59,648
What are we going to apply to Shooters

1974
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,672
And you're complicit

1975
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:04,256
Like there's no maybe the reporting side

1976
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,560
There's a First Amendment argument

1977
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,352
But the opinion side

1978
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,888
It's it's garbage

1979
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,424
We've got to start prosecuting

1980
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:17,568
And you're like

1981
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:22,176
At their two is kind of important

1982
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:27,808
And that is the way we already have qualifications about free speech that have to do with mitigating

1983
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,088
You can't do things

1984
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
That caused harm to people with your speech

1985
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,184
You can't threaten to kill people

1986
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:33,952
Well you can't

1987
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,976
Extort people

1988
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:38,048
Through your words you should be able to

1989
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:45,216
You yell fire in a crowded building whatever you caused a stampede you could be held responsible

1990
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,496
For your words

1991
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,520
Legally

1992
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,336
Yep so there is already a precedent that

1993
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,616
Some sorts of speech

1994
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,896
Do cause

1995
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,920
Kind of damage

1996
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,992
We do not believe it is protected

1997
01:37:57,248 --> 01:38:02,112
So I mean it's just a conversation and I don't

1998
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:09,536
These words hurt somebody therefore they're bad or there is illegal

1999
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,072
We all need to have

2000
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,888
I think they were going to

2001
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
Help

2002
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,192
This problem

2003
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,984
That is that is

2004
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,288
Priority conversation

2005
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:24,384
To have so we can get the absolutists

2006
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,664
I'll probably

2007
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:32,064
And I think that maybe unsurprisingly and maybe sometimes they're absolutism

2008
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,088
About free speech

2009
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,624
Really belies

2010
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,904
Other priorities

2011
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,928
But they're trying to

2012
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,952
Tired behind

2013
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:39,744
Bright

2014
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
I think that's

2015
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,048
The case with

2016
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,328
Absolute

2017
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,120
Absolutely

2018
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,704
Also really weird to me because

2019
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,496
I kind of expected

2020
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,544
Get in it'll be a lot of

2021
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,664
El Paso shooter a lot of stuff about the Dayton shooter

2022
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,688
Unexpected

2023
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
Tubi

2024
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,504
The largely focused on that

2025
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Alex

2026
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,808
Doesn't talk

2027
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,832
About a ton

2028
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,624
Like he does

2029
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,648
Absolutely

2030
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,672
The stuff is

2031
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,696
Related

2032
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
To those things

2033
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,768
But I think

2034
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,304
Most interesting things

2035
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,072
He says

2036
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,776
Okay

2037
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,568
F***** up

2038
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,848
Position yeah

2039
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,128
In this next clip

2040
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,408
We're going to listen to

2041
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,176
To hear

2042
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,480
I think he's advocating

2043
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,272
For retaining the death penalty

2044
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,344
But his reasoning for it is Ludacris

2045
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:43,744
It was was the former head of Air Force weapons development

2046
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:51,424
Communist

2047
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,240
Shameless

2048
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,160
You see how that works

2049
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,488
No I have no idea how that works

2050
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:18,048
Important to retain

2051
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:18,816
F******

2052
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,840
Capital punishment

2053
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,400
Because if we don't

2054
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:28,544
Then the Communist agitators will know that they can commit whatever crimes blamed the nationalists

2055
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,872
Found just go to prison and blah blah blah. Get out

2056
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,896
Wow

2057
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
Some of them

2058
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,832
Doesn't make

2059
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
God damn better

2060
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,440
F***** are you even

2061
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,208
Talking about

2062
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
Here's the position

2063
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,448
Told me that s*** Cheese's still

2064
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,752
Yeah I know I don't

2065
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,520
That's a good reason

2066
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
Penalty around

2067
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,848
I feel like there's so many problems

2068
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,128
Castration

2069
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,944
You might as well head in his

2070
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,760
And you might as well be like we need to keep the death penalty or route

2071
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,808
Because if we don't The Snorks

2072
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:14,624
Are going to come to real life and they're going to attack us all

2073
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,648
And take our shoes away

2074
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:20,768
You talked to Ben Capehart

2075
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,328
I think that all this is

2076
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:26,912
Is it this conversation that's starting up about how Trump

2077
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,192
Wants to bring back the

2078
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:31,776
Federal death penalty

2079
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,544
The defense for that

2080
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,360
Whatever

2081
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:42,272
Like I don't know this to be a hundred percent sure but everything I understand about his earlier position

2082
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:48,928
I think they'll be very anti inline with his

2083
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:53,024
More libertarian stances

2084
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,656
Shouldn't be allowed to heal it

2085
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
Who gives a s***

2086
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,776
What are you doing

2087
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
This is nuts

2088
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,336
And

2089
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,360
Then this next

2090
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,384
Clarify

2091
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,808
Earlier I mentioned that he needs to leave

2092
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
Substantiate

2093
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
Yes yes

2094
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,672
It is like whip I'm thankful that

2095
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
Rise

2096
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:22,720
Sort of

2097
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:28,608
Come out last week

2098
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,168
White people are racist

2099
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,216
Hollywood show that

2100
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,544
Still a little statistics

2101
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,848
Yeah 10 times chance

2102
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,456
Actor Rob Blackburn

2103
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:46,784
Got 10 times chance of your black being killed by blacks

2104
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
Doesn't mean

2105
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:55,744
Believes it's okay to do

2106
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,584
But you see how they played games with the statistics

2107
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,496
He's playing a game here

2108
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
Talking about

2109
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:11,104
It's almost breathtakingly unsettling

2110
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,920
Do your Alex makes literally no differentiation

2111
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,456
Between white supremacist groups

2112
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:19,296
He hears the FBI director say that whites

2113
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,600
Supremacist groups are committing more violent

2114
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:27,232
Alex reports that is that he thinks the FBI director is saying that white people are bad enough

2115
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,000
Fret

2116
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,048
I don't think it's an unfair reading of that

2117
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,328
To say that Alex Jones

2118
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,144
Supremacist

2119
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,448
Thanks that's a deeply disturbing

2120
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,728
To hear from someone who's

2121
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,776
So clearly into white identity

2122
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,568
Yeah we

2123
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,104
Yeah yeah

2124
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,896
You are

2125
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,176
What was it

2126
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,528
Was it the crossover episode

2127
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:53,600
You said he thought we were race traitors and

2128
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,256
Yeah probably

2129
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,704
Which is funny because just before that that's

2130
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,240
Exactly what he was doing exactly

2131
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:16,640
Crimes that were specifically motivated

2132
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:19,968
Not crimes that white people do wearing on white person

2133
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:20,736
Who is the victim

2134
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:24,576
If a white guy robbed someone who happens to be black and in the process kills them

2135
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:27,392
That's not necessarily a crime motivated by whites

2136
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:29,440
Supremacy so wouldn't be included

2137
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,208
Statistics

2138
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,280
It's very easy to understand Elementary School

2139
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,096
Operating on this

2140
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,888
Completely infantile level

2141
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:42,240
Peter doesn't know anything about what he's talking about

2142
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
Does

2143
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,360
It kind of makes sense why you always screams by the mainstream media thinks the public is dumb

2144
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:51,456
It's really just him projecting his own feelings but haven't cultivated such a stupid

2145
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Critical audio

2146
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,272
Yeah I imagine Stefan molyneux feel

2147
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,856
Probably bangs head on that vent alot

2148
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:02,208
The Bureau of Justice statistics released a report in 2017 that analyze connections

2149
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,256
Between violent crime offenders and violent crimes

2150
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,888
They found that your overwhelmingly more likely to be the victim of a violent crime perpetrated by a person of the

2151
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,656
The same race

2152
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,448
Then by someone of a dick

2153
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:17,312
If you're white you're four times more likely to be the victim of white-on-white crime then

2154
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:22,176
What is not true and it is a racist talking

2155
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:22,944
Pinpoint

2156
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,016
This is just super racist s*** that Alex is saying on its face

2157
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:28,576
This is that what this is is a misuse of

2158
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,880
The name of creative

2159
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,416
Which is used

2160
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:35,488
Deflect attention away from the very real fact

2161
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,584
Video identified 50

2162
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
Extremist related murders in

2163
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
In the United States

2164
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,400
2018

2165
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,424
The highest number since

2166
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,448
1995

2167
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,264
When the Oklahoma City bombing happened

2168
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:50,080
And this is a 35% increase

2169
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
27th

2170
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,688
Every single one of those extremists related murders

2171
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,968
Was carried out by extremists

2172
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
With links to right-wing

2173
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,272
All of the

2174
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:02,112
When FBI director Ray gets up and says they're singing

2175
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:04,416
In cases involving white supremacy related violence

2176
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
That's why

2177
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,720
There are more cases

2178
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,000
Because there are more crimes

2179
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,536
Alex knows

2180
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:12,096
That he can't have this conversation on realtor

2181
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:15,424
Because reality does show that right-wing white supremacy

2182
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,472
Motivated

2183
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,568
It's not surprising that he chooses to move the goalposts

2184
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:23,104
Listen to outright racist talk

2185
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,152
Pinpoint like black-on-white crime

2186
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,944
It's because he's a huge racist

2187
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:30,272
Another thing I was probably doesn't want addresses a reason

2188
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,064
Study that came after University of North

2189
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:37,440
Researchers compared counties were Trump held his rallies in 20

2190
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,232
Completely copper Full Count

2191
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,560
With similar populations racial demographics location

2192
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,608
Level of known active hate groups

2193
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
Etcetera

2194
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:49,216
They found the counties that hosted a trump rally so I quote 226

2195
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:51,264
6% increase in reported hate crimes

2196
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,800
Over similar

2197
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,568
Not hold a rally

2198
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:55,360
But that's probably a coincidence

2199
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,664
Or maybe maybe Jordan

2200
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:04,064
It's just that the globalist reported a ton of fake hate crimes in the counties were Trump held his rally so some political science professors could uncover this

2201
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,344
62 years later

2202
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,928
That's probably what happened that I think would happen

2203
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:13,536
How works

2204
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:24,544
So if you need to

2205
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,336
I think we all at this point probably need

2206
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:28,896
Need to get this out like a little bit of a pallet

2207
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:34,016
We're all. Feeling great probably a little bit mad at Alex think he's doing a terrible job

2208
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:36,320
So if we want some shot

2209
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,856
Freud just a little bit

2210
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,672
I invite you all to enjoy

2211
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,976
What I'm going to describe as one of the least

2212
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,024
Inspired plugs I've ever heard him

2213
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,584
Other talk show host plug-in recycle

2214
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,400
Everybody knows the real advertising is during the show

2215
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,192
Whatever

He doesn't answer I don't think I have a clip of

2229
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,232
It's the anniversary of him getting banned

01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:14,880
List Acosta t-swizzle alike

2237
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:17,952
This is ridiculous

2238
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:18,976
Jesus Christ

2239
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,192
They do not have

2240
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,008
To be a chore

2241
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:33,568
Calls

2242
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:37,152
I'm playing this call because

2243
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
You should

2244
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,968
Mad cuz we should all be afraid

2245
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,528
Very very afraid yeah

2246
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:48,928
I'm afraid of this caller is it actually f****** Anders Breivik I don't know if he has

2247
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,464
Rhythm

2248
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,256
Although it is very nice out

2249
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,816
But

2250
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,864
I meant secondarily

2251
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,936
The fact that Alex doesn't hang up on him immediately also scares

2252
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,240
Are you doing Alex

2253
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,008
Hey Brother

2254
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:07,616
Hey man I have experienced this myself and I was ready for it

2255
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,408
I was going to stop at Natick

2256
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,944
Program in the army

2257
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:14,784
I should say that he's talking about that the idea that these shooters are mine

2258
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,136
Stomach

2259
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:22,720
So I'd already been through something similar to what they're doing to these people

2260
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:26,560
And you can YouTube targeted individual

2261
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:30,400
And just look at the people that are giving their testimony there

2262
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:33,984
And it'll show you how this mindheim technology

2263
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:40,384
It's creating transhumanist which all of them all of the media is transgender

2264
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,784
House at Aurora shooter

2265
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:54,720
That is a misdirection I guarantee you everybody has this nanotechnology that's driving these people

2266
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:55,488
These days

2267
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,512
And if you want to

2268
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,584
This is going back and forth

2269
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,144
You got these different Nano mafias

2270
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,472
And everybody tries to pin it on the other people with technology

2271
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:09,568
Little details in there like that that's that people up

2272
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:12,896
And it goes back and forth back and forth and nobody wants to talk

2273
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,688
Because of fairies all level

2274
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,760
Deal with this technology

2275
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:20,576
Tried to turn me into an operative

2276
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,856
And if you ever want somebody

2277
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,624
View

2278
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:29,024
Interview and tell you exactly how this stuff operates I'll be more than happy to do it Allison trouble

2279
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:36,960
I know that's a brush-off

2280
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:37,728
Jesus

2281
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:49,760
That are small in context clues

2282
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,552
Everybody's got a

2283
01:51:54,112 --> 01:52:00,256
Control certain people controls

2284
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:04,096
Joseph using people whose

2285
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:09,472
Against each other

2286
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:13,056
I know you just talkin about how everybody in the media is trans

2287
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,336
Well that's in there too

2288
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,640
Of course of course

2289
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:21,248
Sure

2290
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:27,648
Is the DARPA

2291
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,768
You know

2292
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,584
It would have been fun

2293
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:42,240
It would have been fun I want to hear that call on a show in 2009

2294
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:45,312
Show the barn

2295
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,384
Papert Superior

2296
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:53,504
You showed up and he said I've never heard of a shooter who was on

2297
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,296
Who wasn't on psych meds

2298
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,576
And now as we

2299
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,624
Close the interview with Tom pappert

2300
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,904
Here's his tone

2301
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:03,488
He's ever so slightly the way he's presenting

2302
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,256
The information

2303
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:11,168
It's irresponsible to not point out that every major Mass shooter again the information is not come out about these two most recent Skype

2304
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:14,496
Every single Mass shooter has been on some type of

2305
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,776
Prescription

2306
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:20,640
Mind-altering chemicals in SSRI antidepressants

2307
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:27,040
So the first time he was saying I've never heard of one who wasn't I don't know

2308
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:30,368
Virtually all of them it's irresponsible to not point out the trash

2309
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,160
Virtual

2310
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:38,560
CC the ever so slight but it's also making it much more of a

2311
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,864
Declarative

2312
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:46,496
They'll front you you act like that to a narrative

2313
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,032
Set it up

2314
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,056
And then say it

2315
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,128
With a slightly different variation

2316
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
Cover-your-ass

2317
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:58,016
So we got one last clip of Alex here from this day forth show August

2318
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:03,648
The beginning of the show he almost doesn't bring up the Dayton shooting

2319
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
At all

2320
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:06,464
Really weird

2321
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:11,328
I think it's a little bit weird thoughts on it

2322
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,656
So I would do as we go over

2323
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:15,936
The next episode

2324
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:18,752
Closes the show

2325
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:22,336
I think I don't know why

2326
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,128
I think it's upset

2327
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,296
Whether or not visit

2328
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:35,392
This isn't the way Alex wants to present that his mind

2329
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:37,952
And that to me is just

2330
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:38,720
Deeply

2331
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:39,488
Deeply

2332
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:42,048
I'm a selfish person I'll tell you

2333
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,352
The enemy is attacking

2334
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,376
All my family

2335
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:50,240
But the monster attacking all my family

2336
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,592
People just pray for my family that would be really good

2337
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,128
It's just my family

2338
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,784
Inos

2339
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
Like

2340
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,208
How to get burned up right now

2341
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,000
My family

2342
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,216
Because it's really painful

2343
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:23,008
Temple Run

2344
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,616
We're never going to get across the line if we don't put our family on the line does that make sense

2345
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:31,968
I'm fighting for my 10 year-old that's for sure I'm fighting for my son and his future

2346
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,296
That's really f*****

2347
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:41,184
I don't I don't I really really really don't like the minds that that's being

2348
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,488
Stat there because whether or not Alex

2349
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:45,536
You're about that in terms of his family

2350
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,304
Who knows

2351
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,352
You could just be bluffing and talking

2352
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,400
Braggadocious

2353
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:52,448
At the end of the day there aren't real steak

2354
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:57,824
He's not up against the kind of f****** New World Order One World Government

2355
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:01,152
Some kind of like trying to take him out

2356
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,176
Nothing like

2357
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,712
Uno's

2358
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,992
Did all this is

2359
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:07,040
Entertainment in performing

2360
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:08,320
So

2361
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,928
What but that's the thing is like

2362
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:18,560
I can't say with any certainty whether or not he believes his own narratives enough to actually be

2363
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,584
Be feeling that way

2364
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,632
Or whether it's entirely performative

2365
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,424
Uno

2366
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,984
Is there talking like that

2367
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,544
He is making it okay for his audience

2368
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,312
It's to feel like

2369
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:33,664
Yeah he is normal

2370
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:39,296
In this community as you are struggle

2371
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,576
I am so

2372
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:45,696
You need to get yourself to a point where you families can burn if they got it

2373
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,464
Yeah

2374
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,912
A plea fit in with his hole

2375
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,984
Fighting a holy war

2376
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:58,752
Situation

2377
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:02,592
Like if God is involved and God knows everything and your family gets

2378
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:05,920
That means that your family was meant to get taken away and you should

2379
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,712
It's still be willing to sacrifice everything

2380
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:10,272
Because God is there for you and they're going to get there

2381
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:14,112
Reward in heaven which is totally not

2382
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,648
Completely different reward and

2383
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,952
IAAI

2384
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:22,304
I don't know it's unsettling it's unsettling

2385
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:26,400
It's probably one of the longest times we've spent on

2386
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:28,192
Sunday episode

2387
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:28,960
Because

2388
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,008
Alex is grappling

2389
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:33,312
To try and understand how to purr

2390
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,872
After the shooting in El Paso

2391
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,968
Because of the

2392
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:41,248
The freshness of it

2393
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,016
Because of

2394
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:44,064
How you operate

2395
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,600
It really see a lot of illuminate

2396
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,648
Points about how this propaganda work

2397
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:48,672
I think it's

2398
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,512
I think it's worthwhile to take the time to get into

2399
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,328
About how

2400
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,608
Lego death

2401
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:58,656
Thought that keeps coming into my head is

2402
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,680
How many

2403
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:00,960
The US

2404
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:01,728
Put put on a cut

2405
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,592
How many f******

2406
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,360
Thanks

2407
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:12,736
H2 got maybe an embargo

2408
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:18,112
F*** this is so much

2409
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,648
There's a lot to get into

2410
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,952
Side issues

2411
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:23,232
To the

2412
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,304
I think they all decide issues

2413
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,096
Kind of relate back a little bit

2414
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,144
To the mindset that Alex is in

2415
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,936
And how this is unfolding

2416
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:35,520
There wasn't really a good option in front of me

2417
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,824
But I also knew there was more news

2418
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,896
Had to

2419
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:43,456
Be aware of more of the fullness

2420
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:46,016
The situation of the multiple events

2421
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:49,344
It's always felt like it would be an incomplete thing

2422
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,368
If we didn't get into the

2423
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,928
So I was struggling with it and I thought

2424
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,976
Okay maybe we should do two episodes

2425
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,000
Then put them both out on

2426
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:56,768
On Wednesday

2427
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:59,072
Yeah and what I decided is that stupid

2428
01:58:59,328 --> 01:58:59,840
Let's do a long a

2429
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:04,960
Yeah we're going to do two and put them out on the same day

2430
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,752
Started getting into that I realized

2431
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:09,568
It's so much of it would be relying on things we talked about

2432
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:13,152
It in the coverage of the fourth it didn't make sense

2433
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,432
So anyway

2434
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,480
Play maybe do a couple policy

2435
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:21,344
Interlude music

2436
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:26,464
Gabbard

2437
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:29,792
So here is Alex starting out the 5th

2438
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,328
Monday episode

2439
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:53,856
I don't know

2440
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:57,184
What's going on in El Paso

2441
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:01,024
Okay

2442
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:04,864
His music is taking a while it's not all of it there safe

2443
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:09,216
Full minute of Music at the beginning

2444
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:15,616
I don't really know what's going on so I think that's a part of

2445
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:17,664
Special Report

2446
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,016
Special Report

2447
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,808
I think they just played a bunch of music

2448
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:24,832
Probably Alex is like

2449
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:29,952
Yeah fukin place but I don't want to do the five minutes but doesn't go out on those radio station

2450
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:30,976
F*** it

2451
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,256
Play John Brown's report

2452
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,280
Barium

2453
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,560
So

2454
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:39,424
I just like that jam 2

2455
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:44,288
It certainly no Policy of Truth

2456
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:45,568
It's so pretty good

2457
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:51,200
So we get back into this episode Alex comes in he's actually in studio and

2458
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,832
I'm here where Alex once again

2459
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,368
Needs to deflect from

2460
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,392
The fact there is

2461
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,416
This gun violence

2462
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:01,952
He's shooting

2463
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:04,000
Any does sell by point

2464
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,024
Again

2465
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:10,144
Most of the deaths were caused by firearms and Mexico has a complete

2466
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:13,472
On the civilian ownership of firearms

2467
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:17,312
Mexico has a crime

2468
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:20,384
That is the second-highest in the world

2469
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,432
Guatemala

2470
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,224
It also has a

2471
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,504
Total ban on guns

2472
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,040
So

2473
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:33,184
Alex is playing really fast and loose here again like he's really responsible with a lot of these

2474
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:33,952
Sites

2475
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,488
Anything like what is he saying

2476
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:41,120
The crime rate in Mexico is the second-highest in the world is that the gun rate gun death rate

2477
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,656
Is he saying both

2478
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,704
It's unclear what he say

2479
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:47,776
I'm not too positive that I care to compare countries by crime

2480
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,336
I just don't know if that's a really productive

2481
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,616
Statistics uses a measuring

2482
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,920
Different countries have different laws

2483
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:55,200
Do something at the crime in country

2484
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:57,248
They might not be and Country be

2485
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,528
Similarly different

2486
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:01,600
Countries have variably functional criminal justice system

2487
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,136
And degrees is

2488
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:03,904
Systematic corrupt

2489
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,464
And so I'm not positive the compare and crime rate

2490
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,256
This is going to be the best use of our time

2491
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:12,096
Also even if you met

2492
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:13,632
Mexico's crime rate is

2493
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:14,912
Second highest in the world

2494
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:17,728
Guatemala number one

2495
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:20,544
Did Alex forget how many countries there are in the world

2496
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,896
He forget about all the countries in Africa and the Middle East that he loves to demonize so much

2497
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,176
Like what is he doing

2498
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:30,272
Ba specious and

2499
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,296
Stupid

2500
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,344
To even bring that up just be

2501
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,648
Because that is like saying well

2502
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,464
He's not talking about a country's talking about it

2503
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:42,304
He's not saying Mexico has a crime problem

2504
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,328
He sang Mexican

2505
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,352
Have a prime

2506
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:48,960
Contract with his other

2507
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:51,520
Yeah but I mean now he's

2508
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:58,944
It's off the top of the Dome I guess it's like whatever whatever is in front of my face identity

2509
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,480
Anytime I can remember and then

2510
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,504
Beyond that

2511
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:07,136
No idea where Alex is getting his numbers from Mexico

2512
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,440
Because he never

2513
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:16,864
Dover data from NPR tons of new stories the Journal of the American Medical Association and none of

2514
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,400
Come close to matching what he saying

2515
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,192
I do not accept his point

2516
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:22,240
Which is

2517
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:25,568
Countries like under it

2518
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:28,384
Chicago and it's totally legal

2519
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:34,016
It doesn't matter all this is seriously

2520
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:36,832
Because we don't get all bent out of shape every time someone in Mexico get

2521
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,136
Sort of

2522
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:43,488
How many people absolutely should care a lot about the violence in other countries and particularly Weezer

2523
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:46,048
You should care about the ways in which our country's foreign policy

2524
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:47,328
Is affecting the violence

2525
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,096
Thanos country

2526
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,888
I think there's a lot of credible

2527
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:50,912
Credible

2528
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,960
After speaking on this topic

2529
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,752
And I just don't think that Alex

2530
02:03:55,008 --> 02:04:00,128
A guy who overtly supports bolsonaro has been vocally in favor of Venezuela

2531
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,664
Is the sort of guy I want to listen

2532
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:04,480
Bolsonaro who came out

2533
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:07,040
And said that he hopes all criminals are shot dead in the sky

2534
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:13,440
Every single f****** thing that Alex

2535
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,720
Is about everything

2536
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,512
Is America first

2537
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:20,096
Everything is about our sovereignty in the rest of the world

2538
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,376
And tell the conversation

2539
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,656
Becomes about gun violence

2540
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,472
So weird

2541
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,008
So weird

2542
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,544
So weird

2543
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,640
Sew-ins next clip

2544
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:33,664
He begins

2545
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,712
To finally talk about

2546
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,736
The shooting in

2547
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,576
Of course it's just

2548
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,344
Deflection

2549
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,672
Trying really hard

2550
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,464
Thai the El Paso and Dayton

2551
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,488
Shootings together

2552
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:54,656
Every case where they have social media that were able to see

2553
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:58,240
These shooters are

2554
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:01,568
Video games

2555
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,616
They all basically look the same

2556
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,920
And you're in

2557
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:08,480
Occult

2558
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
Almost all of them

2559
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:17,440
Those another computer computer

2560
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,888
Well guess what

2561
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,640
Christians

2562
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:46,624
Ear protection all the rest of it just like the other shooter

2563
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,696
El Paso

2564
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:51,488
Texas isn't that a

2565
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,280
Isn't that interesting

2566
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:58,144
So one thing I find very interesting about these two shooting happening in

2567
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,704
Span of a few days was that it offered a really in

2568
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,984
Glimpse into how

2569
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,264
Groups of people taken in

2570
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,032
Information

2571
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:09,920
When the information was coming out in the case of the El Paso shooter that he'd been involved

2572
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:12,224
Yeah there was a lot of posts on it

2573
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,760
That he'd released a man

2574
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:17,344
Manifesto clearly laying out that he was doing the shooting as a political

2575
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,904
Against the immigrants we thought were invading the country

2576
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,928
There was a response

2577
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:21,952
He was a terrorist

2578
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:24,768
Wilshire

2579
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:31,424
Putting out that management is 100%

2580
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:34,240
I think there's good reason to believe that

2581
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:36,544
Even if it's not 100%

2582
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,312
Concrete Lady

2583
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,848
But it

2584
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:41,152
Rihanna side

2585
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:45,248
That was the conversations before I think there is it clear

2586
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:47,296
Motivation that was behind it

2587
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:55,744
That the rhetoric was nearly identical in Fox News

2588
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,352
They probably would have said Alex Jones to but no one really cares too much about him anymore except us

2589
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,656
They pointed to train two people online

2590
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:06,752
Particularly on a radicalized each other friend

2591
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,592
6 stops here unless we take

2592
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,360
Taken seriously

2593
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,920
People in the right-wing world worth defense

2594
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:16,224
As we saw in the last episode of Power

2595
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,504
Because of course

2596
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:20,064
This is an important distinction

2597
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:23,648
I don't think that anyone I saw commenting on this was really trying to

2598
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:29,280
Connect the El Paso shooter to Trump in the world of right-wing propaganda based on superficial similarities

2599
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:33,888
It's not like he wore a Maga hat in one picture and everyone is like a hot that's why you did

2600
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:39,264
The connection was made because in that Manifesto was clearly expressed why he did the shooting

2601
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,032
And the reason

2602
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,824
Route for doing it

2603
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:45,408
Essential talking point of all these bright Wikipedia

2604
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:49,760
The demographics fear Pari propaganda of Americans

2605
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,296
Being replaced by Eminem

2606
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,088
Chris is the bread-and-butter of Alex Jones

2607
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,368
Talking points

2608
02:07:55,648 --> 02:08:00,768
I was call turning point to talk to you outside

2609
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:01,792
The important

2610
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:03,584
Connection is that the guy

2611
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,168
Isn't the guy possibly like Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson

2612
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:13,824
He said he was motivated to commit his crime by the same erroneous and white nationalist rhetoric that they make a living off.

2613
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,384
When the Dayton shooting happen

2614
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:20,992
It was very interesting to see how these very same groups responded to a different set of circumstances

2615
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:28,160
Again I'm not saying Universal claim that every person on each side of the ideological Spectrum

2616
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:28,928
Certain way

2617
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:32,512
But generally what I saw was one side go180

2618
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,536
And the other side were play

2619
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,888
What information started to come out that the shooter in Dayton wasn't the right wing

2620
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:41,216
Extremists worried about the invasion in quotes of Emigrant

2621
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:43,264
And his politics might have been to the left

2622
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:47,360
The right-wing propaganda Steaua running interference for Trump a day earlier

2623
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:49,664
Just because he loved

2624
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:53,504
Is there guilty for the shooting flip the script and started saying

2625
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:00,416
The surface-level details were in their favor on this one

2626
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,696
They always do

2627
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:08,608
Conversely what I saw four people on the left was the exact same level of horror and heartbreak

2628
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:10,656
That they felt for the people in El Paso

2629
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:12,192
But with a layer of introspection

2630
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,288
There was an acceptance that just because this person is on your side

2631
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:18,080
Sensibly politically

2632
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:18,848
It doesn't mean

2633
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:20,640
Also be a murderer

2634
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,432
I saw people trying to make sense of

2635
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:27,040
Throughout the day as more information became available a clear picture took shape

2636
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:30,368
It became increasingly clear that the shooter was a dangerous misogynist

2637
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:33,184
A classmate of his from high school told The Daily Beast

2638
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:36,256
She called the police after he started she started

2639
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,584
From him about how she was on his quote raped

2640
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,888
She told The Daily Beast quote

2641
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,448
I was not surprised at all when I heard his name on the news

2642
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:46,496
Yesterday we all predicted you would do this

2643
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:49,056
When she called the police

2644
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:52,128
Back in high school he got a slap on the wrist over the threat

2645
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,944
And because they weren't taken more seriously

2646
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:55,712
And processed

2647
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,760
Didn't go through you still able to buy guns

2648
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,088
For the most part I saw people taking stock

2649
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:04,160
Even in presumably Progressive community

2650
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:06,976
There's still a lot of underdressed and under address

2651
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:07,744
Problems

2652
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,840
Misogyny is not a right left Rob Lowe and I saw many people taking note of this

2653
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:12,608
And discussing

2654
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,144
I don't know

2655
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:17,472
Like you might have had an Undiscovered Manifesto about metaphor

2656
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,752
Medicare for all

2657
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:22,592
Being behind his shooting

2658
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:23,360
Fear the date

2659
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,896
Shooting was motivated by his father

2660
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:26,432
Which is a big display

2661
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,480
It's not really a productive day

2662
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,016
Discussion just a note who did

2663
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,064
It's important to get into the Y

2664
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:33,856
It really feels.

2665
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,392
Deeply inappropriate to make

2666
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:36,160
Could be situations

2667
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:36,928
Analogous

2668
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:38,464
The way Alex is doing

2669
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:39,232
To make them

2670
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,536
I researched on a killing spree

2671
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:43,328
Buddhist podcast

2672
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,912
Kind of fits more into the mold of the non-political version

2673
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,448
Which is to say that

2674
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,008
There's a History of Violence directed towards women

2675
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:53,568
From everything I can tell that

2676
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,592
What's going on here

2677
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:56,384
Yeah it's a

2678
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,176
Truth that we've mentioned

2679
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:02,528
Over and over and over again

2680
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,320
There's usually violence

2681
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:07,904
If not always it's always a very high

2682
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:08,928
Yeah

2683
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:12,768
Pure that this

2684
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:14,816
Is more of the story

2685
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:15,584
He had

2686
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:16,864
Left opinion

2687
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:20,448
Yeah and that's something that we all have to we have to Grapple

2688
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,752
We have to understand that do you know

2689
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:24,288
Agreeing on

2690
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,568
Political issues

2691
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,592
Necessarily

2692
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,640
That means that everybody is on

2693
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:29,408
The same page

2694
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:34,272
Right-wing propaganda. Working hard to make these two shooting

2695
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:36,320
Equivalent

2696
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:40,160
I know it's not new Behavior but the way they pivoted from defense

2697
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,696
And deflection about El Paso

2698
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,976
Go to feigned moral outrage

2699
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,560
For someone like me

2700
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:50,400
It really seems to me that the sort of behavior only really make sense

2701
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:52,192
The context of these propaganda

2702
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:52,960
Fully aware

2703
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:55,776
That their rhetoric and worldview that they're perpetuating

2704
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:59,104
Maybe behind the El Paso shooting and they need to

2705
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:00,640
To protect themselves

2706
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:02,176
From that reality B

2707
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:08,320
I didn't see any prominent voices on the left arguing that the Dayton shooter was a false flag because he agree to some

2708
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,088
Some of their politics

2709
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:13,696
I didn't see anyone insisted that he must be a killer who did what he did to demonize the left

2710
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:16,256
We can never pass the green New Deal

2711
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,584
Because I want to make this abundant

2712
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,352
We clear

2713
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,632
These people like Alex

2714
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:25,216
Do not question things and come up with insanely stupid conspiracy theories

2715
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:27,008
Because they're questioning

2716
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,800
They do it because they're trying

2717
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:31,104
Cover up and deny the real-world consequences

2718
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,128
The come from having it

2719
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:34,432
Rising extremist right-wing media

2720
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:38,528
Without that extremist right-wing media most of these people have nothing

2721
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,808
So they need to protect

2722
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:43,136
Like like legitimately

2723
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:45,440
Without this white nationalist wave that he's riding

2724
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:51,328
That's an extreme example because even with Addie's nobody

2725
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,864
Game but he's running

2726
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:53,888
Who is Jacob Wohl

2727
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:54,912
Who's Scott Adams

2728
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:56,192
Gilbert

2729
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:58,752
Granny's motherfuker

2730
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:01,824
The relevance in revenues rely on the porch

2731
02:13:02,336 --> 02:13:02,848
Cannabis extremist

2732
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:03,616
Ray with media

2733
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:05,664
So they protect it no matter what

2734
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,968
And I don't see that similar Behavior being

2735
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:08,992
Engaged

2736
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:10,016
As it relates to

2737
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:11,296
People on the west

2738
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:12,832
With a date

2739
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,720
I see circumstances being dealt with AIDS

2740
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:20,256
They are

2741
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:21,280
From people like

2742
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,816
The right-wing propaganda

2743
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,608
Yep

2744
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:27,936
I mean I don't know I don't know what else to

2745
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,472
Stay other than

2746
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,008
At this point

2747
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:31,776
In time it's kind

2748
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:32,800
Pretty cool

2749
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,080
Obviously

2750
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,360
The right-wing

2751
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:37,920
Shootings

2752
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:44,064
Maybe maybe ten years ago we could have had a different

2753
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,856
Maybe that's a

2754
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,880
Prince story

2755
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:49,952
At this point in time there is nothing else to say but

2756
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:51,232
They are complicit

2757
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,256
It's it's

2758
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:53,024
It's horrifying

2759
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,120
Clear I think I did

2760
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:59,936
You know I saw some people in the initial

2761
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:01,984
Right after the

2762
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:02,752
I'm shooting

2763
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:05,568
That it was

2764
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,336
Supremacist

2765
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:09,408
Part of that is because

2766
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,944
We just had a white supremacist

2767
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:11,712
Shooting

2768
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:15,040
6 hours before their offense

2769
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,624
Those indicate a lot of times that is a

2770
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:21,696
People

2771
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:23,744
That we're making those

2772
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,024
Speculation

2773
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:27,584
Generally I saw Corrections

2774
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:30,144
After it turned out that it wasn't

2775
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:32,192
Steph

2776
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:33,472
Other people

2777
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:35,264
Part there's like let's not

2778
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:38,336
Assume what motivations are there

2779
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:40,128
Until there's more information

2780
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:41,152
I just

2781
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,176
I don't

2782
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:42,944
I don't

2783
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,224
I do not see that

2784
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,504
From people who are

2785
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,552
Associated with Infowars

2786
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,832
Icy intention

2787
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,112
Behind weather doing

2788
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:53,696
It really bums me out but it is interesting

2789
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:57,024
I'm horrified about the events

2790
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,304
Could have happened I feel

2791
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,840
Terribly for the people

2792
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:01,888
In Dayton and El Paso and everywhere else

2793
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:03,424
Been touched by the

2794
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:05,472
I know that there's some listeners that we

2795
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,520
We have to or from those places

2796
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,312
It's just awful

2797
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,848
I don't know

2798
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:11,616
I don't know

2799
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:16,992
It is

2800
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:19,296
Something that I have also been thing

2801
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:21,600
To what

2802
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:25,440
Have we

2803
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,464
Helped create

2804
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,792
You and me

2805
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:33,376
No I mean no everyone

2806
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:35,680
Constant capitulation

2807
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,960
Of like

2808
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:41,312
Okay we need to stop and think about how the right wing

2809
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:42,080
He's going to take this

2810
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,872
Process

2811
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,640
Does to me

2812
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,432
Has been one of the

2813
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:47,968
Sleeper factors in

2814
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,504
Creating all of this

2815
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:53,600
Constantly

2816
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:58,464
What do they think about sex

2817
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:04,864
The problem seriously but it would be seen as being

2818
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:06,656
Like every step of the way

2819
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:09,216
We have enabled them by

2820
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:11,264
Considering their feelings

2821
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,800
Above there

2822
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:17,920
How can we how else can we put it other than to say

2823
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:20,224
We don't want to say this

2824
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:26,624
Because they'll get angry about it and so now we are allowing them now we're not pushing through Duncan

2825
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:32,768
Obama we don't put single help because they're going to demonize.

2826
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:37,632
It's on the right to create a compromise

2827
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:41,472
We want to create this compromise where one does not exist for them

2828
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:43,776
They are not negotiating table

2829
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:45,312
They are not negotiate

2830
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:51,456
This is not a negotiation this is not something where it is an absolute

2831
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,016
And they are holding all of us

2832
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,064
Can't

2833
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:01,696
I don't want it I don't want to go too far because we had this conversation

2834
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:05,280
Although when I went too far back then I was

2835
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:12,960
Perigold be fairly accurate

2836
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:15,008
True but it's it's hard not to

2837
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:18,080
Describe a certain amount of desire to these people

2838
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:23,200
Does Viola hard not to say that mr. Connell what's another mess

2839
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:26,272
But it might not know might not be

2840
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:27,552
The primary thing that's

2841
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:31,392
Desired unfortunately caused

2842
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,952
It's grim

2843
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:34,720
It's G

2844
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:35,488
Grimchef

2845
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:38,560
Alex talked about

2846
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:40,096
Shooter

2847
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:41,376
And Dayton's appearance

2848
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,472
Whatever

2849
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:48,032
Evil eyes

2850
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:52,896
Always got that weird lazy satisfied look like

2851
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:56,480
That's the look they all got sick

2852
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,760
Enjoyable look

2853
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:00,064
How much he loves Elizabeth Warren

2854
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:02,880
How much he loves Bernie Sanders

2855
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:06,464
I want to kill fascist and he loves antifa

2856
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,536
I can't wait to go to hell

2857
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:10,816
Ensure

2858
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:14,400
Almost

2859
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,192
Every one of them

2860
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,264
Is it the same thing

2861
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,568
But I thought they all were the children of psychologists

2862
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:25,408
To be one of the larger overriding things about the date

2863
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:32,064
Shooting and I talked about it nearly as much as you might expect

2864
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,832
He is

2865
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:38,208
Clearly on his social media accounts indicate

2866
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:42,560
It has left politics what you wanted dance on

2867
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:43,584
Instead heater

2868
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,864
Turn to Jeff.

2869
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,888
It's all about him being

2870
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:54,848
But the only thing I think it's super important about that club is

2871
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:55,872
How

2872
02:18:56,128 --> 02:19:02,272
He operates it's like when there's a right-wing guy who's into Trump and you know loved Alex or was a huge bench

2873
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:07,392
Shapiro's Deli platters

2874
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:12,512
The Santee. Class is Elizabeth Warren

2875
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:14,816
Bet that's a behavior

2876
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:18,144
And the thing that

2877
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:19,680
And you can hear

2878
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:21,216
That

2879
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,240
That

2880
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:23,008
Level of

2881
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:23,776
Glee

2882
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:28,896
Look at look at me I can do my voice

2883
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:33,760
Yesterday when it was a right-wing terrorist I had to work

2884
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:36,320
The deflection but now today I get to be like

2885
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:39,904
He wanted to kill your children and he wanted to eat

2886
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:44,768
You know what else do you spirals

2887
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:47,840
Episode

2888
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,728
I show up and I'm expecting like

2889
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:56,544
Just nothing but dancing all Democrats

2890
02:19:58,592 --> 02:20:03,968
There's your boy

2891
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:07,040
There's a big issue I'm going to tackle first

2892
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:15,744
What's an internal

2893
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:18,816
That uses USB

2894
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:22,656
Hotel rooms

2895
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,448
With the guns over 10,000

2896
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:29,312
They flew in from Saudi military

2897
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:30,848
Air Force

2898
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:32,384
Wasabi convention are

2899
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,456
Is in the same Hotel

2900
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:45,440
Embarrassed

2901
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:47,488
This is Ludacris

2902
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:53,120
Fox he just say to me you never heard Alex lay out exactly what

2903
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:56,448
Conspiracy theories about the Las Vegas shooting

2904
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:58,752
He rarely does because that sounds

2905
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:04,128
Not thousands

2906
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:06,432
Are all staying in the same Hotel

2907
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:09,504
Walnut

2908
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:11,552
Yeah that be

2909
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:15,392
Leaving the Mandalay Bay

2910
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:19,744
Got to get some bumps into blowing up on these days

2911
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,304
This is part of like a 4chan

2912
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:28,448
Conspiracy theory the attempted assassination of Solomon

2913
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:33,056
That was supposedly shooting was at

2914
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:33,824
The distraction

2915
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,616
To get people to

2916
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:38,688
Like supposed to be

2917
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:40,224
Or so he thought

2918
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:43,040
To cause the

2919
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,576
They're going to do this shooting closet

2920
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:46,624
Distraction so they could have their assassin

2921
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:48,672
Kill the cramp

2922
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:51,232
Oh okay well

2923
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:55,584
But that's what Alex is sort of cribbing from

2924
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,608
Getting the

2925
02:21:56,864 --> 02:22:00,704
Assassination of MBS out of it

2926
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,472
Embarrassing

2927
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:03,264
Trump is crazy

2928
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:07,360
Trump went to Saudi Arabia in May of 2017 and touch the orb

2929
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:10,176
The Las Vegas shooting wasn't until October 27th

2930
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:12,480
Maybe

2931
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:15,296
What do we got here maybe the orb was the first attempt

2932
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,576
Embarrass Trump

2933
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,368
Work so I had to do Las Vegas

2934
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:19,648
Maybe that's what's going on

2935
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:31,680
There's a middle ground

2936
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:35,776
Motivation did the Saudi government have to want to embarrass Trump

2937
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:42,432
Like when he went to Saudi Arabia he and the King signed a series of letters of intent to fill Saudi 350 billion dollars

2938
02:22:42,688 --> 02:22:44,224
Weapons over the course of the next 10 years

2939
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:47,296
Very consistent about being into Saudi Arabia

2940
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:53,696
Before the Las Vegas shooting after the Las Vegas shooting after Jamal khashoggi got murdered after Congress

2941
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:56,000
Blocked 8 billion dollars in weapons sales

2942
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:59,328
The Saudi back in May

2943
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:04,192
After Congress passed resolutions blocking him from selling arms to Saudi Arabia and concerned about their actions

2944
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:08,032
Yamin back in July and then

2945
02:23:11,872 --> 02:23:12,384
F***

2946
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,944
There's literally no motive for the Saudis to

2947
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:19,552
Concocted an elaborate terrorist attack in the United States to embarrass Trump into doing what they want

2948
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:21,600
Christmas already doing exactly what they want

2949
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:25,184
This is a theory like I said there was circulating on that pole board

2950
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:31,584
You just get store

2951
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:32,352
Shred

2952
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:38,240
Their 1,000 goals in the story not least of which

2953
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:43,616
Is Stephen Paddock was a patsy arm dealer hotel rooms overlooking other music left

2954
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:46,432
Why did you book rooms at hotels in

2955
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:48,736
Chicago Boston another one in Las Vegas

2956
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:50,528
All over looking big tourist

2957
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:52,320
If you was just a guy getting

2958
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,856
Some guns

2959
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:55,392
Why was he doing that s*** for

2960
02:23:55,648 --> 02:24:01,792
It's not like this is even worth exploring Alex you just say that the Saudi Arabians tricked

2961
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,072
Paper trail

2962
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:09,472
To keep people from finding the real truth

2963
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:14,848
Thousand Saturdays

2964
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:20,992
Yeah you said 10,000 Saturdays in Prince MPS and I was like what the f*** out of here I'm not even going to listen

2965
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:21,760
It's nuts

2966
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:23,040
F*** you

2967
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:25,600
Alright we're off track

2968
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,928
We are off

2969
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:35,328
Track 10,000 Saturdays and mbsr hanging out

2970
02:24:35,584 --> 02:24:39,936
25600

2971
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:42,240
I forgot the pipes

2972
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:47,872
Now they're great

2973
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:49,152
Any

2974
02:24:49,408 --> 02:24:50,688
He gets into something very interesting

2975
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,224
Like this is I loved it

2976
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:53,760
Cuz it's

2977
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,808
He's so wrong

2978
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,088
It is amazing

2979
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:59,136
Like he's just so wrong

2980
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:00,416
He couldn't be more wrong

2981
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:05,024
Better chance

2982
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,584
With a Publix been disarmed

2983
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:13,984
Texas

2984
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:18,848
In Detroit

2985
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:23,712
Baltimore Maryland

2986
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:24,736
Oh my

2987
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:28,064
I think that makes

2988
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:34,976
Even though it makes more sense for the opposite to be true

2989
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:38,304
Because you don't have

2990
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:40,864
Well there's some interesting things going on here

2991
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,168
Absolutely no idea what he's talking about

2992
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:49,568
He seems to think that burglaries are happening all the time of these blue cities or the public doesn't have guns

2993
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:51,616
It's not backed up by anyperk

2994
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:55,712
If you spent 10 seconds looking at realize he's a big dumbass hole

2995
02:25:56,224 --> 02:26:01,344
First things first as a chicagoan I feel the need to point out that Chicago doesn't even have the highest burglary rate

2996
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:03,136
In terms of cities in Illinois

2997
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:06,720
That honor goes to Danville

2998
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:09,536
Which is 50 miles closer to Indianapolis

2999
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:10,304
Chicago

3000
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:12,608
Danville is in Vermillion

3001
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:14,912
Which voted 64%

3002
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:17,216
16

3003
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:17,984
Just buy whatever

3004
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:22,336
Do US city that has the highest rate of burglary is Bastrop Louisiana

3005
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:23,872
Which is Morehouse Parish

3006
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:26,176
Which voted 55% for Trump in 20

3007
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:26,944
16

3008
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:32,320
Both US senators from Louisiana Republicans in five out of the six people they send to the House of Representatives

3009
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:34,368
Including Alex's Good Buddies

3010
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,136
Scalise

3011
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:36,160
We're also Republic

3012
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:42,816
The city in the US has the second-highest rate of burglary is Blytheville Arkansas which is weirdly in Mississippi County

3013
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:45,888
Which voted 53.4% for Trump in 2016

3014
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:50,240
Arkansas are Republicans and four out of the four members of the House

3015
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:52,288
Republican

3016
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,824
It is a very red so

3017
02:26:55,104 --> 02:27:00,736
Fourth most burglarized cities in the country are Lumberton and Laurinburg North Carolina

3018
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:05,600
North Carolina was Trump country in 2016 or Republican

3019
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:08,416
Hazard eight of the 11 house members

3020
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:11,488
But you were bacon

3021
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:18,144
You can totally have guns in Louisiana and even get concealed carry permit you can absolutely get all the guns you wanted Arkansas

3022
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,192
Could totally open carry your gun without a permit

3023
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:23,520
You can definitely do guns and concealed carry in North Carolina

3024
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:27,616
I secure life.com websites

3025
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:30,688
Security company 2017 FBI statistics

3026
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:31,456
You know they found

3027
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:34,784
New York is the state with the least burglaries in the country

3028
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:36,832
Chicago's burglary rate isn't even

3029
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:38,112
10% of Bastrop

3030
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:40,672
Slightly lower than Austin

3031
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,464
Nothing Alex is saying mean

3032
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:45,280
Anything he's just making s*** up it feels right to him

3033
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:47,840
He's making a pretty safe bet that no one in his audience

3034
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:51,936
Horsepower to realize he's full of s***

3035
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:53,216
Buddy is full of

3036
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:55,008
He has no idea what he's talking

3037
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:58,080
More often than not he's just sit with no evidence

3038
02:27:58,336 --> 02:28:01,408
To support at least

3039
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:02,432
As he did here

3040
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:03,712
Give me very stupid

3041
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:04,480
Trust this dude

3042
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:05,504
He's a bluffer

3043
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,272
He's bluffing

3044
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:11,904
Like I was looking at some of the people who are experts in the

3045
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:13,952
I don't know

3046
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:16,512
Improve this as early

3047
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:19,840
The urban areas actually have much lower

3048
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:22,400
I want of the reasons is

3049
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,936
Because there's apartment complexes

3050
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:28,032
Which are much more difficult to commit burglary

3051
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:30,848
Well the only thing that makes sense

3052
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:34,432
Where are like the intuitive thought I had is just

3053
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:38,528
There are so many people crammed in together and Abby

3054
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:40,576
Tends to make just enough noise

3055
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:46,976
Is to f****** everybody else's. That's probably in the suburbs or if you're in a small town

3056
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:48,256
In the middle of nowhere

3057
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:54,656
Between you and your floor

3058
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:59,520
You're going to have to go through urine after breaking later it's much easier to break into something

3059
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:03,104
It's just a single unit on a ground-floor that is

3060
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,384
So like there's tons

3061
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,688
Tons of like just dwelling

3062
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:08,480
The super elevated or behind

3063
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:14,880
Multiple walls even our houses are

3064
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:16,416
Walking wall

3065
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:18,720
You know there's a foot of space in between each

3066
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:20,256
Buildings

3067
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:23,584
Have like a entrance is there only acceptable for Courtyard

3068
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,352
Make it like

3069
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:26,144
Why would someone break in your

3070
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:32,032
Completely exposed.

3071
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,640
In the city

3072
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:40,736
But the rates in these

3073
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:41,504
Fink's

3074
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,320
Yeah we're happening in these I mean let's be fair

3075
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:46,624
Mostly predominantly non-white

3076
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:50,464
Popular Baltimore

3077
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,488
Chicago

3078
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:52,256
Yeah

3079
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:55,584
That's the perception that he has

3080
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,376
True it's based on him just making

3081
02:29:57,632 --> 02:29:58,400
Things up on what he

3082
02:29:58,656 --> 02:29:59,424
Assumes

3083
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:00,960
Which

3084
02:30:01,216 --> 02:30:01,728
Like

3085
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:02,496
Honestly

3086
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:04,032
Behaving like that

3087
02:30:04,544 --> 02:30:05,312
To put the

3088
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:06,592
Little bit of a

3089
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:07,616
Asterix

3090
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:09,920
Around most of the things you say

3091
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:14,272
What you can confidently deliver something you're making up

3092
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:16,576
Man u r a

3093
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:17,344
Suspect

3094
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:19,392
Cuz he think

3095
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:20,416
That

3096
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:25,024
I can kind of see where he

3097
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:25,792
Edomites

3098
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:27,328
Feel confident when he's making

3099
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:28,608
Making that up is

3100
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:30,656
If you think that Chicago is

3101
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:32,448
Murder City USA

3102
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:36,800
Then I'm guessing he probably just assumes that if Chicago has a high rate of

3103
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:41,664
Murder then it must have a high rate of every single possible crime

3104
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:45,504
Available doing everything everybody

3105
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,040
Chicago's committing crimes all the

3106
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:52,672
I really love for him to say I assume the Chicago has higher crime rate

3107
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:54,720
Because that would be honest

3108
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:57,280
The fact is it doesn't

3109
02:30:57,536 --> 02:31:03,680
So go f*** yourself Alex Chicago

3110
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:11,104
Yeah.

3111
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:16,992
The new 6 call Q U which one the original Sears

3112
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:20,320
Meet me at the Willis Tower

3113
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:21,600
Doesn't exist

3114
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:24,160
I don't do a good Chicago

3115
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:28,000
Clips

3116
02:31:28,256 --> 02:31:29,280
What are we doing

3117
02:31:29,792 --> 02:31:31,328
Las Vegas shooting

3118
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:32,864
Okay

3119
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,448
Burglaries

3120
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:38,752
Wrong okay

3121
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:41,056
This mixed with blue my f******

3122
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,848
It legitimately I was like

3123
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:43,872
Alex what are you say

3124
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,664
What are you saying

3125
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:46,688
He seems

3126
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:47,456
Tubi

3127
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:51,040
Expressing a desire to go back to a bygone age

3128
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:56,672
Out of the norm for him

3129
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:58,208
What's a specific

3130
02:31:58,464 --> 02:31:59,232
Of the contact

3131
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:00,256
Text me what you talking about

3132
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:01,024
Make me

3133
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,048
Very upset

3134
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:06,912
The Village

3135
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:12,032
The first time they got caught doing something weird and sick

3136
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:14,848
What's up you know what the villagers

3137
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:24,064
It wouldn't put up with his crap

3138
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:31,488
Well with Bob go

3139
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:34,048
Well nobody knows World Bob win

3140
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:41,728
Shooters are show

3141
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:45,056
Christians

3142
02:32:46,848 --> 02:32:47,616
And that

3143
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:52,224
Accept the El Paso shooter

3144
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,016
Picknsave expunged

3145
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:03,232
Was

3146
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:16,800
And soda

3147
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:19,360
It is the accepted fact

3148
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:21,664
That these supposed

3149
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:22,944
Lone shooter

3150
02:33:23,712 --> 02:33:25,760
Paso Texas

3151
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:29,344
For the Trump supporter even though we have all the screenshots

3152
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:30,880
Promise social media

3153
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:36,000
Within 30 minutes

3154
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:42,656
Anybody anybody literally anybody anybody

3155
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:51,360
Calling him out on this

3156
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:57,760
Representing my life as social media is very different

3157
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:59,296
To the Whitepages

3158
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:01,344
Yeah yeah kind of

3159
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:04,416
Profiles

3160
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:13,120
Why I wanted to really drive home

3161
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:14,656
So much of his

3162
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:16,192
Suspicions

3163
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:22,592
Anything that happens can be called into question because of this right misunderstanding but he has about the my life

3164
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:24,128
Profile

3165
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:26,944
Anything you can get away from any kind of

3166
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:27,968
The assertion

3167
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:30,272
This Manifesto is he

3168
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:32,320
You can get away from any

3169
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:33,344
Indications

3170
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:35,136
He had similar beliefs

3171
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:42,304
Misunderstanding

3172
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:43,072
Almost

3173
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:46,144
Almost suspiciously convenient

3174
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:48,192
Let's do it Alex is so goddamn

3175
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:48,960
F***** up

3176
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:52,800
Every time I think I've heard his weirdest position he goes and swing for the fences

3177
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:59,200
And catches me off-guard with something like that would kill people

3178
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:04,832
The lottery the lottery

3179
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:11,488
The part of inclined to just say a community

3180
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:13,792
People breaking their local mores

3181
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:17,632
I think of something at this this is so weird that it deserves a little more analysis

3182
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:19,680
What Alex isn't mentioned

3183
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:25,312
Is that in these Villages presumably in the early days of America

3184
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:27,872
These rules were straight-up Theocratic

3185
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:29,920
In the early 1600s

3186
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:32,992
Edna Virginia

3187
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:33,760
Twice a day

3188
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:35,552
You had to attend church twice a day

3189
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:37,600
If you broke that law three times

3190
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:39,648
You be enslaved for 6 months

3191
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:41,184
Rowing boat

3192
02:35:42,976 --> 02:35:43,744
Humans are stupid

3193
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:49,888
These early systems of Village Justice were not at all what Alex imagines they were weather

3194
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:52,192
Deals with the problem early and then everyone

3195
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:53,216
Feel their lips

3196
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:54,752
Like they're in La costra Nostra

3197
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,288
La Cosa Nostra

3198
02:35:57,056 --> 02:36:02,176
More often than not the people who are the targets of community Justice were such because the community

3199
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:03,200
Just thought they were weird

3200
02:36:03,456 --> 02:36:06,784
Probably because they were gay or just

3201
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:07,808
Social structure that was

3202
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:08,832
Woodforest at the time

3203
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:11,136
The Salem Witch Trials are a great example

3204
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:12,160
This is getting way out of hand

3205
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:15,744
Like many of the victims

3206
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,048
Play by the repressive rules the patriarchy

3207
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:20,352
Google system in The Villages

3208
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:23,680
One of the people who was killed was a woman who married a Slave

3209
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:25,728
Another was a woman who just didn't want to go to church

3210
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:27,520
Neither these going to post a threat

3211
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:29,312
Two others in the way that a mass shooter

3212
02:36:29,568 --> 02:36:32,128
Today and killing them was not an active protected anything

3213
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:34,176
Status quo

3214
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:38,272
Many groups like The First Nations in Mowry in places

3215
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:39,296
The restorative

3216
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:42,368
On the community level

3217
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,392
Involved

3218
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,928
Secretly disappearing people

3219
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:48,512
I think I might be a little different about although an interesting

3220
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:50,048
Idea that they have

3221
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,840
Yeah it is

3222
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:54,144
Unfortunately Toni Morrison

3223
02:36:57,216 --> 02:36:57,728
She is amazing but

3224
02:36:57,984 --> 02:36:58,752
Quote that's going

3225
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:00,800
To paraphrase

3226
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:05,920
If you need to tear somebody else down

3227
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:06,944
Fealty

3228
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:08,480
Problem

3229
02:37:12,832 --> 02:37:13,344
Is that a quote

3230
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,136
No I thought

3231
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:17,440
Turn up

3232
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:19,232
If you take out

3233
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:20,000
Like what

3234
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:21,536
Who sang as plainly as you can

3235
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:24,096
I think we should go back to a system where we

3236
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:27,680
We kill people were suspicious of so they don't have to becoming a problem later

3237
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:28,960
And I got to say

3238
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:34,592
It's an insanely big swing for someone who claims that one of his favorite parts of Western culture is due process

3239
02:37:35,616 --> 02:37:38,432
Sounds kind of like yeah that might just be a buzzword for him

3240
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:42,272
AJ's processing

3241
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:45,600
Easier to solve problems I love you

3242
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:47,904
But we could do away with it

3243
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:53,792
Do away with it process

3244
02:37:54,048 --> 02:37:55,584
F****** time like and now he's like

3245
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:59,680
Yearning for the days when the mob would kill weird people

3246
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:04,800
Yeah I'm confused about why their parents would get along with

3247
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:06,080
Fox

3248
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:07,872
Get out

3249
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:11,456
About

3250
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:12,736
The Monday episode as well as

3251
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:14,784
Sunday

3252
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:17,088
First of all the dissatisfaction with Alex not

3253
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:18,112
Talkin about both shooting

3254
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:21,952
Wings on Sunday

3255
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:22,976
Had their issue

3256
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:25,792
Silence would be aware of that

3257
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:29,120
Gets a lot of his information from

3258
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:31,680
Kind of bent out of shape about it

3259
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:34,496
He doesn't seem nearly as mad about it as I

3260
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:38,080
Obviously he's opposed to them

3261
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:44,480
Not being around

3262
02:38:44,736 --> 02:38:46,016
The story about what happened

3263
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:48,576
Cares a little

3264
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:52,160
It's a weird way to put it he cares so he likes

3265
02:38:52,928 --> 02:38:53,952
That's an accurate weight

3266
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:57,024
True but I think it is true

3267
02:38:59,072 --> 02:38:59,584
That story

3268
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:03,680
Individual supposedly uploaded this Manifesto

3269
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,872
Internet provider

3270
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:14,432
Is beyond dangerous

3271
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:19,040
Talking about taking away URL as well

3272
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:23,648
This individual

3273
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:26,208
To go and do this it's just proposed

3274
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:28,256
Interesting conversation

3275
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:30,048
Preposterous

3276
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:33,632
But situation here they Channel little bit

3277
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:35,936
41 is a real prophet

3278
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:38,496
Getting radicalized on that site

3279
02:39:38,752 --> 02:39:39,520
Consistent pattern

3280
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,848
Beyond that a ton of Alex's fake information

3281
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:44,896
Unfortunate

3282
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:47,968
Soap making it a little bit harder for him to find that Lohan

3283
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:49,504
Fruit

3284
02:39:50,272 --> 02:39:54,112
Play PCS to work for it a little bit more it'll bring out that fighting spirit

3285
02:39:54,368 --> 02:39:56,928
Fright that old

3286
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:57,952
Please inform

3287
02:39:58,208 --> 02:39:59,232
Or he'll quit even

3288
02:40:00,768 --> 02:40:02,816
What happened

3289
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:03,584
Taken down

3290
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:07,680
Where the government to do that I would agree that there probably be a little bit of a bad president

3291
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:09,728
And I don't know how

3292
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:13,312
But I don't think I'd like the

3293
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:15,616
In reality would happen

3294
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:17,664
What's better cloudflare

3295
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:21,248
Security company decided to stop working with h

3296
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:22,784
Leaving them with no protection

3297
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:24,832
Packers and denial-of-service

3298
02:40:25,856 --> 02:40:32,000
Most websites have Security Services they can work with that they do work with

3299
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:34,304
It disrupted all that off

3300
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:36,352
Those websites

3301
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:38,912
So if you're running a WordPress page and the Conte

3302
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:41,728
Does outside what they allow

3303
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:44,288
18 doesn't have really any rules

3304
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:46,080
So in essence their relationship

3305
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:53,248
Claire was becoming cloudflare was just protecting website recently dangerous and illegal things were going on

3306
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:54,272
And no one was doing it

3307
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:55,296
About it

3308
02:40:55,808 --> 02:40:57,088
Cloudflare has no obligation

3309
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:57,856
To protect

3310
02:40:58,624 --> 02:41:00,928
And they decided that they had adopted sever the relationship

3311
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:02,464
That's their right to decide

3312
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:07,584
After the United right rally cloudflare drop their services for being used by the daily Stormer

3313
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,632
This is something I can do and honestly should do

3314
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,192
Is 18 or the daily Stormer existed

3315
02:41:12,448 --> 02:41:14,240
Entirely toxic hate-filled spaces

3316
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:18,848
No company should be forced to work with them to provide services that allow them to maintain their space

3317
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:21,152
As long as there are other companies in that much

3318
02:41:21,408 --> 02:41:23,456
Marketspace

3319
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:27,040
One of the things

3320
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:31,136
Yeah it's just that has nothing to do with him protecting their free speech

3321
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:32,160
Motivate

3322
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:32,928
This is bad

3323
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,696
Yeah yeah

3324
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:38,048
What are the only things that allows these exist in operator

3325
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:39,072
Intense security

3326
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:39,840
Anonymity

3327
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:45,984
It's create a place where users are free to throw out racial slurs cheer on mass shootings plan mass shooting

3328
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,264
Call for genocide

3329
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,800
And whatever other horrible

3330
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:49,568
You can imagine

3331
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,104
A lot of it's probably in

3332
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:52,896
Sincere but the single thing that makes

3333
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:54,432
Is it possible is

3334
02:41:54,944 --> 02:41:57,248
Without a company like cloudflare providing that

3335
02:41:57,504 --> 02:42:00,832
Liberty protection the entire game falls apart

3336
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:03,392
This, could be traced back to me being

3337
02:42:03,648 --> 02:42:05,440
Yeah real races pile of s***

3338
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:08,000
Fright is no it's that's what protects

3339
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:10,304
It's for people who can still feel

3340
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:12,352
In the real world Maybe

3341
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:13,120
Yeah

3342
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:15,168
Pretty soon after cloudflare

3343
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:24,384
But quickly fell apart when it was really just selling services from another company

3344
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,408
Who said f*** that s***

3345
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,176
Pulled their service

3346
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:32,832
It's not coincidence that fit mitigate is also the company that came in to protect the daily Stormer after that were kicked off clouds

3347
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:37,184
I'm going to guess they would say if they protecting free speech thing but I don't buy that shift

3348
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:43,328
Eddie White the situation as it stands now is best as I can tell is that doesn't have solid security

3349
02:42:43,584 --> 02:42:45,376
Is a company that will work for them

3350
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:46,144
And work with them

3351
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:48,704
And that could effectively be the end of their effectiveness

3352
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,728
As a radicalization

3353
02:42:50,752 --> 02:42:51,264
We'll see though

3354
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:57,664
Other some other s*** come along and work with them so the company could agree to do it

3355
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:58,688
Coordinates input this out

3356
02:42:58,944 --> 02:43:01,248
Or a whole new Hub could pop up in short order

3357
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:02,528
For the time being

3358
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:04,064
I think it's ineffective disruption

3359
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:04,832
Turn of the process

3360
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:05,856
Well that doesn't

3361
02:43:06,112 --> 02:43:06,624
Messerli solved

3362
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:07,648
The problem

3363
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:08,928
I think it's probably apposite

3364
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:12,768
That's my field on it is a good first step

3365
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:16,352
There's never it's never a bad idea

3366
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:18,400
A

3367
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:19,936
It's an action

3368
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:21,472
At the very least it's

3369
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:22,240
Talking some

3370
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:24,544
Has nobody else is doing a goddamn thing

3371
02:43:28,384 --> 02:43:28,896
Bad work

3372
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:32,736
Turn Alex's part so far I mean Sunday shows full

3373
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:35,296
A lot of nonsense but so far

3374
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:40,928
You know we seeing Alex misreporting this story we've heard him bread

3375
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:47,328
It's just

3376
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:54,496
Mexico's crime rate

3377
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:56,288
Nonsensical Waze

3378
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:57,568
Rambling in

3379
02:43:57,824 --> 02:44:01,152
Just making stuff up about burglary rates in America

3380
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:02,944
And so it's really funny when he says.

3381
02:44:08,832 --> 02:44:10,112
Michelle

3382
02:44:10,368 --> 02:44:11,648
Sorry just put

3383
02:44:11,904 --> 02:44:13,440
Hundreds of Articles out here

3384
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:22,400
Computers

3385
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:24,704
The train stories

3386
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:28,800
New story show for 25 years 25 years

3387
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:33,408
You switching my couple minutes

3388
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:39,808
So I don't

3389
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:46,208
I've noticed that lately and its present-day episodes

3390
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:50,560
Really I don't know what the deal is

3391
02:44:51,072 --> 02:44:51,840
There's

3392
02:44:52,608 --> 02:44:53,120
Hi

3393
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:55,424
High-level quality problem

3394
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:57,472
It's not your earphones

3395
02:44:57,728 --> 02:44:58,496
It's not us that's

3396
02:44:58,752 --> 02:44:59,264
That's on his own

3397
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:02,080
Yeah it's pretty pretty

3398
02:45:02,592 --> 02:45:06,176
He goes on to ramble about how like people that old radio station

3399
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:08,224
I'm freezing all the printer paper

3400
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:11,040
Play bodies on printer

3401
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:13,088
There's no way that those are not

3402
02:45:13,344 --> 02:45:14,368
Props

3403
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:18,208
Maybe maybe

3404
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:21,536
Maybe too deep on an article

3405
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:26,144
In his next life Alex

3406
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:27,424
Is complaining about Trump

3407
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:32,288
Trumpet been talking about putting

3408
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:37,152
And place where people who are red.

3409
02:45:37,408 --> 02:45:37,920
Gun

3410
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:43,296
At this point he probably you could have told me he was trying to outlaw red flags as a way to help.

3411
02:45:45,088 --> 02:45:45,856
Maybe whatever

3412
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:49,184
So Alex is not into that but he's also not

3413
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,720
Nearly as mad about that is

3414
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:54,304
I thought for sure that tuna this show and he be like

3415
02:45:54,816 --> 02:45:56,096
Nice

3416
02:45:57,632 --> 02:45:58,144
I don't know

3417
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:02,496
Totally fine with that

3418
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:06,335
War

3419
02:46:07,615 --> 02:46:09,663
So Alex is like this is unnecessary

3420
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:12,735
Because there's already this sort of thing

3421
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:14,783
He said I love Satan

3422
02:46:15,039 --> 02:46:19,903
Go to hell

3423
02:46:22,463 --> 02:46:26,815
You don't need some red flag

3424
02:46:28,095 --> 02:46:29,119
Look at that guy

3425
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:31,679
Hail

3426
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:38,591
Use a Baker Act

3427
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:40,895
People try

3428
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:43,199
Target

3429
02:46:43,455 --> 02:46:44,991
Young women who were the targets

3430
02:46:45,503 --> 02:46:47,807
Is harassment in high school try

3431
02:46:50,111 --> 02:46:50,623
I will say

3432
02:46:51,135 --> 02:46:51,903
On paper

3433
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:52,671
Yeah

3434
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:53,951
There are things in place

3435
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:54,975
They can help

3436
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:56,511
Any sort of situation

3437
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:59,071
But the conversation is about

3438
02:46:59,583 --> 02:47:00,095
Work

3439
02:47:00,351 --> 02:47:00,863
And we need to take

3440
02:47:01,119 --> 02:47:04,191
This more seriously and possibly that could be done through further legislation

3441
02:47:04,703 --> 02:47:05,215
Maybe

3442
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:07,263
But anyway

3443
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:09,055
Would you would you believe

3444
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:11,103
But our expenses Wheels awhile

3445
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:13,151
Listen to

3446
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:14,175
Ranting about him

3447
02:47:14,687 --> 02:47:15,199
Sure

3448
02:47:17,503 --> 02:47:21,087
Have that distance stair little spoiled rotten baby

3449
02:47:23,135 --> 02:47:24,927
Probably jerks off 50 times a day

3450
02:47:25,951 --> 02:47:30,303
We know the exact from them

3451
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:31,583
They're creeps

3452
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:37,727
And nobody ever beat his ass

3453
02:47:38,495 --> 02:47:39,007
I hate

3454
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:41,567
Soma

3455
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:43,103
Needed added ass

3456
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:44,127
Royal

3457
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:52,831
Origin story

3458
02:47:57,951 --> 02:47:58,719
People smaller than me

3459
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:04,351
Beat the living hell out of people once I hit puberty

3460
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:07,679
Why are you doing

3461
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:12,287
Like why are you why did you start ranting about the date

3462
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:13,055
Shooter

3463
02:48:16,383 --> 02:48:19,455
He's probably a bully

3464
02:48:20,735 --> 02:48:22,527
Stop making this about yourself

3465
02:48:22,783 --> 02:48:23,295
Everything is

3466
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:25,343
18 cookbooks

3467
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:26,367
It's crazy

3468
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:27,391
So

3469
02:48:27,647 --> 02:48:29,439
This shooter

3470
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:31,743
Also

3471
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:32,511
Show some

3472
02:48:32,767 --> 02:48:33,279
Accessories

3473
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:34,559
To use

3474
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:35,327
During the shooting

3475
02:48:36,095 --> 02:48:37,375
Alex believe

3476
02:48:40,191 --> 02:48:42,239
Copycat

3477
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:44,799
Dresses or ear protection

3478
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:45,823
Everything

3479
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:53,247
Because they're used to wearing the headphones when they play the shoot'em up things he was into that too

3480
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:54,271
Great

3481
02:48:54,783 --> 02:48:55,295
F*** you

3482
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:59,135
We're not we're not talking about videos

3483
02:48:59,391 --> 02:49:00,159
Games

3484
02:49:01,183 --> 02:49:07,327
If you have anybody's like video games then they're done there's no argument for not arguing this argument with saddle

3485
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:08,351
Little ten-year-old

3486
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:13,215
Go back and f****** time and I presented without comment

3487
02:49:13,471 --> 02:49:19,615
That's what Alex

3488
02:49:19,871 --> 02:49:22,943
But I was going to say okay or not

3489
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:27,807
So earlier on Sundays episode Alex brought up the babies in incubators

3490
02:49:28,063 --> 02:49:29,087
Richie blames on the left

3491
02:49:31,135 --> 02:49:34,463
Justification

3492
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:36,511
You get the question thing

3493
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:38,303
And again he's not questioning

3494
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:39,839
Creating misinformation

3495
02:49:40,863 --> 02:49:41,375
Very clear

3496
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:42,911
Brings back up the babies in

3497
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:43,679
Incubators

3498
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:44,447
At this is

3499
02:49:44,959 --> 02:49:45,727
F****** fast

3500
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:50,079
We have arrived

3501
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:53,151
Take the baby

3502
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:54,943
Desert Shield

3503
02:49:56,223 --> 02:49:58,527
Offensive

3504
02:49:59,295 --> 02:50:03,135
And they came and testified that they saw baby brother

3505
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:06,463
The girl

3506
02:50:06,719 --> 02:50:07,743
PR firm

3507
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:09,279
Control by the Sally's

3508
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:18,239
Was Allah

3509
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:19,263
Is Ally

3510
02:50:20,031 --> 02:50:21,823
We talked about the specifics of the baby

3511
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:25,151
Incubators narrative in a past episode so I don't want to go all the way back

3512
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:35,903
1990 testimony that was given about the Iraqi Security Forces stealing from Kuwaiti Hospital

3513
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:37,183
I'm leaving children to die

3514
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:39,743
Pretend that there aren't

3515
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:44,607
However it's awfully simplistic that the testimony was the only reason

3516
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:47,423
George h.w. Bush began the Gulf War

3517
02:50:47,679 --> 02:50:51,007
Hunter was a piece of

3518
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:54,079
It does appear that some of that testimony was not act

3519
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:55,871
All that's fine

3520
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:58,687
Just got the testimony on those terms

3521
02:50:58,943 --> 02:50:59,967
I think you'll be a great use of it

3522
02:51:00,223 --> 02:51:00,735
This time

3523
02:51:00,991 --> 02:51:02,527
That might be something an actual skepta

3524
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:07,135
I do someone likes would prefer to embellish and exaggerate things in order to

3525
02:51:07,391 --> 02:51:10,975
To use that example to help justify his unjustifiable position

3526
02:51:11,231 --> 02:51:14,047
But he deserves to have a knee-jerk reaction to Every Act

3527
02:51:14,303 --> 02:51:16,095
Of white people committing terrorist Acts

3528
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:18,143
Assuming that there's enough

3529
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:21,983
That clip we listen to right there was 31 seconds long

3530
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:25,055
And in italics at 7 completely not true thing

3531
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:26,591
1

3532
02:51:26,847 --> 02:51:31,455
The girls gave the testimony was named to me Aurora Elsa Bob and she had most certainly

3533
02:51:31,711 --> 02:51:32,223
Jessica White

3534
02:51:32,735 --> 02:51:34,527
To her father was not a member of

3535
02:51:34,783 --> 02:51:37,087
PR firm her father was soured out the box

3536
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:39,135
United State

3537
02:51:39,903 --> 02:51:41,439
The pr firm

3538
02:51:41,695 --> 02:51:42,719
When was Hill & Knowlton

3539
02:51:42,975 --> 02:51:45,279
What does working with a group called citizens for a free Kuwait

3540
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:46,815
I can find no evidence

3541
02:51:47,071 --> 02:51:47,839
Support the claim that

3542
02:51:48,095 --> 02:51:48,863
Hill & Knowlton

3543
02:51:49,119 --> 02:51:50,399
Was controlled by the Saudis

3544
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:52,959
For there's no evidence that she was 18

3545
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:53,983
5

3546
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:56,031
No one claimed she was fourteen she was 50

3547
02:51:56,799 --> 02:52:01,407
Stick in her testimony near doesn't specify how many babies were taken out of incubator

3548
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:04,223
But in written testimony later that wasn't under oath

3549
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:05,759
She put the number 815

3550
02:52:06,015 --> 02:52:08,319
Just far lower than Alex's b******* about country

3551
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:09,599
7

3552
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:13,695
Nowhere in her testimony does nearest say that to the babies brains were bashed in

3553
02:52:14,207 --> 02:52:17,279
She just said that they took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold

3554
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:22,655
Staggering amount of details to have wrong in such a short burst of words

3555
02:52:22,911 --> 02:52:24,191
And some of this may sound

3556
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:25,215
But I really need to

3557
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:26,495
Distressed

3558
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:28,287
Kind of has a good point he's wrong

3559
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:30,079
A pathological for him

3560
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:33,151
Even when the circumstances of something are in his wheelhouse

3561
02:52:33,407 --> 02:52:34,943
Story should be a slam dunk

3562
02:52:35,199 --> 02:52:38,527
He can't resist the urge to lie about it and make it even more sensation

3563
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:42,367
Part of that is just that Alex doesn't know much about the stories he

3564
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:43,647
He's telling that's a big part of it

3565
02:52:44,159 --> 02:52:44,671
But another thing

3566
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:46,975
He's like a Jesus Lizard

3567
02:52:47,487 --> 02:52:50,815
He's only able to stay above water and Skip from spot to spot on the surface

3568
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:51,839
Because he has no

3569
02:52:52,607 --> 02:52:53,375
The depth of the water

3570
02:52:53,887 --> 02:52:57,471
If the Jesus Lizard made any use of anything other than the surface of the lake

3571
02:52:57,727 --> 02:52:58,239
It would sink

3572
02:52:58,751 --> 02:52:59,775
And the same is true of Alec

3573
02:53:00,543 --> 02:53:02,335
Both make a great impressive spectacle

3574
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:03,103
But there's not much

3575
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:06,175
I did so much more of the water that they're messing

3576
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:10,783
And as I read that was high when I look at

3577
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:17,695
No I was feeling it

3578
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:21,279
Morning

3579
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:27,423
I have fudge I get the analogy

3580
02:53:29,727 --> 02:53:30,495
It's

3581
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:31,263
It works

3582
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:34,591
He doesn't know anything about this

3583
02:53:34,847 --> 02:53:37,663
The case or if he does he's intentionally exaggerating and

3584
02:53:37,919 --> 02:53:39,455
Misleading things because it helps him make

3585
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:41,503
He's claimed that it's more just

3586
02:53:41,759 --> 02:53:42,271
Certified for him

3587
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:43,807
To quote unquote question

3588
02:53:45,855 --> 02:53:46,367
Flimsy

3589
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:48,159
So

3590
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:49,183
NSX

3591
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:51,231
Alex

3592
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:52,511
Man

3593
02:53:53,023 --> 02:53:54,047
He is all over the place

3594
02:53:57,631 --> 02:53:58,399
I like this go.

3595
02:53:58,911 --> 02:54:01,215
Hollywood movies

3596
02:54:01,983 --> 02:54:04,543
Bill Clinton movie so much

3597
02:54:04,799 --> 02:54:05,823
But Dustin Hoffman

3598
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:07,871
Willie Nelson

3599
02:54:08,895 --> 02:54:10,175
Point of order that's not the belt

3600
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:14,015
Dustin Hoffman Robert De Niro

3601
02:54:14,271 --> 02:54:17,087
Right maybe Denis Leary third

3602
02:54:17,599 --> 02:54:18,111
Iowa

3603
02:54:20,415 --> 02:54:20,927
Yeah

3604
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:21,951
Who's who

3605
02:54:22,207 --> 02:54:23,231
Who's the lady Amanda Hayes

3606
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:28,607
Top billing over f****** Willie Nelson get out of here just cuz you know him

3607
02:54:35,263 --> 02:54:36,287
Exactly that

3608
02:54:36,543 --> 02:54:38,335
Real-time in the same area

3609
02:54:39,103 --> 02:54:44,479
So if you're missing if you miss like arguing that Bill Clinton love dogs so much

3610
02:54:44,735 --> 02:54:45,503
He decided to do it

3611
02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:50,623
6 movie

3612
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:52,927
Long long time

3613
02:54:53,183 --> 02:54:58,303
I'll be the first to admit there's a lot of similarities between situation and some of the details of the

3614
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:00,095
There's also a bunch of different

3615
02:55:00,351 --> 02:55:02,655
Need to wrestle with you want to make this kind of argued

3616
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:05,727
The first is the in the movie the war is fake

3617
02:55:06,239 --> 02:55:07,519
They don't bomb

3618
02:55:09,055 --> 02:55:14,431
If Alex is arguing that the Clinton I couldn't fake bombings because you love Wag the Dog so much even though he

3619
02:55:14,943 --> 02:55:18,527
You would have to know the people would say hey are you wagging the dog right now

3620
02:55:18,783 --> 02:55:20,575
Like legitimately Clinton Secretary of

3621
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:23,391
Defense was asked about Wag the Dog under oath

3622
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:26,463
Movie in 97

3623
02:55:26,719 --> 02:55:28,767
It's not like Clinton would see that movie in the be like

3624
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:31,839
We're going to do exactly this and no one will ever put the pieces together

3625
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:33,375
I would argue that the fact

3626
02:55:33,631 --> 02:55:35,679
There were many surface-level similarities makes it

3627
02:55:35,935 --> 02:55:36,703
Life likely

3628
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:37,983
That the bombings were an attempt

3629
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:39,263
To change the media coverage

3630
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:45,663
There was a cool movie that's what you're doing

3631
02:55:45,919 --> 02:55:46,687
The ridiculous

3632
02:55:48,735 --> 02:55:52,831
The bombing at the military carried out around the time of the Winski Monica Lewinsky

3633
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:55,903
He testified in front of grand jury

3634
02:55:56,415 --> 02:55:57,695
Why do dogs eat

3635
02:55:57,951 --> 02:56:01,279
Put on a steak war in Albania because they know that no one knows any

3636
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:05,119
Alex says the Clinton carried out an attack in

3637
02:56:05,375 --> 02:56:06,143
In the same area

3638
02:56:06,655 --> 02:56:07,935
I should tell you that albanians

3639
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:08,959
Sudan or not

3640
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:13,567
In the same area Thousand Miles give or take

3641
02:56:13,823 --> 02:56:19,967
How to spell Mediterranean

3642
02:56:20,991 --> 02:56:21,503
In the Sahara Desert

3643
02:56:22,015 --> 02:56:23,039
Not very similar or

3644
02:56:23,807 --> 02:56:25,599
As Alex gets in his Studio

3645
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:26,879
Doing his show

3646
02:56:27,135 --> 02:56:28,671
He's closer to Nicaragua

3647
02:56:28,927 --> 02:56:29,951
He's closer to Haiti

3648
02:56:32,511 --> 02:56:36,095
His studio is in the same area is Nicaragua

3649
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:45,311
Nonsensical

3650
02:56:49,151 --> 02:56:50,175
God

3651
02:56:50,431 --> 02:56:50,943
Love it

3652
02:56:51,967 --> 02:56:57,343
You have to take those moments because everything else sucks so much

3653
02:56:58,367 --> 02:56:58,879
Unfiltered love

3654
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:01,695
So in this next clip

3655
02:57:01,951 --> 02:57:02,975
He plays a reporter

3656
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:03,743
From the weekend

3657
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:10,143
This is Monday show but he's playing a clip from the weekend

3658
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:13,215
And keep in mind from his own yes

3659
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:13,983
Yes

3660
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:14,751
Okay

3661
02:57:26,527 --> 02:57:27,295
Christian

3662
02:57:49,567 --> 02:57:54,943
USA

3663
02:58:40,511 --> 02:58:46,143
As much of that is because I want to make this abundantly f******

3664
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:46,911
Clear

3665
02:58:47,167 --> 02:58:49,471
Alex's pretending that he's questioning

3666
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:52,287
That's why the media is afraid of him exist

3667
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:54,079
That is not questioning things

3668
02:58:54,335 --> 02:58:55,359
That is a narrative

3669
02:58:55,615 --> 02:58:56,639
He hasn't narrative

3670
02:58:56,895 --> 02:58:58,175
The Weeknd

3671
02:58:58,943 --> 02:59:04,063
That isn't on Mondays reaction is a form narrative

3672
02:59:04,831 --> 02:59:06,367
Hip has people to blame

3673
02:59:06,623 --> 02:59:07,391
Villain

3674
02:59:07,647 --> 02:59:09,695
It has a storyline and has a reason

3675
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:12,767
It has a victim false narrative about this

3676
02:59:13,023 --> 02:59:15,839
El Paso

3677
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:17,631
This is what he does

3678
02:59:17,887 --> 02:59:19,935
This is not questioning thing

3679
02:59:20,447 --> 02:59:22,239
This is business information

3680
02:59:22,495 --> 02:59:23,775
And propaganda

3681
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:24,543
It's not

3682
02:59:25,567 --> 02:59:26,847
It's not good propaganda

3683
02:59:28,127 --> 02:59:33,247
Evil propaganda

3684
02:59:34,015 --> 02:59:35,039
It's bad

3685
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:40,671
So

3686
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:42,207
You know we got

3687
02:59:44,255 --> 02:59:45,279
Safari

3688
02:59:46,047 --> 02:59:46,559
Yes

3689
02:59:46,815 --> 02:59:48,095
Papr

3690
02:59:48,351 --> 02:59:50,911
We have that one guy who called in and he had Nano Mafia

3691
02:59:55,775 --> 03:00:00,127
And now we get to get four more familiar with just as much of a s******* as Tom pepper

3692
03:00:00,639 --> 03:00:01,151
And that is

3693
03:00:01,407 --> 03:00:02,431
Health Ranger

3694
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:03,199
No

3695
03:00:03,455 --> 03:00:04,735
He's not allowed

3696
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:08,831
This is this is one of Mike Adams theories

3697
03:00:09,087 --> 03:00:09,599
But he has

3698
03:00:09,855 --> 03:00:10,879
It's going about this

3699
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:12,671
A man I want to say this

3700
03:00:12,927 --> 03:00:13,695
Before we started

3701
03:00:13,951 --> 03:00:15,487
Conversate after restart

3702
03:00:15,999 --> 03:00:17,279
This dude is f****** stupid

3703
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:21,887
People were really shot and killed none of us are saying that that didn't happen

3704
03:00:22,143 --> 03:00:24,191
Question is

3705
03:00:24,703 --> 03:00:25,215
What

3706
03:00:28,543 --> 03:00:29,055
Person

3707
03:00:29,311 --> 03:00:30,591
A dispatched

3708
03:00:30,847 --> 03:00:34,943
To this Walmart in El Paso to carry out this shooting

3709
03:00:35,199 --> 03:00:38,015
Suicide mission

3710
03:00:38,271 --> 03:00:39,295
Hearing protection

3711
03:00:39,551 --> 03:00:43,135
What was he wearing ipro Ender Pro as we say in the shooting community

3712
03:00:43,391 --> 03:00:45,695
You only do that if you expect to survive

3713
03:00:46,207 --> 03:00:52,095
Which is why I don't believe that his so-called manifest it was real at all

3714
03:00:52,863 --> 03:00:54,399
You think you're going to a drill

3715
03:01:01,567 --> 03:01:04,127
In the process.

3716
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:06,943
A few hours later

3717
03:01:08,735 --> 03:01:10,271
Galaxy watch

3718
03:01:18,207 --> 03:01:19,231
And I want to see this

3719
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:19,999
He's a complete

3720
03:01:20,255 --> 03:01:20,767
Uber

3721
03:01:21,023 --> 03:01:22,047
Listen to this dumb f***

3722
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:24,351
This is

3723
03:01:25,375 --> 03:01:27,167
These dudes present themselves as gunxperts

3724
03:01:27,423 --> 03:01:32,543
Compassionate about the gun world

3725
03:01:32,799 --> 03:01:33,567
Is this a expect

3726
03:01:33,823 --> 03:01:34,335
Get to survive

3727
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:37,919
Yeah it definitely not cuz you would want to continue to be able to

3728
03:01:38,175 --> 03:01:38,687
Lucianne

3729
03:01:38,943 --> 03:01:43,551
That's part of it

3730
03:01:43,807 --> 03:01:46,111
Just off the top of my head I can come up with a bunch of reasons

3731
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:49,951
By someone who expected I would still wear ear and eye protection

3732
03:01:50,719 --> 03:01:53,535
How about

3733
03:01:53,791 --> 03:01:59,935
Is it outside the realm of possibility that these are people who shot regular

3734
03:02:00,191 --> 03:02:02,239
Is that seriously not even a possibility

3735
03:02:02,751 --> 03:02:03,263
What do I comfort

3736
03:02:03,775 --> 03:02:08,639
Even if you expect to die that doesn't mean you want to risk blowing out your eardrums right before you do

3737
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:12,735
Or how about the notion that these dudes knew that they would be more effective carrying out a shooting

3738
03:02:12,991 --> 03:02:14,783
With ear and eye protection

3739
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:22,207
Kind of like kind of a kickback or powder or whatever gets into your eyes big shooting that's going to limit your efficacy

3740
03:02:22,719 --> 03:02:23,487
As well ringing

3741
03:02:23,999 --> 03:02:30,143
Your ears it's entirely possible that these guys just saw using ear and eye protection is being part of maximizing the damage they'd be able to

3742
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:31,423
Because

3743
03:02:31,679 --> 03:02:33,727
Yeah they'll be protected from the little things

3744
03:02:33,983 --> 03:02:35,263
Could derail their shooting

3745
03:02:35,519 --> 03:02:36,031
Maturely

3746
03:02:36,287 --> 03:02:40,383
Absolutely for Mike Adams argue with a straight face that use an eye ear protection semi proof

3747
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:43,967
The El Paso shooter expected to live is a gigantic

3748
03:02:44,735 --> 03:02:46,015
He hasn't proven his promises

3749
03:02:46,527 --> 03:02:47,807
Baby aspirin does conclude

3750
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:49,087
He's just talking s***

3751
03:02:49,343 --> 03:02:50,623
I need those he's talkin

3752
03:02:51,391 --> 03:02:53,439
The reason the possible other reason

3753
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:55,999
They might wear protection art discuss

3754
03:02:56,255 --> 03:02:57,535
Because Mike and Alex have a specific

3755
03:02:57,791 --> 03:02:58,303
Conclusion

3756
03:02:58,559 --> 03:02:59,071
Need to get to

3757
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:00,351
The misinformation

3758
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:02,143
It's towards a desired goal

3759
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:03,423
Not to some kind of

3760
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:04,447
Skeptical analysis

3761
03:03:05,983 --> 03:03:06,495
That's

3762
03:03:06,751 --> 03:03:07,263
Just a bun

3763
03:03:07,519 --> 03:03:08,031
Italy clear

3764
03:03:09,055 --> 03:03:13,151
So now they're presenting the idea that you have these guys who were like brainwash

3765
03:03:13,663 --> 03:03:14,175
Or something

3766
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:17,247
Like the globalist have despatched

3767
03:03:18,783 --> 03:03:19,807
Operating

3768
03:03:20,319 --> 03:03:20,831
Function

3769
03:03:22,111 --> 03:03:23,647
And I was kind of being rushed out

3770
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:26,207
To break but he he he

3771
03:03:26,463 --> 03:03:26,975
Makes referee

3772
03:03:27,231 --> 03:03:28,767
Something that has to do with it

3773
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:32,351
The technique in the system that they the globalist use

3774
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:34,143
Peaks my interest

3775
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:35,423
Because I hadn't heard of mention

3776
03:03:39,007 --> 03:03:42,847
On the other side Arlington Road system

3777
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:47,711
He's about to break something real I never heard this

3778
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:48,735
Discussed before

3779
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:51,807
Kind of disappointed me because when you came back

3780
03:03:52,063 --> 03:03:53,599
From the commercial break

3781
03:03:54,111 --> 03:03:54,623
Explained it

3782
03:03:54,879 --> 03:03:55,647
Here's what it's all about

3783
03:03:59,743 --> 03:04:03,071
All the movies on Netflix

3784
03:04:03,327 --> 03:04:04,607
4

3785
03:04:05,631 --> 03:04:11,519
That's terrible

3786
03:04:15,103 --> 03:04:18,175
Flights

3787
03:04:18,431 --> 03:04:20,735
Talk about

3788
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:24,575
Again Arlington Road came out

3789
03:04:24,831 --> 03:04:25,855
15 years ago

3790
03:04:26,111 --> 03:04:26,879
Jeff Bridges

3791
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:31,743
Okay

3792
03:04:31,999 --> 03:04:32,511
Here we go

3793
03:04:33,023 --> 03:04:35,327
And there's this weird shadowy right-wing group

3794
03:04:38,399 --> 03:04:41,727
Nope

3795
03:04:54,015 --> 03:04:55,807
Minutes

3796
03:04:56,063 --> 03:05:02,207
Of the end of Arlington Road movie

3797
03:05:02,463 --> 03:05:08,607
Arlington Road

3798
03:05:08,863 --> 03:05:12,959
Conservative

3799
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:14,495
Euharlee Road

3800
03:05:15,263 --> 03:05:17,055
System

3801
03:05:17,311 --> 03:05:18,079
You got tricked

3802
03:05:18,335 --> 03:05:23,967
The same way I just I thought it sounded like maybe it's something

3803
03:05:24,223 --> 03:05:24,735
Goddamn

3804
03:05:24,991 --> 03:05:27,551
About the movie Garland

3805
03:05:27,807 --> 03:05:33,439
Winton Road Bridges character is not setup for a terrorist attack by the FBI or the Deep state

3806
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:36,767
But his neighbors are going to do it

3807
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:39,583
We're looking for someone to carry out the attack

3808
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:42,399
In such a way as to make it look like it's a lone wolf attack

3809
03:05:42,655 --> 03:05:45,471
To protect their terrorist cell so they can continue operation

3810
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:48,031
Again we run into this thing we're out

3811
03:05:48,287 --> 03:05:50,847
Can't offend any of those ideas except by reference in movies

3812
03:05:51,103 --> 03:05:52,383
It's still on for the movies

3813
03:05:53,407 --> 03:05:53,919
Take the points

3814
03:05:54,687 --> 03:05:55,455
Especially

3815
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:57,247
The book that one

3816
03:05:57,759 --> 03:05:58,783
That's when we get into

3817
03:05:59,039 --> 03:05:59,551
The real trouble

3818
03:06:00,575 --> 03:06:01,087
Crazy

3819
03:06:01,855 --> 03:06:03,647
Minutes

3820
03:06:03,903 --> 03:06:05,951
Of this and at the end of the movie

3821
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:06,719
It's weird

3822
03:06:07,743 --> 03:06:08,255
It is

3823
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:09,535
Is he eating lunch again

3824
03:06:09,791 --> 03:06:14,143
I think it might be a couple times I think it's

3825
03:06:14,399 --> 03:06:14,911
Pretty funny

3826
03:06:23,359 --> 03:06:29,503
Movie and mostly scripts are written by the CIA

3827
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:35,903
Operate through that but I couldn't possibly

3828
03:06:40,511 --> 03:06:43,071
Three Transformers movies antonucci

3829
03:06:43,583 --> 03:06:45,631
I can find no evidence that he is CIA

3830
03:06:46,143 --> 03:06:51,007
Also Arlington Road is not a good movie it's a paranoid convoluted mess of movie with tons

3831
03:06:55,359 --> 03:06:58,175
I've site long time ago

3832
03:07:02,271 --> 03:07:05,087
Refresh my memory

3833
03:07:05,599 --> 03:07:06,367
Universal

3834
03:07:07,647 --> 03:07:08,927
So

3835
03:07:10,975 --> 03:07:16,863
Metacritic just gives it a rating of Alex Jones

3836
03:07:17,119 --> 03:07:18,655
A bunch of the movie

3837
03:07:18,911 --> 03:07:20,447
I think he starts realizing

3838
03:07:21,727 --> 03:07:22,239
Supposed to be

3839
03:07:23,263 --> 03:07:23,775
Yeah

3840
03:07:31,199 --> 03:07:31,711
Hypocrite

3841
03:07:31,967 --> 03:07:33,503
Not good for radio

3842
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:36,319
Yeah

3843
03:07:36,575 --> 03:07:38,879
So here is

3844
03:07:39,135 --> 03:07:39,647
Peace about

3845
03:07:39,903 --> 03:07:40,415
Eaton Road

3846
03:07:41,951 --> 03:07:46,303
You can see like a real problem but it's so in line with his brain

3847
03:07:56,031 --> 03:07:58,079
So the end of the movie involves

3848
03:07:58,335 --> 03:08:00,639
Jeff Bridges being setup for

3849
03:08:00,895 --> 03:08:01,407
A bombing

3850
03:08:01,919 --> 03:08:06,271
What you saw there was the explosion at the FBI building

3851
03:08:07,039 --> 03:08:07,551
Right

3852
03:08:07,807 --> 03:08:10,879
Alex is missing a vital point in the plot of this movie

3853
03:08:11,135 --> 03:08:14,975
And that is at the bombing of that FBI building was still definitely a terrorist

3854
03:08:15,999 --> 03:08:22,143
Just because Jeff Bridges got setup that doesn't mean that it wasn't still an organized coordinated attack by an anti-government Terror

3855
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:23,167
Cell

3856
03:08:23,423 --> 03:08:27,263
It's unfortunate that Jeff Bridges good name has to be tarnished by the bombing

3857
03:08:29,311 --> 03:08:34,175
But whether it's

3858
03:08:34,431 --> 03:08:37,247
Either way it's about a right-wing

3859
03:08:37,503 --> 03:08:41,343
It's remarkable how Alex rewrites both reality and picture

3860
03:08:41,855 --> 03:08:42,367
If it is Worlds

3861
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:45,695
In the movie Tim Robbins and his wife

3862
03:08:46,207 --> 03:08:51,839
But I was watching this movie and besides they must actually be working for the globalist and back the writers real point

3863
03:08:52,351 --> 03:08:55,167
I know that already subjective and we all bring a lot of real baggage

3864
03:08:55,423 --> 03:08:56,447
Steady BT we consume

3865
03:08:56,959 --> 03:09:00,543
But I'm very unsettled by the way Alex

3866
03:09:00,799 --> 03:09:01,311
That much

3867
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:04,383
I-10

3868
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:09,247
That much bag I think it's worth a try and describe the plot to the writer he be like wow

3869
03:09:09,503 --> 03:09:15,391
Yeah I did not say that was that was my point even want to know how Alex understands I

3870
03:09:15,647 --> 03:09:16,159
F******

3871
03:09:16,671 --> 03:09:17,695
Wheel of Fortune

3872
03:09:17,951 --> 03:09:18,463
Episode

3873
03:09:18,719 --> 03:09:23,071
Like I don't want it.

3874
03:09:24,095 --> 03:09:27,167
So the whole time he's playing Arlington Road Mike Adams is on

3875
03:09:27,423 --> 03:09:27,935
Good

3876
03:09:29,727 --> 03:09:32,799
Whatever as long as you're on hold your not hurting somebody else

3877
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:37,663
So I started things off with a Pioneer Press

3878
03:09:43,295 --> 03:09:45,855
If you are moving with a long gun

3879
03:09:46,111 --> 03:09:50,207
Sunday are on AK you're moving and trying to shoot targets they're running

3880
03:09:50,463 --> 03:09:51,999
It is extremely difficult

3881
03:09:52,255 --> 03:09:54,303
An expert Marksman

3882
03:09:54,559 --> 03:09:57,119
To pull that off that's not something

3883
03:09:57,375 --> 03:10:00,703
21 year old with no experience

3884
03:10:01,471 --> 03:10:03,519
So

3885
03:10:03,775 --> 03:10:05,055
Some softball today

3886
03:10:05,311 --> 03:10:07,359
Absolutely nonsensical on

3887
03:10:07,615 --> 03:10:09,407
What's face

3888
03:10:09,663 --> 03:10:10,687
And that is the DC shooter

3889
03:10:11,455 --> 03:10:11,967
Targets

3890
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:16,063
They weren't going into places like where they committed their crimes with the intention of shooting

3891
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:18,623
Specific people

3892
03:10:18,879 --> 03:10:20,927
And if that were the case b Mike might have Addie's

3893
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:21,951
Oh yeah yeah

3894
03:10:22,207 --> 03:10:26,815
Open fire people

3895
03:10:27,071 --> 03:10:29,631
If that's not quite as hard to pull off when you're moving

3896
03:10:29,887 --> 03:10:30,911
If you are aiming at something

3897
03:10:31,167 --> 03:10:31,679
Specific

3898
03:10:33,215 --> 03:10:36,799
To pretend that bike doesn't understand that it's so far beyond the realm of possibility

3899
03:10:37,567 --> 03:10:39,615
He absolutely knows this s*** getting pretend

3900
03:10:39,871 --> 03:10:40,895
That he doesn't

3901
03:10:41,151 --> 03:10:41,919
Can spend these f*****-up

3902
03:10:42,175 --> 03:10:42,943
Conspiracy narrative

3903
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:43,967
Protect his precious gun

3904
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:46,783
Against this isn't questioning world event

3905
03:10:47,039 --> 03:10:48,319
Intentionally missing

3906
03:10:48,575 --> 03:10:49,087
Informing people

3907
03:10:49,343 --> 03:10:50,367
The bill propaganda

3908
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:52,671
This is the business that Infowars is in

3909
03:10:53,183 --> 03:10:55,231
Well that and movie reviews

3910
03:10:56,767 --> 03:10:57,279
That's the other business

3911
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:01,119
Say they were doin too much

3912
03:11:01,631 --> 03:11:02,143
Reviewing

3913
03:11:02,399 --> 03:11:03,167
So much as like

3914
03:11:03,679 --> 03:11:08,287
Well I mean I guess

3915
03:11:08,543 --> 03:11:09,567
So

3916
03:11:10,079 --> 03:11:13,151
They are in the business of movie reviews you're right you're right

3917
03:11:13,407 --> 03:11:13,919
Yeah

3918
03:11:18,271 --> 03:11:18,783
When was fake

3919
03:11:19,039 --> 03:11:20,831
For a weird reason

3920
03:11:21,343 --> 03:11:22,111
He is a very strange

3921
03:11:23,391 --> 03:11:29,535
This whole situation is you just shot 20 times

3922
03:11:41,311 --> 03:11:47,455
I think it's really f***** up for a thing for Alex abusing the absence of police brutality to be a standard by which he judges

3923
03:11:47,967 --> 03:11:48,479
Was real or not

3924
03:11:48,991 --> 03:11:51,039
When does countless examples of shootings are people are taking

3925
03:11:54,623 --> 03:11:58,975
Dylann roof and James Holmes both come to my

3926
03:11:59,487 --> 03:12:00,511
I don't know.

3927
03:12:00,767 --> 03:12:04,863
I would never take it into their own hands just to rough people up for no reason

3928
03:12:05,119 --> 03:12:06,655
Even if they have just committed a crime

3929
03:12:07,167 --> 03:12:12,031
That seems like exactly the kind of his entire career on

3930
03:12:12,543 --> 03:12:13,055
Given that

3931
03:12:13,311 --> 03:12:14,335
It seemed so weird

3932
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:15,359
Legitimately

3933
03:12:15,615 --> 03:12:16,895
Suggest that the El Paso shooter was

3934
03:12:17,151 --> 03:12:18,943
Probably not the real shooter because cops

3935
03:12:19,455 --> 03:12:19,967
Beat them up

3936
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:21,759
Implying that the normal things

3937
03:12:22,015 --> 03:12:23,295
For cops to do

3938
03:12:25,343 --> 03:12:26,367
Sick mind this guy

3939
03:12:26,879 --> 03:12:30,207
Yeah I mean on the other hand the normal things are comes to do kind of seem

3940
03:12:30,463 --> 03:12:31,487
Seems to be beat people up

3941
03:12:32,255 --> 03:12:32,767
So

3942
03:12:33,023 --> 03:12:33,535
I get

3943
03:12:34,815 --> 03:12:37,375
Breakup process because cops are

3944
03:12:47,359 --> 03:12:49,151
I guess that means

3945
03:12:49,407 --> 03:12:51,967
This guy wasn't the real shooter or something

3946
03:12:52,479 --> 03:12:54,783
But now Alex argues that there were a bunch of shooter

3947
03:12:55,551 --> 03:12:56,575
Which is something that he is

3948
03:12:56,831 --> 03:12:57,855
Got to going off of

3949
03:12:58,367 --> 03:12:59,647
You know there were first

3950
03:12:59,903 --> 03:13:03,231
Accounts people who were saying there were

3951
03:13:03,743 --> 03:13:07,071
Not necessarily

3952
03:13:07,327 --> 03:13:08,351
Indicative of

3953
03:13:08,863 --> 03:13:11,167
Total truth I saw that I saw that

3954
03:13:11,423 --> 03:13:14,239
In the in the immediate aftermath of like it's

3955
03:13:14,495 --> 03:13:16,031
Possible that there may have been

3956
03:13:16,287 --> 03:13:17,567
And and it's like

3957
03:13:17,823 --> 03:13:23,711
Okay everybody is saying it's a possible and there's a high likelihood that will will get when we get more information

3958
03:13:24,223 --> 03:13:30,367
It would be but nobody knows of a f******

3959
03:13:30,623 --> 03:13:31,391
Tragedy like this

3960
03:13:31,903 --> 03:13:32,927
So much information

3961
03:13:33,183 --> 03:13:39,327
Is flying around wires crossed for anybody to have been like

3962
03:13:39,583 --> 03:13:43,167
There are multiple Shooters there are people who

3963
03:13:43,423 --> 03:13:46,751
Are there on the screen

3964
03:13:47,007 --> 03:13:47,519
Might have

3965
03:13:47,775 --> 03:13:50,591
I can be caused by

3966
03:13:50,847 --> 03:13:52,127
Echoing gunshot

3967
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:53,407
Robin Wright

3968
03:13:53,663 --> 03:13:54,431
From different directions

3969
03:13:55,199 --> 03:13:57,759
And so I don't really care too much about those

3970
03:14:00,575 --> 03:14:02,879
It seems pointless to engage with

3971
03:14:03,647 --> 03:14:05,183
But Alex has another reason

3972
03:14:13,631 --> 03:14:16,191
She says according to my sources in El Paso

3973
03:14:20,543 --> 03:14:24,383
Walmart shooting

3974
03:14:27,455 --> 03:14:30,527
Otherwise

3975
03:14:32,063 --> 03:14:33,087
That's a real

3976
03:14:35,647 --> 03:14:37,183
Create outside at law enforcement

3977
03:14:40,255 --> 03:14:40,767
But

3978
03:14:42,303 --> 03:14:43,583
We are here on Monday

3979
03:14:43,839 --> 03:14:45,887
She peed it out clarification based on an update

3980
03:14:46,911 --> 03:14:48,703
It turned out the police had detained a second

3981
03:14:48,959 --> 03:14:50,495
Person who is armed

3982
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:52,031
But they released him

3983
03:14:52,543 --> 03:14:54,847
It was a case of somebody passing along bad information

3984
03:14:55,103 --> 03:14:56,895
Based on the chaos that was unfolding

3985
03:14:57,919 --> 03:15:00,223
This is the sort of thing that happens during every crisis

3986
03:15:00,479 --> 03:15:06,623
Some tragedy to work for legitimate uncredible

3987
03:15:07,647 --> 03:15:08,415
Confirmed reports

3988
03:15:08,927 --> 03:15:10,463
When they do so it makes it easier for

3989
03:15:10,719 --> 03:15:11,231
Conspiracy theorist

3990
03:15:11,487 --> 03:15:14,303
So we've The credibility of their Outlet into the later

3991
03:15:14,559 --> 03:15:15,327
Conspiracies as we see

3992
03:15:17,119 --> 03:15:18,655
Reporting in reports

3993
03:15:21,215 --> 03:15:22,751
Reports of people who think that there were multiple

3994
03:15:23,007 --> 03:15:23,775
Bull shooters

3995
03:15:24,031 --> 03:15:24,799
Are not evidence

3996
03:15:26,591 --> 03:15:28,895
These reports are all investigated it's just

3997
03:15:29,151 --> 03:15:31,455
That in the immediate aftermath of an event like this

3998
03:15:31,711 --> 03:15:32,991
It's easy for misinformation aging

3999
03:15:34,015 --> 03:15:35,295
Any slip-up

4000
03:15:35,551 --> 03:15:36,319
How to build

4001
03:15:36,575 --> 03:15:38,111
Make it look like there's something

4002
03:15:38,367 --> 03:15:38,879
What's going on

4003
03:15:39,391 --> 03:15:40,415
In the past I've liked him.

4004
03:15:40,671 --> 03:15:41,183
Concrete bits

4005
03:15:41,439 --> 03:15:41,951
Not yet dry

4006
03:15:42,463 --> 03:15:45,535
India media. Right after an event like this Alex and Izzie

4007
03:15:45,791 --> 03:15:48,351
Can easily imprint their suspicions of narratives on to the story

4008
03:15:48,607 --> 03:15:49,887
The once the cement dries

4009
03:15:50,143 --> 03:15:51,935
Once the actual information starts to come out

4010
03:15:52,191 --> 03:15:53,471
That becomes a whole lot harder

4011
03:15:53,983 --> 03:15:57,055
That's why Alex made his video on Saturday on his day off about

4012
03:15:57,823 --> 03:15:58,591
Immediacy

4013
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:01,151
Another big reason that he desperately needs to

4014
03:16:01,407 --> 03:16:02,431
To get back on social media

4015
03:16:02,943 --> 03:16:03,455
Davis Wade

4016
03:16:04,991 --> 03:16:06,527
Dad said if he was like a

4017
03:16:06,783 --> 03:16:07,295
The Jesus Lizard

4018
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:09,343
Running across

4019
03:16:11,391 --> 03:16:15,743
Fair enough

4020
03:16:15,999 --> 03:16:16,511
You knew it

4021
03:16:16,767 --> 03:16:18,815
So Alex thinks everything's fake

4022
03:16:19,327 --> 03:16:20,607
And who's all set up

4023
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:22,655
Good morning

4024
03:16:23,167 --> 03:16:24,703
He tries to argue that here is to bring a

4025
03:16:24,959 --> 03:16:26,239
David Hogg

4026
03:16:26,495 --> 03:16:27,007
One of the guys from

4027
03:16:27,263 --> 03:16:27,775
Parkland shooter

4028
03:16:29,567 --> 03:16:30,335
Particularly offensive

4029
03:16:30,847 --> 03:16:31,615
He's talking with

4030
03:16:31,871 --> 03:16:32,383
Mike Adams

4031
03:16:32,639 --> 03:16:34,175
The guy who made

4032
03:16:38,271 --> 03:16:40,063
Targeted harassment of a child

4033
03:16:40,831 --> 03:16:41,343
Whatever

4034
03:16:42,623 --> 03:16:43,391
Here's it out

4035
03:16:46,975 --> 03:16:52,607
When the shooting happened and got there after videos

4036
03:16:55,423 --> 03:17:01,055
This is based on

4037
03:17:01,567 --> 03:17:05,407
By the right-wing of the video where are David Hogg said after school

4038
03:17:05,663 --> 03:17:06,687
He came back to the

4039
03:17:06,943 --> 03:17:07,967
The school to shoot stuff

4040
03:17:08,479 --> 03:17:11,295
He was in the school

4041
03:17:11,551 --> 03:17:12,575
And then came back

4042
03:17:13,343 --> 03:17:15,647
It's very simple but because he says that he

4043
03:17:15,903 --> 03:17:19,231
And I would last and went back to the school and eclipse

4044
03:17:19,743 --> 03:17:22,559
They're able to create the appearance that his story isn't

4045
03:17:22,815 --> 03:17:23,327
Inconsistent

4046
03:17:23,839 --> 03:17:26,655
Is b******* it's been explained over and over again

4047
03:17:26,911 --> 03:17:27,679
Continues to use it

4048
03:17:27,935 --> 03:17:29,727
As some sort of way back

4049
03:17:31,775 --> 03:17:32,543
No you'll just

4050
03:17:33,311 --> 03:17:34,079
You're just good one

4051
03:17:34,335 --> 03:17:36,895
Yeah it's pretty clear that our current strategy

4052
03:17:38,175 --> 03:17:39,455
I suppose dealing with this stuff

4053
03:17:40,223 --> 03:17:40,735
Counter it

4054
03:17:42,271 --> 03:17:43,807
With either

4055
03:17:44,063 --> 03:17:44,575
Listen to oar

4056
03:17:46,879 --> 03:17:48,415
Misinformation

4057
03:17:48,927 --> 03:17:49,951
Is in

4058
03:17:50,463 --> 03:17:54,303
Just not doing the job because he's still allowed to say this

4059
03:17:55,071 --> 03:17:58,143
Yeah yeah something needs to stop at the route

4060
03:17:58,399 --> 03:18:00,191
Before we ever even get to lie

4061
03:18:01,983 --> 03:18:03,263
Here's what here's Snopes

4062
03:18:04,031 --> 03:18:05,311
We need we need Snopes

4063
03:18:05,567 --> 03:18:06,591
You know

4064
03:18:06,847 --> 03:18:09,407
I think they're just probably be civil consequences

4065
03:18:09,663 --> 03:18:12,991
Yeah they're really got it I don't I don't

4066
03:18:13,247 --> 03:18:14,015
From the government

4067
03:18:14,271 --> 03:18:15,039
Just think that people

4068
03:18:15,295 --> 03:18:17,343
I honestly think

4069
03:18:17,855 --> 03:18:19,135
There's a baby bear class action

4070
03:18:19,391 --> 03:18:22,719
Lawsuit of all the people that Alex Jones is Moline

4071
03:18:22,975 --> 03:18:25,535
Because it would probably be too difficult for like

4072
03:18:25,791 --> 03:18:26,559
One of them

4073
03:18:27,583 --> 03:18:28,863
Go through all the litigation

4074
03:18:29,119 --> 03:18:30,143
Maybe if

4075
03:18:30,399 --> 03:18:31,935
Tons of people who he's

4076
03:18:32,447 --> 03:18:34,239
Furiously

4077
03:18:34,751 --> 03:18:38,335
I got together

4078
03:18:39,871 --> 03:18:40,383
Pennywise

4079
03:18:40,895 --> 03:18:43,455
Alex you know he feels like he's being blamed

4080
03:18:45,503 --> 03:18:47,295
And he has a

4081
03:18:48,063 --> 03:18:48,575
Culprit

4082
03:18:49,087 --> 03:18:49,599
For the blind

4083
03:18:49,855 --> 03:18:51,135
Who's putting the blame on him

4084
03:18:51,647 --> 03:18:52,415
It's the splc

4085
03:18:53,183 --> 03:18:56,255
I want to go with me

4086
03:18:57,791 --> 03:19:03,935
It's qanon fault

4087
03:19:08,543 --> 03:19:12,895
Bostitch

4088
03:19:13,151 --> 03:19:16,991
Them

4089
03:19:17,247 --> 03:19:20,063
People going on social media

4090
03:19:33,631 --> 03:19:34,399
Probably will babe

4091
03:19:34,655 --> 03:19:35,423
Yelp

4092
03:19:35,679 --> 03:19:38,239
Do we get back to the my life now it is there at the end

4093
03:19:40,543 --> 03:19:42,591
Jordan did you know that you owe him cities

4094
03:19:42,847 --> 03:19:43,359
Still exist

4095
03:19:43,871 --> 03:19:44,895
I did not know that

4096
03:19:45,151 --> 03:19:46,175
Not that his

4097
03:19:47,455 --> 03:19:48,991
It does

4098
03:19:49,247 --> 03:19:50,527
God dammit

4099
03:19:55,391 --> 03:19:59,999
1973 by Robert Mueller a couple of Evangelical Church

4100
03:20:00,255 --> 03:20:01,023
Camps around the country

4101
03:20:01,535 --> 03:20:07,423
He had a smallish block that he gathered and they settled in the woods in Oklahoma to set up their isolated Utopia free

4102
03:20:07,679 --> 03:20:08,447
Government depression

4103
03:20:08,703 --> 03:20:10,495
Multiculturalism

4104
03:20:11,263 --> 03:20:13,311
Owosso they were adherence to the Christian identity

4105
03:20:14,079 --> 03:20:20,223
And honestly didn't feel like they're white supremacist beliefs it's just a recognition that they were white in their forecast

4106
03:20:22,783 --> 03:20:23,295
Keeps coming up

4107
03:20:23,807 --> 03:20:25,343
I had a lot of connections

4108
03:20:25,599 --> 03:20:27,647
To the Aryan Nation as most right-wing separate

4109
03:20:28,159 --> 03:20:28,671
Do

4110
03:20:28,927 --> 03:20:35,071
Porila he presidents were members of the Aryan Republican Army to bank robberies

4111
03:20:35,327 --> 03:20:36,863
For 1995

4112
03:20:37,119 --> 03:20:39,167
To get money to fund white supremacist group

4113
03:20:39,935 --> 03:20:44,031
Many believe that the 400-acre Elohim City compound provided a safe haven

4114
03:20:44,287 --> 03:20:45,823
Haven for a RX

4115
03:20:46,335 --> 03:20:46,847
To plan in

4116
03:20:48,127 --> 03:20:49,407
The splc was not running

4117
03:20:50,687 --> 03:20:52,223
They definitely

4118
03:20:52,479 --> 03:20:55,807
Sometime but nothing has been proven

4119
03:20:56,319 --> 03:20:59,135
The splc was founded two years prior to helium City

4120
03:20:59,391 --> 03:21:02,719
So you have to believe that his mother early projects

4121
03:21:02,975 --> 03:21:05,279
For twenty years or so before the Oklahoma City bombing

4122
03:21:05,535 --> 03:21:10,399
Or I guess you could imagine that they somehow took over the compound which is pretty unimaginable

4123
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:14,751
Considering Robert Mueller was in charge until he died in 2001

4124
03:21:15,007 --> 03:21:15,775
John is taking over

4125
03:21:16,287 --> 03:21:18,079
It doesn't make sense that these Hardline

4126
03:21:18,335 --> 03:21:19,615
Christian identity theft

4127
03:21:21,663 --> 03:21:22,431
Space

4128
03:21:22,687 --> 03:21:24,223
8 day would shoot

4129
03:21:24,735 --> 03:21:27,039
The splc trying to take over

4130
03:21:27,295 --> 03:21:29,343
Sites they don't shoot anybody who

4131
03:21:29,599 --> 03:21:33,951
Wearing a shirt that says it SPL and they just assumed that it has the sea

4132
03:21:35,231 --> 03:21:36,767
What else is claiming requires evidence

4133
03:21:37,279 --> 03:21:38,047
I need a provider

4134
03:21:41,631 --> 03:21:42,143
Climbing roses

4135
03:21:43,423 --> 03:21:46,751
It's real right-wing Terror groups and then

4136
03:21:47,007 --> 03:21:50,079
Audiological overlap and then making them all fake

4137
03:21:50,335 --> 03:21:56,479
Osher the Aryan Republican Army robbed a bunch of banks as part of a plan to violently overthrow the government

4138
03:21:56,735 --> 03:21:58,015
Who is Christian identity compound

4139
03:22:01,599 --> 03:22:05,439
None of it's real now those antifa contact contract that's all.

4140
03:22:05,695 --> 03:22:06,719
Those are totally real

4141
03:22:06,975 --> 03:22:09,279
The proof that the Soros is trying to start a race war

4142
03:22:11,327 --> 03:22:11,839
See how that works

4143
03:22:12,863 --> 03:22:14,911
How is manipulation work

4144
03:22:15,679 --> 03:22:16,191
Now Jordan

4145
03:22:16,447 --> 03:22:17,983
I know we're deep into this

4146
03:22:18,751 --> 03:22:19,775
But I think we're about to get our second

4147
03:22:20,799 --> 03:22:21,311
You know why

4148
03:22:22,335 --> 03:22:23,359
That's a bad guy

4149
03:22:23,871 --> 03:22:24,895
So far

4150
03:22:25,663 --> 03:22:26,175
S***

4151
03:22:26,431 --> 03:22:26,943
Mike Adams

4152
03:22:27,455 --> 03:22:27,967
Terrible

4153
03:22:28,479 --> 03:22:29,247
But I got to go

4154
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:30,271
Coming up for you

4155
03:22:30,527 --> 03:22:31,295
I know if you think

4156
03:22:32,575 --> 03:22:33,087
He's Neo

4157
03:22:33,855 --> 03:22:36,927
Oh no doubt of here stop it

4158
03:22:37,183 --> 03:22:42,815
Property of Matrix results

4159
03:22:46,911 --> 03:22:49,471
Leo zagami is back

4160
03:22:49,727 --> 03:22:51,519
These are the people who answer Alex's call

4161
03:22:51,775 --> 03:22:53,311
What the f*** is he doing on

4162
03:22:53,823 --> 03:22:55,103
It's unclear

4163
03:22:55,359 --> 03:22:57,663
But we do learn something

4164
03:22:58,175 --> 03:22:59,967
He brings up he's about to be on the show

4165
03:23:00,479 --> 03:23:00,991
And

4166
03:23:02,015 --> 03:23:02,527
Holy

4167
03:23:04,575 --> 03:23:05,087
We learn something

4168
03:23:05,855 --> 03:23:07,135
This is not a part of his backstory

4169
03:23:08,415 --> 03:23:12,767
Leo zagami

4170
03:23:13,279 --> 03:23:14,303
How much involved

4171
03:23:14,815 --> 03:23:20,959
Was that during operation

4172
03:23:27,359 --> 03:23:28,383
Feisty

4173
03:23:29,151 --> 03:23:31,199
So

4174
03:23:31,455 --> 03:23:33,247
Does my cell to bring some

4175
03:23:34,271 --> 03:23:40,415
It turns out not only is he the are the Illuminati throughout not only is being reincarnated Jesus

4176
03:23:41,183 --> 03:23:46,303
Not only is he single-handedly responsible for 911 he also apparently was involved in operation gladio

4177
03:23:47,071 --> 03:23:48,607
Leo zagami so full of s*** but

4178
03:23:49,887 --> 03:23:50,655
I really respect

4179
03:23:50,911 --> 03:23:51,423
Time for that

4180
03:23:51,935 --> 03:23:57,055
According to his own bio he was DJing in the UK and had become a fixture at a bar called Legend

4181
03:23:57,567 --> 03:24:00,127
When is career was disrupted when he had to return to Italy

4182
03:24:00,383 --> 03:24:02,943
Year of bollocks in the

4183
03:24:03,711 --> 03:24:05,247
That was in 1987

4184
03:24:05,759 --> 03:24:09,855
So allegedly Leo's in the military doing an obligatory year of bollocks

4185
03:24:10,367 --> 03:24:12,415
And that somehow light him to get mixed up in gladio

4186
03:24:12,927 --> 03:24:15,999
He was first publicly recognized by Italian authorities and 9th

4187
03:24:16,767 --> 03:24:19,583
So Alex is operational until 9

4188
03:24:22,655 --> 03:24:23,423
But this is not a

4189
03:24:24,191 --> 03:24:25,727
Even if you believe the widest Tire

4190
03:24:25,983 --> 03:24:29,055
Conspiracy version to what gladia was about it definitely was not an axe

4191
03:24:29,311 --> 03:24:29,823
In his latest 19

4192
03:24:30,847 --> 03:24:35,199
And a rave DJ doing the obligatory year of bollocks before going back to the club circuit

4193
03:24:35,455 --> 03:24:39,039
Would not be involved in any of the clandestine operations that were going on to begin with

4194
03:24:39,807 --> 03:24:41,087
So they weren't going on to begin with

4195
03:24:42,879 --> 03:24:47,743
He positions himself as like the Forrest Gump of stupid hundred percent

4196
03:24:48,255 --> 03:24:48,767
Accu

4197
03:24:49,023 --> 03:24:55,167
Anywhere and everywhere that even close.

4198
03:24:56,959 --> 03:24:59,263
I love the only thing Alex really has

4199
03:24:59,519 --> 03:25:02,079
Elvis narrative to his audience is that Leo's Italian

4200
03:25:02,591 --> 03:25:04,639
That's all you got

4201
03:25:04,895 --> 03:25:08,223
He might as well have a bucket

4202
03:25:09,759 --> 03:25:15,903
What's his name

4203
03:25:16,159 --> 03:25:18,463
There's literally zero other proof

4204
03:25:22,047 --> 03:25:22,815
Lexington being Italian

4205
03:25:23,839 --> 03:25:28,703
Call Trice everybody's stupid if you wasn't able to also as it relates to

4206
03:25:28,959 --> 03:25:32,287
Steve pieczenik what Alex is referring to is that Steve was involved in the Box

4207
03:25:32,543 --> 03:25:33,823
Hostage negotiation

4208
03:25:34,079 --> 03:25:36,383
Should have kidnapped Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro

4209
03:25:36,895 --> 03:25:43,039
It's a really insane complicated story that I would love to get into right now but even to the show

4210
03:25:43,295 --> 03:25:44,063
Deserves its own episode

4211
03:25:44,319 --> 03:25:45,599
So we might do that

4212
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:48,415
The tale of Steve pieczenik in Italy

4213
03:25:48,927 --> 03:25:49,951
Does real f*****-up stuff

4214
03:25:50,975 --> 03:25:51,999
Leo

4215
03:25:53,023 --> 03:25:53,791
Use Mio

4216
03:25:54,047 --> 03:25:54,815
Keith Lee

4217
03:25:56,607 --> 03:25:57,631
Heretostay

4218
03:25:57,887 --> 03:25:59,679
The profit

4219
03:25:59,935 --> 03:26:01,215
So he comes in here

4220
03:26:01,471 --> 03:26:03,007
He has a difference

4221
03:26:03,263 --> 03:26:03,775
About the shooter

4222
03:26:04,543 --> 03:26:06,335
And it's interesting because what you have to

4223
03:26:06,591 --> 03:26:07,103
Dislike

4224
03:26:07,615 --> 03:26:11,711
Even over the course the last like 3 hours that we've been talkin and listen to these clip

4225
03:26:12,223 --> 03:26:14,783
Multiple different explanations have been proffered

4226
03:26:15,039 --> 03:26:18,367
Are sort of compatible to each other in

4227
03:26:18,623 --> 03:26:21,183
It's some form literally

4228
03:26:21,439 --> 03:26:23,999
Every explanation that has been offered

4229
03:26:24,511 --> 03:26:25,023
Has

4230
03:26:25,279 --> 03:26:26,047
Ben

4231
03:26:26,303 --> 03:26:28,863
Far away from Occam's razor as

4232
03:26:29,119 --> 03:26:35,263
Building a house around that very specific razor in order to

4233
03:26:35,519 --> 03:26:36,287
If they don't f******

4234
03:26:37,567 --> 03:26:39,615
Tight even as the RZR tries to us

4235
03:26:40,383 --> 03:26:42,431
And tell them the very obvious

4236
03:26:42,687 --> 03:26:43,199
Reality

4237
03:26:44,223 --> 03:26:45,503
It's f****** God

4238
03:26:45,759 --> 03:26:46,271
Yeah

4239
03:26:46,783 --> 03:26:47,807
It's

4240
03:26:50,879 --> 03:26:52,415
Secure masculinity run-amok

4241
03:26:52,671 --> 03:26:55,231
Yep I'm sober

4242
03:26:59,327 --> 03:27:01,375
Unifying

4243
03:27:01,887 --> 03:27:03,935
That is behind all of the various different

4244
03:27:04,959 --> 03:27:07,519
Throwing out a number of different things

4245
03:27:08,031 --> 03:27:11,103
You know whether its brain control or their leftist

4246
03:27:11,359 --> 03:27:14,175
Soraya

4247
03:27:15,967 --> 03:27:18,527
After Next

4248
03:27:19,295 --> 03:27:21,599
It's still in the sort of feeling it out phase

4249
03:27:24,671 --> 03:27:26,463
And I guarantee that this is not what they're going to run

4250
03:27:26,975 --> 03:27:27,743
What Leo's galebe

4251
03:27:28,255 --> 03:27:29,023
To the table cuz this

4252
03:27:35,679 --> 03:27:36,959
Psychic

4253
03:27:44,383 --> 03:27:50,527
Weather

4254
03:28:08,959 --> 03:28:10,239
You're getting close to

4255
03:28:10,751 --> 03:28:12,031
Slandering this father

4256
03:28:13,311 --> 03:28:19,199
Dark psychic energy trigger word to activate the shooter

4257
03:28:19,455 --> 03:28:22,527
Okay you know I know I know a lot

4258
03:28:22,783 --> 03:28:23,551
I know a lot

4259
03:28:23,807 --> 03:28:25,343
About my impulsive

4260
03:28:26,367 --> 03:28:27,647
And they come from an upbringing

4261
03:28:30,207 --> 03:28:31,231
But God dammit

4262
03:28:31,487 --> 03:28:33,279
If I didn't want to f******

4263
03:28:33,535 --> 03:28:37,119
Slap Leo zagami after I heard him say those words

4264
03:28:37,375 --> 03:28:39,679
Never a good idea no violence

4265
03:28:40,959 --> 03:28:42,751
F*** somebody needs to slap him

4266
03:28:43,007 --> 03:28:45,567
I don't know I don't know I think it's

4267
03:28:46,847 --> 03:28:51,455
The shooter's father

4268
03:28:52,735 --> 03:28:54,783
I don't know how deep

4269
03:28:56,319 --> 03:28:57,087
It was not a sir

4270
03:28:57,343 --> 03:28:57,855
Substantial

4271
03:28:58,111 --> 03:28:59,903
Care

4272
03:29:00,159 --> 03:29:01,183
Who cares

4273
03:29:01,439 --> 03:29:02,719
Shut the f****** Leo

4274
03:29:04,255 --> 03:29:06,047
Rhetorical

4275
03:29:06,303 --> 03:29:07,071
May 13th

4276
03:29:07,327 --> 03:29:10,911
Where he came from

4277
03:29:11,423 --> 03:29:12,703
So Alex app

4278
03:29:13,727 --> 03:29:14,751
Rhetoric

4279
03:29:15,007 --> 03:29:15,775
But I actually haven't

4280
03:29:17,055 --> 03:29:18,335
Spiral

4281
03:29:18,591 --> 03:29:19,103
After

4282
03:29:19,359 --> 03:29:19,871
Asking this question

4283
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:21,407
Not coming to a good aunt

4284
03:29:22,175 --> 03:29:23,455
Into

4285
03:29:26,271 --> 03:29:28,063
I have the sense of urgency

4286
03:29:28,575 --> 03:29:32,671
The ships of I'm upset at myself that there's something I need to do

4287
03:29:34,975 --> 03:29:36,511
I just wish

4288
03:29:37,535 --> 03:29:39,839
Because we know more is coming

4289
03:29:43,935 --> 03:29:45,215
They were so sloppy

4290
03:29:45,471 --> 03:29:47,775
They didn't even cover up their social media

4291
03:29:48,287 --> 03:29:51,103
When I said I hate God I hate Christians I hate

4292
03:29:55,967 --> 03:29:58,783
Replaced with fake stuff

4293
03:29:59,039 --> 03:30:02,623
Wayback machine

4294
03:30:04,415 --> 03:30:05,439
Hail Satan

4295
03:30:06,463 --> 03:30:08,767
Washington realty

4296
03:30:15,167 --> 03:30:15,935
These

4297
03:30:16,191 --> 03:30:17,983
Expanding this my life narrative

4298
03:30:19,007 --> 03:30:20,799
When he starts that he's like

4299
03:30:21,567 --> 03:30:22,079
What can I

4300
03:30:22,335 --> 03:30:23,103
Say to stop

4301
03:30:23,359 --> 03:30:25,919
Honestly him saying that makes me want to cry

4302
03:30:26,175 --> 03:30:28,735
I heard him say that

4303
03:30:28,991 --> 03:30:31,295
The answer is literally the opposite of everything

4304
03:30:31,551 --> 03:30:32,063
Can you f****** say

4305
03:30:36,927 --> 03:30:38,975
Cuz we all know this is going to happen again

4306
03:30:39,231 --> 03:30:39,743
Yep

4307
03:30:39,999 --> 03:30:41,023
That makes me

4308
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:41,791
How to f****** cry

4309
03:30:42,047 --> 03:30:45,375
There's a very queer thing that he could do

4310
03:30:46,911 --> 03:30:48,191
Admit that he's been

4311
03:30:48,447 --> 03:30:54,591
Scamming people for a very long time

4312
03:30:55,871 --> 03:30:59,455
F****** mom

4313
03:30:59,711 --> 03:31:00,735
Zelda trying to take gun

4314
03:31:01,247 --> 03:31:05,343
He's like the US is one of the only countries

4315
03:31:06,111 --> 03:31:07,903
Because we got to advance give it cuz we got to get

4316
03:31:08,927 --> 03:31:09,695
Because not only

4317
03:31:09,951 --> 03:31:10,719
Was Leo zagami

4318
03:31:10,975 --> 03:31:11,743
In Gladiator

4319
03:31:12,255 --> 03:31:13,535
We find out he was also

4320
03:31:13,791 --> 03:31:14,559
Your Forrest Gump

4321
03:31:14,815 --> 03:31:16,351
Analogy so right

4322
03:31:16,607 --> 03:31:17,119
Elizabeth

4323
03:31:26,079 --> 03:31:32,223
And very easily to

4324
03:31:32,479 --> 03:31:36,319
Amina

4325
03:31:42,975 --> 03:31:45,279
So he's infiltrated

4326
03:31:45,535 --> 03:31:47,583
He is got some solid Improv

4327
03:31:47,839 --> 03:31:51,679
Because there's no way he had that in his back pocket

4328
03:31:51,935 --> 03:31:58,079
Before getting on the show

4329
03:32:01,407 --> 03:32:07,039
That's pulled from thin air not in favor of torture

4330
03:32:07,295 --> 03:32:08,319
So I would not do any

4331
03:32:09,087 --> 03:32:09,855
But I would love

4332
03:32:10,623 --> 03:32:12,159
To make some sort of an arrangement

4333
03:32:12,927 --> 03:32:13,951
Where Leo zagami wood

4334
03:32:14,719 --> 03:32:15,231
Answer my question

4335
03:32:15,743 --> 03:32:18,815
About everything

4336
03:32:20,351 --> 03:32:22,655
Tell the truth or just answer the question

4337
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:29,311
Tell the truth

4338
03:32:29,567 --> 03:32:31,615
1 interview a good singer

4339
03:32:31,871 --> 03:32:35,967
And one where he gets to tell the truth I think I would prefer the one where he gets to lie cuz it'd be way more yet

4340
03:32:37,503 --> 03:32:42,111
Stories of his early DJ real crazy

4341
03:32:45,439 --> 03:32:49,535
You think something is pretty Lucid you said he was known as I mean just of those days

4342
03:32:50,303 --> 03:32:54,911
You said he was known as the guy you are not all drugs ruin your memory

4343
03:32:55,167 --> 03:32:56,959
That's her so

4344
03:32:57,215 --> 03:32:59,519
Alex makes the we're coming to the end

4345
03:33:00,031 --> 03:33:01,567
Eclipse

4346
03:33:01,823 --> 03:33:02,335
I think

4347
03:33:03,359 --> 03:33:05,407
You see where Alex

4348
03:33:07,967 --> 03:33:08,991
Stop.

4349
03:33:09,503 --> 03:33:12,063
No no no

4350
03:33:12,319 --> 03:33:13,343
19 shows up

4351
03:33:14,111 --> 03:33:14,623
Restart

4352
03:33:14,879 --> 03:33:15,391
Panicky pretty

4353
03:33:16,671 --> 03:33:17,695
He gets really extreme

4354
03:33:18,463 --> 03:33:19,231
And then he ends

4355
03:33:19,487 --> 03:33:21,023
The show without writing arson

4356
03:33:22,303 --> 03:33:23,583
Here's the first clip where you make

4357
03:33:23,839 --> 03:33:24,351
Is

4358
03:33:24,863 --> 03:33:26,143
Insane prediction

4359
03:33:26,399 --> 03:33:26,911
And keep in mind

4360
03:33:27,167 --> 03:33:28,191
Feed store

4361
03:33:28,447 --> 03:33:29,727
Throughout this episode

4362
03:33:29,983 --> 03:33:31,007
Both of these episodes

4363
03:33:31,263 --> 03:33:35,103
Is trying to defend himself by a question question the events

4364
03:33:35,871 --> 03:33:37,407
Keep in mind this is a question

4365
03:33:37,919 --> 03:33:39,199
This is making a prediction

4366
03:33:40,223 --> 03:33:41,759
We now know this is happening

4367
03:33:55,583 --> 03:33:57,631
This is

4368
03:34:01,727 --> 03:34:03,263
Questioning

4369
03:34:03,519 --> 03:34:09,663
Become the product of all the narratives that you created over the course of a lifetime

4370
03:34:09,919 --> 03:34:14,015
Today's this is the now I am experiencing the narratives that I have

4371
03:34:14,271 --> 03:34:15,039
I built

4372
03:34:15,295 --> 03:34:16,063
Along the way

4373
03:34:16,319 --> 03:34:18,367
This is a natural end result

4374
03:34:18,879 --> 03:34:21,951
If if all of this other stuff that I've said over the course

4375
03:34:22,207 --> 03:34:24,767
These episodes is truth

4376
03:34:25,023 --> 03:34:26,559
The globalist are making their move

4377
03:34:27,327 --> 03:34:29,119
Which I mean we hear that all the f****** time

4378
03:34:29,375 --> 03:34:31,935
But because of the severity of the real world

4379
03:34:32,191 --> 03:34:32,703
Situation

4380
03:34:32,959 --> 03:34:33,983
It become so much worse

4381
03:34:34,751 --> 03:34:36,287
But he's using real tragedy

4382
03:34:37,055 --> 03:34:38,079
To say

4383
03:34:40,383 --> 03:34:41,151
Standard

4384
03:34:42,431 --> 03:34:43,967
That's What It All Leads to

4385
03:34:44,223 --> 03:34:45,503
Just the same s***

4386
03:34:46,015 --> 03:34:47,039
Yeah that's really offense

4387
03:34:47,551 --> 03:34:49,087
Going over the past two days

4388
03:34:50,111 --> 03:34:50,623
Hoi

4389
03:34:51,647 --> 03:34:52,159
Almost

4390
03:34:52,671 --> 03:34:53,439
Watching a man

4391
03:34:54,463 --> 03:34:54,975
Some selfies

4392
03:34:55,487 --> 03:34:59,071
Not as okay yeah

4393
03:34:59,327 --> 03:35:01,887
This entire thing is him creating all of these narrow

4394
03:35:02,143 --> 03:35:02,911
I do and

4395
03:35:03,423 --> 03:35:05,983
Other people adding in narratives on top of that

4396
03:35:06,239 --> 03:35:07,263
All of which is to

4397
03:35:07,519 --> 03:35:08,031
To distract him

4398
03:35:08,287 --> 03:35:10,335
Self from the fact that he's a f****** murder

4399
03:35:11,359 --> 03:35:12,383
You know well

4400
03:35:12,895 --> 03:35:13,663
If you think that

4401
03:35:16,479 --> 03:35:18,527
Episode wraps up

4402
03:35:20,063 --> 03:35:20,831
Pretty

4403
03:35:21,343 --> 03:35:23,903
He almost seems to be expanding who he'd like to see

4404
03:35:24,159 --> 03:35:24,671
If you targeted

4405
03:35:53,087 --> 03:35:59,231
There's no war against the devil

4406
03:36:02,047 --> 03:36:07,167
So I mean he's calling for a holy war that he says is already here and it's a war between

4407
03:36:07,423 --> 03:36:08,447
His version of

4408
03:36:08,703 --> 03:36:10,239
Christianity I suppose

4409
03:36:10,495 --> 03:36:16,639
And all Satanist to include atheist or Satanist but don't know their atheist

4410
03:36:16,895 --> 03:36:20,223
Don't believe glitterbug

4411
03:36:21,503 --> 03:36:27,647
Hillary Clinton has literally been there sooner

4412
03:36:27,903 --> 03:36:32,511
The battle between his Christian

4413
03:36:32,767 --> 03:36:33,279
Beliefs

4414
03:36:33,535 --> 03:36:34,559
Against everybody

4415
03:36:35,071 --> 03:36:36,351
This is apocalyptic nonsense

4416
03:36:36,863 --> 03:36:37,887
And it's f****** Danger

4417
03:36:38,143 --> 03:36:38,655
Yeah

4418
03:36:38,911 --> 03:36:39,679
I don't want

4419
03:36:39,935 --> 03:36:40,703
I want to

4420
03:36:40,959 --> 03:36:42,495
Get into a war

4421
03:36:42,751 --> 03:36:43,519
Because

4422
03:36:43,775 --> 03:36:45,311
The right-wing terrorist

4423
03:36:45,567 --> 03:36:46,335
Committed an act

4424
03:36:46,591 --> 03:36:48,383
Terrorism and then blamed it on

4425
03:36:48,639 --> 03:36:49,151
The left

4426
03:36:49,919 --> 03:36:51,455
And used it to justify

4427
03:36:52,223 --> 03:36:53,503
Calling for a holy war

4428
03:36:53,759 --> 03:36:54,783
I don't like that

4429
03:36:55,295 --> 03:36:57,855
That seems unfair at

4430
03:36:58,111 --> 03:37:01,183
Least at least it seems like an escalation

4431
03:37:01,439 --> 03:37:03,231
Uncalled for

4432
03:37:03,743 --> 03:37:08,863
Here and it starts with what I would describe as kind of an Evangelical

4433
03:37:11,167 --> 03:37:12,703
Expect

4434
03:37:13,215 --> 03:37:15,775
It's super weird that a lot of people don't understand this

4435
03:37:16,031 --> 03:37:18,335
We don't maybe make another point of it

4436
03:37:18,591 --> 03:37:20,383
So often the show does just turn in

4437
03:37:20,639 --> 03:37:21,407
To like

4438
03:37:21,919 --> 03:37:24,479
Who got a weird religious

4439
03:37:24,735 --> 03:37:25,247
Taliban

4440
03:37:25,759 --> 03:37:29,087
Yeah yeah but it's very quickly veers off course

4441
03:37:29,343 --> 03:37:30,111
Into

4442
03:37:30,367 --> 03:37:32,159
What are described as Alex almost

4443
03:37:32,415 --> 03:37:32,927
Defining

4444
03:37:33,183 --> 03:37:33,695
Himself

4445
03:37:33,951 --> 03:37:34,463
As what you need to

4446
03:37:35,743 --> 03:37:38,047
Lucian here

4447
03:37:38,303 --> 03:37:41,375
Across the country in the world

4448
03:37:41,631 --> 03:37:43,679
In the time of Christ

4449
03:37:44,191 --> 03:37:44,959
Justice and

4450
03:37:45,215 --> 03:37:45,727
For freedom

4451
03:37:45,983 --> 03:37:48,543
Dodge Spirit

4452
03:37:49,055 --> 03:37:51,103
It's also time to be politically

4453
03:37:51,359 --> 03:37:52,383
And culturally active

4454
03:37:52,895 --> 03:37:56,735
It's time to spread the word about infowars.com and it was worse.

4455
03:37:56,991 --> 03:38:02,623
Common override the AI

4456
03:38:02,879 --> 03:38:04,927
Here's the name that must not be spoken

4457
03:38:10,303 --> 03:38:11,327
That is the future

4458
03:38:11,583 --> 03:38:12,863
The globalist poison

4459
03:38:13,375 --> 03:38:19,519
There's a sense there that's almost like it starts with him saying you got to go get

4460
03:38:19,775 --> 03:38:24,639
I get people to come to the globalist

4461
03:38:24,895 --> 03:38:26,175
I Am The Cure

4462
03:38:26,431 --> 03:38:30,015
That is a level of Messianic narcissism

4463
03:38:30,527 --> 03:38:35,135
It's coming on the heels of him talking with Leo zagami about having a holy war

4464
03:38:36,159 --> 03:38:36,927
Contacts of all of this

4465
03:38:37,439 --> 03:38:37,951
It's just

4466
03:38:38,463 --> 03:38:38,975
This isn't

4467
03:38:39,231 --> 03:38:39,743
Sanity

4468
03:38:39,999 --> 03:38:41,279
This whole thing is insane

4469
03:38:42,559 --> 03:38:45,119
Gavin riding this thing so I've been doing a bunch of research

4470
03:38:45,375 --> 03:38:45,887
Can do all kinds of

4471
03:38:46,399 --> 03:38:47,935
Let me into rereading the new

4472
03:38:48,447 --> 03:38:49,983
Testament actually

4473
03:38:50,239 --> 03:38:51,263
Earlier today

4474
03:38:51,775 --> 03:38:52,799
And if there is

4475
03:38:54,335 --> 03:38:57,663
Who is going to hell according to Jesus's rules

4476
03:38:58,431 --> 03:38:59,455
Alex is

4477
03:39:01,247 --> 03:39:07,391
Even trouble even is that clip his nails like half the Beatitudes he's gone with the sermon

4478
03:39:07,647 --> 03:39:13,791
Get the f*** out of here with that s*** well that's just for glitterbug

4479
03:39:14,047 --> 03:39:14,815
Yeah

4480
03:39:16,607 --> 03:39:20,703
Cowboys

4481
03:39:20,959 --> 03:39:22,495
He's in trouble

4482
03:39:26,335 --> 03:39:26,847
It's been long

4483
03:39:27,359 --> 03:39:27,871
I'm exhausted

4484
03:39:28,895 --> 03:39:30,687
Emotionally

4485
03:39:34,527 --> 03:39:36,319
Kind of weird that we didn't

4486
03:39:36,575 --> 03:39:37,343
You talk that much

4487
03:39:37,599 --> 03:39:38,111
About the shoes

4488
03:39:40,159 --> 03:39:43,231
Or anything at all

4489
03:39:43,487 --> 03:39:46,303
Perfect I don't know if it's weird or not

4490
03:39:46,559 --> 03:39:47,071
But

4491
03:39:48,607 --> 03:39:49,887
What we're Alex light

4492
03:39:51,167 --> 03:39:51,679
That's

4493
03:39:52,703 --> 03:39:53,215
Kind of

4494
03:39:53,727 --> 03:39:55,007
Weary Where We Are

4495
03:39:55,263 --> 03:39:58,847
Why would Alex want to go anywhere near the reality sales

4496
03:39:59,103 --> 03:40:00,639
Why would you want to go anywhere

4497
03:40:01,407 --> 03:40:01,919
You cannot

4498
03:40:02,175 --> 03:40:04,479
Learn anything about those shootings and not go

4499
03:40:04,991 --> 03:40:07,551
Oh f*** we've got a real problem

4500
03:40:07,807 --> 03:40:10,111
Tales of these shootings

4501
03:40:10,623 --> 03:40:11,391
Point two

4502
03:40:11,647 --> 03:40:12,415
Many very proud

4503
03:40:13,183 --> 03:40:14,975
The shootings themselves

4504
03:40:15,231 --> 03:40:15,999
Are part of

4505
03:40:16,511 --> 03:40:17,023
The problem

4506
03:40:19,071 --> 03:40:19,583
Guns

4507
03:40:20,607 --> 03:40:22,911
That's that

4508
03:40:23,423 --> 03:40:25,727
We should absolutely be talkin about

4509
03:40:25,983 --> 03:40:26,495
Supremacist

4510
03:40:26,751 --> 03:40:27,263
Terrorism

4511
03:40:28,287 --> 03:40:30,335
Rampant we should be talking about

4512
03:40:30,591 --> 03:40:32,383
Misogynist dudes who are

4513
03:40:34,175 --> 03:40:38,271
Man would be able to kill all these people they didn't have f****** an automatic rifle

4514
03:40:38,527 --> 03:40:40,319
That's true they didn't have all these f***

4515
03:40:40,575 --> 03:40:41,087
10 guns

4516
03:40:41,343 --> 03:40:45,951
Conversation that I can have on the best

4517
03:40:46,207 --> 03:40:47,487
Gun control measures

4518
03:40:47,743 --> 03:40:50,303
But they sure as f*** wouldn't have walked into a Walmart

4519
03:40:50,559 --> 03:40:52,351
And killed all these people if they didn't have

4520
03:40:52,607 --> 03:40:53,119
F******

4521
03:40:54,911 --> 03:40:57,727
There's a hundred other problems that they were facing them

4522
03:40:57,983 --> 03:40:58,751
This country

4523
03:40:59,007 --> 03:41:02,079
You know I don't mean to give short shrift to any of them by focusing on this

4524
03:41:02,591 --> 03:41:05,151
But it's what Alex is talking about Judaism

4525
03:41:07,455 --> 03:41:10,271
About Friday

4526
03:41:10,527 --> 03:41:13,087
Bless this

4527
03:41:16,927 --> 03:41:23,071
Website.com

4528
03:41:23,327 --> 03:41:26,911
Facebook you could download

4529
03:41:27,167 --> 03:41:27,679
ITunes

4530
03:41:27,935 --> 03:41:29,471
You could also leave a review

4531
03:41:29,727 --> 03:41:30,751
You can also just

4532
03:41:31,007 --> 03:41:32,799
Scour the internet for different things

4533
03:41:33,055 --> 03:41:34,079
Is that have both knowledge and

4534
03:41:34,335 --> 03:41:35,103
And fighting them

4535
03:41:35,359 --> 03:41:36,127
Generally speaking

4536
03:41:36,383 --> 03:41:38,175
Episodes of our show

4537
03:41:40,223 --> 03:41:40,991
You rarely see

4538
03:41:41,247 --> 03:41:42,015
Stay EDG

4539
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:47,647
Put a little

4540
03:41:47,903 --> 03:41:51,743
I don't feel like our outro is particularly appropriate

4541
03:41:52,767 --> 03:41:54,815
This episode

4542
03:41:57,375 --> 03:41:59,679
I am the Jesus Lizard

4543
03:42:05,823 --> 03:42:09,407
Alex
