My bright spot is something it'll be a bright spot 2

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
For you to hear perhaps season

10
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,032
Listen to some music

11
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
Look that I've heard in a long time

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
Annie Lennox Annie Lennox

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
I don't know why but I listen to soundtrack

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
Good atmospheric music I enjoy the feeling soundtrack from the 1984 David Lynch film

15
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Gather some

16
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,352
There's a little bit

17
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
But a little bit little bit of dialogue

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
Now I'm asking you this question

19
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008
Do you know who did the soundtrack to do in it

20
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
The 1984 movie

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Resume

22
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,136
But the Brian Brian Brian Davie no I don't know

25
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,232
Always write a disorder but you know who else

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
The band Toto

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,544

What it what is closer to Africa been doing I think that's the only thing that makes sense anyway soundtrack

30
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
That was fun

31
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
I don't have time

32
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
Sting performances legendarily quiet

33
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
Start timer movie

34
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,560
Plenty of time for the soundtrack

35
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Fair enough fair enough

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352

Freakishly large

68
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,655
Thank you so much Adam Mandalorian

69
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Enjoy the show

70
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Export these Gents

71
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Website.com

72
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
Thinking about those workers show we would appreciate that if you'd like please feel free to take that energy and direct it to

73
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
Do a local charity in your area that's helping people who are affected

74
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
Goodbye the current trouble

75
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
We would appreciate

76
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,927
So Jordan like I said April 17th

77
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
It's going down

78
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
It is it is going down

79
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
I don't know how

80
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
Alex's just bought some b*******

81
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
The day before

82
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
It's on Thursday it came out that

83
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
A bunch of Infowars employees got kicked off

84
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
Yes and buy a bunch I mean Rob do

85
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
Andover Drive

86
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
Who got kicked off and

87
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
It's not about getting rid of

88
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
Exercising all Infowars a choice it has to do with the fact that the two of them Paul

89
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
And Owen were Act

90
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Italy promoting

91
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Is protest

92
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Against

93
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
The quarantine

94
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
I actually

95
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
Did the protest

96
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,895
It was that they were using Twitter to spread promotion of it

97
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
16th to 17th

98
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
You just had some tendrils

99
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
Stop chopped off

100
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Is getting his word out

101
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
So you know it is about what you do

102
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
Expecting that it's also not what you'd expect

103
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
The men also

104
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Pretty f*****-up

105
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,143
So let's jump and here's the first clip Alex is talking

106
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
About course

107
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Because

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
These people who work for him were kicked off social media

109
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,871
Obviously there's going to be some social media grievances on this episode

110
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
There had been draconians developments

111
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
Dreamed of just six months ago

112
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
Unfolded carry could this

113
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,463
Agree with you

114
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Members of

115
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
The Congress

116
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,631
When they say that the coronavirus came out of the Wuhan lab

117
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
They're openly

118
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
Announcing that I got all the Articles right here

119
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
Strong suspicion that he's starting off this way so we can complain about Owen and Rob getting kicked off Twitter

120
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
But you would

121
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
You can count it

122
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Coated in this language of universal censorship that's the way that he can get away with throwing a little while pretending

123
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
He's mad about something other than his employees losing their social media account

124
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,839
And their ability to Market on Twitter

125
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,703
Heady dinner

126
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
But he respects

127
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
And Robert Barr

128
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,711
Time to book on record and said they have no idea why Owens account was suspended but it's super clear

129
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Like I said

130
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
In the days prior to the suspension

131
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Promoting his

132
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,391
You can't close America rally which took place over this weekend

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
According to reporting on Media Matters Twitter had announced on March 18th

134
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
They were not allowing

135
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,095
Quote tweets that could place people at higher risk of transmitting covid

136
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
19

137
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
And if you think about it for any time at all

138
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,495
Using his account to promote a giant rally in the middle of an active pandemic

139
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
Is basically is clear and example that is you can come up

140
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
Now we'll Twitter apply that logic to Trump

141
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Probably not

142
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
But even if their enforcement is less-than-ideal it's pretty indisputable that owners acting in ways that are directly counter to the rules

143
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
It had been established by Twitter

144
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
They took action when he was suspended

145
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
The same is true most likely dues account and like I said it's probably why David night Paul Joseph

146
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Still up

147
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Because they were too

148
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Explicitly engaging in Behavior

149
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Do directly lead to people putting themselves

150
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
A community at risk

151
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
I have no idea what Congress members Alex is talking about Sons

152
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
I can't find any stories about this even on his

153
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
Wheatley unnavigable website

154
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,783
But I would assume it's just a situation where they are subject to the rules of the platform as well as anybody else

155
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
50 faith and Twitter's commitment to upholding these

156
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,439
These rules and considering the trouble literally tweeted out multiple exhortation

157
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,023
For various states with Democratic Governors to be quote liberated

158
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
It's pretty clear the problem

159
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
It's far past

160
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
Anywhere any social media company can even handle it now

161
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
It's super clear what the messages does liberate

162
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Starbucks

163
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
According to NBC News a spokesperson for Twitter said quote the use of liberate in the pizzas too vague to be at

164
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Actionable

165
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,039
When the president of the country is on social media saying a liberate Minnesota and liberate Michigan and

166
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,135
Liberate Virginia and Saviour great second amendment is under siege

167
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
If your rules consider those statements be too vague to be actionable

168
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
The new rules are meaningless and really just sound more like

169
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Cop out then anything else

170
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Of course

171
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Trump Twitter

172
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Be good either and would also

173
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,239
Likely lead to a far more severe backlash particularly in an Alexa

174
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
There's essentially no good answer here the people in a position to actually make it

175
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Decision like

176
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,711
To say that there is no reason they would ever suspend Trump or to apply the rules to him

177
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Refuse to pick

178
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
The fear of the outcome

179
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
Whatever Alex wants to

180
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
Complain about his own personal problems

181
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
Still whatever he does that he has a tendency to externalize them

182
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Exaggerate

183
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
When he got a DUI one of the first responses was to put on his Jonathan Swift

184
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,143
And suggested all restaurants should be closed cuz if you have one drink will get a DUI and then everyone's

185
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Get jammed up

186
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
It was a massive societal issue that he was upset about

187
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Not the fact that he drank and drove

188
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
And spent the night in jail

189
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Is it the same thing

190
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,711
Is employees got punished on social media and Alex knows that having the lead stories like that

191
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,039
Hey my employees that sounds weak

192
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Siri frame it is a story

193
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
You're not about to

194
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
It's not about your person

195
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Interest

196
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:42,559
About the world you can portray yourself as a champion another week loser

197
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,959
Maybe I'm talking about this because they personally affected me and if it hadn't personally affected me I wouldn't give a s*** about that but this

198
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
Sisme I'm the butt of the spear dad

199
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Yeah

200
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
So

201
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,383
This is this goes away out of control

202
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,431
You know I mean like it starts with this

203
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
This

204
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,039
Externalizing in in in exaggerating of

205
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
He's employees being suspended their couch

206
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
But this turns into like

207
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
A massive

208
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Narrative on this show

209
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
About

210
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
The the who's doing

211
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
The dispensary

212
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Exactly

213
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,239
Europe

214
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Australia

215
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Children

216
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Do not try

217
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Watch them carefully

218
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Rapport

219
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Them

220
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
China is behind the virus

221
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
That's good advice

222
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Wuhan

223
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
The other side

224
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Church

225
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
Bio weapon lab

226
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,407
Is number 2 in a man

227
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
So that's not true

228
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
Weapon Labs have like a social media division there or section division

229
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,719
We need to really do a better job as best we can of pushing back to something

230
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,071
Framing in the language calling it a bioweapon lab we just put up with

231
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
And just like whatever puts Move Along honestly that in itself is terrible

232
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Idea

233
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Yeah

234
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Leaving that aside

235
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,455
The real story is that there's apparently someone who works for one of the groups that Facebook uses

236
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
For fact-checking

237
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,575
Anderson

238
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,207
Professor with many published articles on a field of virology and infectious diseases

239
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,839
He's a professor at Duke nus Medical School which is a collaboration between Duke

240
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
Any National University of Singapore

241
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
And the very legitimate and accredited

242
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
It's cool

243
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,567
Dinner time at the field of virology she's done some collaborative projects with the researchers

244
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
Happy Wuhan in

245
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,223
Do the virologia into the Wuhan lab running the fact-checking about the virus

246
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,783
Which just isn't accurate adult wow they are

247
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:16,415
They are really scraping the bottom of the barrel is it really going really not giving a f***

248
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,255
Expert who was consulted by an organization called health

249
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Which is not owned by Facebook

250
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,911
If you was there an independent political entity that fact checks medical claim

251
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
Many of the outlets and abusing their work

252
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
The Source because it's solidly produced

253
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,127
Hope feedback is One Wing of a group called science feedback

254
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:42,527
They also have like climatefeedback.org organization

255
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
Scientists knock this s*** off their website include the section that lists all their donors from $5 donations up to 5000

256
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Dollar Plus

257
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
List all the grants they received

258
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,887
As far as things that like this guy rarely seen this level of transparency from anything else I've looked at

259
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,263
Do you know Koch brothers folding I imagine that Mark Moreno works for them

260
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,311
Time to time like they really ever

261
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:10,943
What now absent from that page the money to be found

262
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,039
This relationship with Facebook that's where things get a little bit complicated

263
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,183
In April 2019 science feedback was approved as one of the entities that helps with Facebook's fact check

264
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
But it wasn't approved by face

265
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
Facebook as a pre-existing relationship with a group called

266
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
Pointers International fact-checking Network

267
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:34,495
Weaver is a group that approved the fact-checking entities which then helped fact-checked stuff on Facebook

268
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
If I had to guess

269
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
I would take this Arrangement exists so Facebook and talk as much

270
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,687
Responsibility as possible what happens on its platform is kind of like

271
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
100%

272
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
The reality is that there was an

273
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
Expert advice virologia infectious disease who teaches at University in Singapore who has worked at the wuhan.lab in the

274
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,791
She was consulted by Health feedback for a fact check on some claims that were made about

275
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Lab in Wuhan

276
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
This story is not being changed by Alex into a situation where the fact-checking is being run out of the Wuhan lab would you can easily see you

277
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Eli

278
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,383
Van if doctor Anderson were trying to obscure or hide her association with the lab in Wuhan

279
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,991
Probably make a pretty decent argument for some kind of conflict of interest Maybe

280
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,063
It might come off as a bit unethical to use her as a reference

281
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
But as it stands

282
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,927
She's completely open about her working at that lab periodically

283
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
I on some project

284
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,815
In the very article when she's consulted as an expert

285
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Kind of gives

286
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,191
More Credence to her that like that's why you would go to her because she's actually

287
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
F****** been there

288
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Relationship

289
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Of her feedback

290
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Slippers elf

291
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Yeah

292
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
There's no indication that she runs it

293
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Write any of that stuff

294
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
But just choose someone who was consulted by these people for a fact check

295
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,583
Take over as Alex's number one narrative

296
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
But there's some things that I get lost

297
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
Along the way gets a little sidetracked on

298
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Because you seen 84

299
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
For these guys is a

300
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Patience

301
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
My favorite books

302
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Manual

303
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Start

304
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
Directly into your face

305
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
For how much

306
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
Get to the point here I should say that's what you was heard there was Alex making a real big show out of drinking from a paper cut button

307
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
Swirling the ice around

308
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
Which is not exactly what I would call in character for him

309
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
I see them pics wigs everything seemed like

310
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,863
Give coffee mug and sometimes you'll have bottles like Topo Chico on hand but this is

311
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
Very showy

312
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
Taunton and it worries me a little bit boy

313
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
No idea Facebook

314
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
I have no idea

315
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
But if it is

316
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
We are three minutes into the episode at this point

317
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
That would spell trouble

318
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
That's called the beginning of the work

319
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
And it's when you take your first drink

320
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
I'm not convinced

321
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
Necessarily from the way this episode Ghost

322
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
But he was drink

323
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
I'm not I'm not sure

324
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
Is it possible but I'm not I'm not I'm not sold on

325
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,839
He does get real weird by the end of the episode but it's not like

326
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,935
It's not definitive in the same way that so many of these others

327
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,519
Yesterday clip first of all Hillary was not co-president

328
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
That's just nonsense

329
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Second

330
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,711
Alex isn't talking about comments Hillary made back in the 90s and she didn't say 1984 was a how-to manual

331
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
That's just a stupid headline that French

332
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,135
Conservative blogs ran with when discussing an excerpt from her 2017 book titled what happened

333
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
In the book's you rights quotes

334
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,767
Attempting to Define reality is a core feature of authoritarian

335
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,375
This is what the Soviets did when they erased political distance from historical photos

336
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
This is what happens in George Orwell's classic novel 1984

337
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,567
When a torturer holds up four fingers and delivers electric shocks until his prisoner sees five

338
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Fingers as order

339
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:28,223
The goal is to make you question logic and reason I just don't mistrust towards exactly the people we need to rely on

340
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
Our leaders the Press

341
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,831
Expert usikiaye public policy based on evidence

342
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Ourselves

343
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,183
For Trump is as with so much as he does

344
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
It's about simple dominant

345
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,559
Alex is making up a Hillary quote and here's the fun part

346
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
I know exactly where it comes from

347
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
There was an article in

348
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
2017 about this passage from Hillary's book

349
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
On the website

350
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Conservative review

351
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
And the headline is quote

352
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,383
Hillary Clinton thinks Orwell's 1984 is a how-to manual

353
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,479
I really don't get where they saw that in the quote

354
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,599
No it's not it's not in that quote and that's where Alex got the idea from

355
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
In the article if you actually read it it doesn't include any quotes for saying that it's just the insinuation of the author of this blog post

356
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:18,911
He's grape is that he feels that Hillary got the wrong message from 1984 and that her point was to encourage blind

357
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Trust in the government and media

358
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,263
I think that's a little bit of an unfair reading from the text

359
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,871
Particularly considering the last thing in her list of people we need to rely on ourselves

360
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
But whatever

361
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
I'm not going to spend my time discussing

362
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
Circle in any way passing

363
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,783
But this headline is absolutely where Alex

364
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
Something is imaginary Hillary quote from

365
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
He is me either

366
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,439
Not read this article at all or he's willfully lying about it one of the two

367
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
You know what's it what what is interesting is that in a sense

368
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
I agree with the Sun

369
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
1984 is a how-to manual

370
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,447
I just think Trump is using it not the other guy

371
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,567
Emmanuel could be in

372
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
Some context of value neutral site

373
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
The terrorists like that is not to say that George Washington was a evil there red right

374
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,767
I'm not I don't want to I don't want to unpack that right now but

375
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
There are ways you can

376
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,191
Don't say something like 94 is a how-to manual without endorsing

377
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:30,335
That's all fine that's all good well even if Hillary had said something like that

378
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,735
She didn't f****** conservative review blog post headline

379
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,319
Don't they have to not read them in order to maintain their their strength

380
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
Like Samson like if they read a book then they lose their power can only read anran

381
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
If you're weird

382
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Mariscos

383
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
So Alex believes that

384
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
The AP

385
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Has reported

386
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
That the virus came from the Wuhan lab

387
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
They wish they end

388
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
The Danielle Anderson

389
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
Working the from the Wuhan lab

390
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,599
Is Banning stories from the AP that demonstrate

391
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,952
It's it's a whole mess but that's how Alex gets around forming

392
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Narrative

393
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
The Associated Press

394
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
Reported two days ago

395
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,120
New the virus came from the Wuhan lab

396
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
Knew it was weaponized

397
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Knew it was

398
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Spreading

399
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Flights from China

400
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
You're a xenophobe

401
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,832
Will not be allowed to be shared

402
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Platform

403
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
Anyone sharing the article

404
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Will be bad

405
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
He doesn't

406
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
Again this is just Alex misreporting the same AP story that suggested that the Chinese government knew that the virus was more serious

407
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,520
The situation then they admitted publicly for 6 days

408
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
Between January 14th of January 20th

409
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
The rest of the stuff relating to the Wuhan lab is it just stuff I like reading a Fox news headline he's trying to disguise it as an AP story

410
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
Because even he knows that AP stories are far more credible

411
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,184
Then Fox News Post citing Anonymous sources that are full of caveat like none of this is certain

412
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Absolutely

413
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,280
Alex wants the audience to think of the mainstream media is reporting on

414
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
On the same stuff used covering

415
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Because he knows

416
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
But even amongst the most strident

417
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Conspiracy theorist

418
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
Ignition that real journalist to do different work

419
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
And people like Alex

420
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
Is Alex says something maybe you'll believe it

421
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,640
But if the AP report something that you know they can back it up

422
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
This is a fascinating dichotomy of the paranoid

423
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Conspiracy world

424
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,088
They hate the mainstream media and yet constantly appeal to it to give themselves credibility

425
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
When they think they can

426
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Alex brother wants the audience

427
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
To think that this totally legit Outlet is reporting US News

428
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,840
And censorship has gotten so out of control that if you even post this AP story you'll get banned

429
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
This is the primary function of rewriting his own band

430
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Some social media platform

431
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:10,848
Because only the only kick them off cuz they knew we was right about all this stuff and even now the AP saying

432
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
None of this is real

433
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:18,528
Go to the ramblings of a liar circling the drain desperately flailing for anything to grab onto in hopes of saving the ship

434
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,856
They going to work media Outlets that reliance

435
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
Entirely upon expediency

436
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
Not good

437
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
No

438
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
No

439
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
But you know what's really funny

440
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
Trash

441
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
But Alex is so cocky about it

442
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
I really love

443
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:42,592
Like you really like is acting like a f****** nailed it

444
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
These people

445
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Science division runs

446
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
You can say about

447
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Vitamin D

448
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
Chloroquine

449
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
One of the top

450
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Real cocky

451
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Two scientist

452
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
At the woohoo

453
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
I don't know

454
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,856
She's one of the top Subs

455
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
I would need I would need further information on that

456
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
It looks like I forgot to cut out this clip

457
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,840
But Alex is also claiming one of his other big pieces of evidence

458
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
Is that the code

459
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Discoverer of HIV

460
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Has come out and said that

461
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,056
Alex is using headlines say that he saying this was definitely

462
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
100% made in a lab

463
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
And that's not

464
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
Like super activity list

465
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:59,904
Who is the coach cover of hiv-1 Nobel Prize in 2008

466
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,536
He came out when an interview and basically said that if there were HIV pieces inserted as the RNA of the virus

467
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,144
Then that would that would not have evolve naturally and it would require lab engineering

468
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,288
This is all good while but as far as I can tell no one is in any way demonstrated that there are hiv-positive been inserted into

469
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
To the Coronavirus

470
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,920
The only reference people can make on that is that unpure reviewtube retracted Indian study

471
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Which was seriously flawed

472
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,088
A follow-up paper published in February 2020 in the journal emerging microbes and infection

473
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
Look at these inserts that were said to be HIV and found

474
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,488
Quote all results demonstrated no evidence

475
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
The sequences of these for inserts

476
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
Are hiv-1 specific

477
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,984
Or the Northeast 2019-novel coronavirus virus has obtained these insurgents from

478
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
Hiv-1

479
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,872
First the result of the blast search of these motifs against gym bag shows the

480
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Top 100

481
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
Identical or highly homologous

482
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,320
Are all from host genes of mammalian insects bacterial and others

483
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,184
These other fees for inserts that are said in the Indian study to be hiv-related

484
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,488
Have a ton of other non-hiv sources

485
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Further these. These insertion

486
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,096
Are also present in multiple other Coronavirus

487
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,936
So the conclusions reached by the Indian paperwork definitely hasty

488
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
At least

489
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:22,080
So basically what you have there is Doctor Montage making an if-then state

490
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,176
If the virus has HIV sewn into it then it must have been done in the lab

491
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,480
That's probably fine but I just

492
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
Beauty if portion

493
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,368
In logic when you have an if-then statement and the premise is false

494
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
You can completely ignore the conclusion

495
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
It legitimately doesn't matter with the conclusion

496
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
Right because there's no truth

497
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,304
Reserved through the process of inference

498
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:47,424
Also this dude is theorize and got the lab in Wuhan was working on an HIV vaccine

499
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,288
And this leaked out which is not really in line with Alex's bio-weapon there it is but whatever

500
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
Alex will run with whatever he

501
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
Some credibility with the dumb s***

502
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Also

503
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,248
I don't think that Alex should be able to use these guys like

504
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,832
Guy who coached Stanford hiv-2 some kind of by proxy expert

505
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,648
Seeing as he doesn't believe HIV is real

506
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,696
Nor does he believe it is connected to 8

507
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,280
Kind of Festival leave that Luke Montage yay

508
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,840
Have to be in on the conspiracy right

509
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,400
I mean that's how you know he's telling the truth

510
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
Because he's lying

511
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,496
Can't have it both ways but I look really wants to

512
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,568
You can't trust this guy and John Rappaport

513
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Just Dance

514
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
You can't

515
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
I can't have it both way

516
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:34,272
The right-wing exist outside of both ways they have it always

517
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
All they do is hold us hostage with their lives

518
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:41,184
That's it

519
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
Important to point that out a little bit

520
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
So not only

521
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,120
Is this person who heads up the Wuhan lab

522
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
Track checking Facebook

523
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Friend

524
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Man

525
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
Fake Facebook is really

526
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
I got to say

527
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
If their staff

528
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
Might be a problem

529
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
The things that Alex is saying

530
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,832
German police that were worse than

531
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
Yeah

532
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Thousand of them

533
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
What

534
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
What

535
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
So

536
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,544
That's the wild year old dude

537
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,944
10080 year old dude working for Facebook so just be clear most of the people who'll be the right age

538
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Anastasio

539
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Pretty

540
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,928
I would imagine you'd be hard-pressed to find 10,000 Stasi members still alive today let alone 10011 where the kind of shape you

541
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
I need to be in to Riley modern

542
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Accompany

543
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,072
Inside haven't seen Lisa

544
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
What is enjoying

545
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Leaving aside how stupid that is

546
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,984
It's based on what you might call a colonel of

547
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
Something real

548
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
In 2050

549
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
Tienda Justice Ministry in Germany

550
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Established

551
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Task force

552
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,688
Look into online hate speech particularly directed towards Hemet

553
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:12,832
The goal was to get a sense of the scale of the problem which they would then use to encourage Facebook and Twitter to take the matter series

554
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
What are the groups that was included in this ngoie was an NGO called the Amadou Antonio

555
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Foundation

556
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:25,632
Named in memory of an angolan immigrant killed by neo-nazis briefly after the reunification

557
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Germany

558
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,984
The group's chairwoman is an etiquette on who is he

559
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
What you was a college student

560
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Burger Time

561
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
She was an unofficial informed

562
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
For the Stasi

563
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:40,736
I can't really defend that except to say that I see no indication that she's been dishonest about that part of her past

564
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,344
Incenta around 1982 what you stop being an informant her career

565
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Kind of speaks for itself

566
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:52,256
In September 2015 Paul Joseph Watson wrote a really misleading article about this task force

567
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,328
Tending to imply that is a body within Facebook

568
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,912
As opposed to a German HD studying the issue and able to advise Facebook

569
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,800
August Pohl credit that in the body of his article he does say that Kane was a informant

570
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
But I'm going to take that credit right back

571
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Because the headline quote extazy agent hired to censor xenophobic Facebook post

572
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
The informant

573
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,600
Recognition 1 Turnbull Road

574
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
Personally hired by. Yay

575
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,560
Anyway this is where Alex's Facebook is hiring the Stasi narrative comes from it was one person who doesn't work for Facebook

576
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,424
Has now been exaggerated into Facebook being run by 10,000 Stasi members they fired

577
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,056
Disguising amazing liar have to be pretty f****** dumb to buy things like this and he said I can't imagine

578
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Look

579
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
If you said like

580
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
Four former Stasi

581
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
Maybe maybe I'll be like

582
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
I mean that you and you don't have to be up with the modern technology you could direct things you could people could bring you stuff

583
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
Emails for you but 10,000

584
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Stasi

585
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,304
This is all really just

586
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,192
Probably an issue for Alex because Connie's advocacy is surrounding the rising right-wing

587
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,752
Extremism and their education towards immigrant

588
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Communities

589
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
And you know who makes money off that

590
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
Oh no I wait

591
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,456
Alex oh my God why would he choose her

592
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
Anime

593
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,064
Stasi deep-dish Facebook

594
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Great

595
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
Give me 5 News

596
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,256
Give me five star

597
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
But it's not just

598
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,352
These 10000 Stasi agent Facebook

599
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Security

600
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:50,272
I can legitimately find no articles on this that don't trace back to Infowars or prison

601
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
True so true

602
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Too true for the rest of the world even

603
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,816
According to a 2004 story that's now mysteriously gone from their website so it's still on the way back now

604
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,912
Machine Paul Joseph Watson Road about how political analyst named almartin

605
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,728
It alleged that Homeland Security and hired Marcus wolf

606
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
There's no

607
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,848
Substantiation of this claim in the article outside of this

608
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,248
Quote sources close to Martin have told Alex Jones confidentially that the appointment of wolf was also

609
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,088
Confirmed by us congressman

610
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,904
How many different levels of not

611
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
Talking to anybody that

612
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,768
That's a tell for me that this is b*******

613
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
Also Marcus wolf wasn't the head of the Stasi

614
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
He was ahead of the main directorate for reconnaissance

615
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
The foreign intelligence wing

616
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
The Stasi

617
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
A2000

618
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
For when this would have happened he was

619
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
81 years old

620
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
And I can find absolutely zero concrete evidence

621
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,640
It's that he was employed by US Navy

622
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
National Security

623
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
Or I mean you could say that

624
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,992
Right I tried to figure out who almartin

625
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
Since he's the only real source

626
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,648
But this traces back to and to say I was not surprised by what I found

627
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,488
He has a long-dormant website called almartin Draw

628
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Where he would write blog

629
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,608
But what interested me the most was that he wrote a book called quote

630
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
Shocking secrets of Iran Contra

631
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,312
Albert is yet another guy who's claimed he was in on Iran Contra

632
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,456
Look if you want to talk about that guy do you know who you guys hired to run the NRA what are you people talking about

633
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,504
This guy is also involved in Iran-Contra

634
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,904
80% of these ambitious right-wing type claim they were mixed up in a wrong contro it's kind of strains my ability to believe

635
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Most of them

636
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,048
To Martin's credit though he calls himself a quote fourth level player in the the affair

637
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,352
Whatever the f*** that mean

638
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
At least he's not like Iran it that Larry Nichols is like I was hanging out with

639
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:51,104
Either way I don't believe any of this until they can provide a little better evidence in this week's yet

640
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,944
Also just a small Point even if all of that is true that happened in 2000

641
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,344
For when there was not a democratic Administration in charge of Homeland Security and both houses of Congress were control

642
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
Go by the Republican Party

643
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,024
I've literally zero idea how the Democrats could have hired the head of the Stasi to be involved in Homeland Security.

644
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,328
Sweet gop-controlled of all the parts

645
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
The Federal

646
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:17,984
But I guess that's why Alex makes a big bucks he can imagine that

647
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,056
Through from the entire

648
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,872
World next order that f****** head of it

649
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,432
The Stasi whatever

650
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
Get away with that that might be the only thing they

651
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
They could sneak through with the right-wing running things in 2004 just like

652
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,880
Do you guys want to hire next agent for us to work with

653
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Hell yeah

654
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Yeah

655
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
So Alex

656
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:41,024
In his next Club he's he's talking about he's going to really get down to business

657
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Really get down

658
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,400
And as far as I can tell from listening to the rest of this episode the only thing

659
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,008
He has to get down to is more yelling about the Facebook censorship

660
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Checkers

661
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
Story seems to be the only thing he has to get down to

662
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Get down to business

663
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:02,528
All right now

664
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
Play it all out

665
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
Write a layout to the present

666
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,512
Add to the Pentagon everybody about the choices we all have to make right now

667
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
I know

668
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,960
Play it out as well to your husband your wife your neighbors your church

669
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,616
Ulster County the United States

670
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
Okay

671
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:39,392
Alright so I am anxiously awaiting him laying this all out I just got 10 pages of

672
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,792
Of all the stuff prepared notes has been working on this for years

673
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Sounds like I'm so f****** ready to do this

674
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
I'll do it later

675
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,448
Also by the way the you getting yelled at for not wearing a stupid f****** mask

676
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
You sell mask Dallas

677
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
Pick a lane

678
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
Galaxy S10

679
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
So anyway Alex

680
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Complains

681
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
About the Wuhan

682
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,856
How are the lab right there running the Facebook fact-checkers

683
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
Course and

684
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Steps to worry about life

685
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
Don't do something about

686
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
Still why

687
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:24,192
Wuhan bioweapons lab of the Chinese operatives running Facebook

688
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
Blocking

689
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,064
Is the president an incremental trance

690
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
I'm listening

691
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
What do you

692
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
You know what

693
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
You can't handle the truth

694
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,984
So yeah is its conclusion is the Trump pics if you can't handle the truth

695
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,360
I-90 we go back to him being poisoned with his Diet Cokes

696
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,408
Is there a woman that was fun

697
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Also like

698
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,712
I just don't get

699
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
Why you want to continue supporting a leader who you have to question if they're in a trance or evil

700
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,280
Like that doesn't seem like the sort of person you want to get the high

701
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:27,168
Is it possible for us to find a candidate from either party that couldn't have that question asked

702
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,032
It's a constant thing for Alex

703
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,152
You simultaneously always sure the Trump is the greatest and then also like I might be going to

704
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
Bobby going to kill us okay

705
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
So he's my guy

706
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,784
I want him to be an authoritarian leader

707
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
But at the same time

708
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,160
He's not doing anything that I want him to do which is why he's

709
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
He's my guy

710
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
So how is it that I

711
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,280
I can continue to support him if he doesn't do anything I wanted to do special

712
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
If I'm giving him all of this power

713
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Plan don't care

714
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
I'll just yell

715
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,008
So Alex gets into some like sort of virus

716
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
Conspiracies here and

717
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,408
He's really leaning towards I calling everything a scam and fraud

718
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Fraud

719
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
2080

720
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Not true

721
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:23,488
They're not counting anybody new in the last 2 months. Of the flu they always take

722
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,192
So he's just making things up there if you go to the cdc's website you can find plenty of information about the 2019 2020 floozies

723
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,312
And there were plenty of influenza related deaths that have happened that have not been double-counted

724
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
That is Coronavirus death

725
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
There's a little truth with our two saying though

726
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:46,784
It is true that as of April 4th the cdc's website will not be posting updated flu season burden

727
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,600
But that isn't because there's some kind of a cover-up

728
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Because flu season is mostly over

729
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
Any updates would be kind of irrelevant

730
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,864
States are continuing to collect their data which will be used to update or revise the cdc's numbers after the fact but given the flu season

731
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Has crested

732
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,936
The cdc's role in this is ended for now

733
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,264
Almost certainly Alex just a headline that the CDC was going

734
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,336
GameStop releasing revised estimates about the flu season sometime

735
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:15,712
After this April 4th data came out he's just completely unaware of what he's talking about or wilfully line

736
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:20,064
About it if you want to find out information about the flu season all you do is look for it

737
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
It's pretty

738
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Available

739
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
But I wasn't interested information

740
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:28,768
He wants to pretend that the coronavirus deaths are all secretly just flu deaths being passed off as something else of the globalist

741
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
Grab power

742
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,376
You should recognize that he if he's wrong about what he saying

743
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
Which is

744
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,752
He stamps be personally responsible for the deaths of people who look up to him as a voice

745
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Guidance

746
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
I really hope it is

747
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
Ready and prepared

748
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,128
To handle that kind of spiritual weight

749
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Cuz that is

750
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Going to be

751
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
Devastating

752
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,320
If you ever have to look in the mirror about that it would be devastating to

753
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Non-sag

754
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
I just don't think

755
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Man I just don't

756
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Think they have it you better be ready

757
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,280
For that to be a lifelong commitment psychopath that goes like

758
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
That's how you become the president

759
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
You ever

760
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,192
Have a Moment of clarity and it will destroy you

761
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
You know

762
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,288
If if it were possible for somebody like Trump we wouldn't

763
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,336
Be where we are but I could watch

764
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
People die in front of him and

765
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Not give a s***

766
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
I don't know if Alex is that

767
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
Purely psychosomatic

768
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
So Alex

769
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
Complaining about Bill Gates

770
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
Apparently Bill Gates Wants to Rule the World

771
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
To know that

772
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
Empower

773
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
Intelligence

774
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Sure why not

775
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
Knowing who the players are in

776
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Terror

777
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,712
Bill Gates

778
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:56,064
President of the world

779
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,464
So Alex has presented the Bill Gates wants

780
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
Take over the world

781
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Now

782
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
What

783
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
This next clip

784
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Part 2

785
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Pentagon

786
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Alex

787
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,544
Every move and how they operate what they're going to do next

788
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
About this

789
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Sounds like you are

790
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,576
Pentagon intelligence agencies in the White House

791
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
Because

792
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
We're not naive

793
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,512
So you got up this is the part 1 and part 2

794
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Part 1

795
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
Bill Gates going to try and take over the world

796
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
Park to the White House

797
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,168
The Pentagon there in all of Alec

798
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
That's interesting manually put those all together

799
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,056
Elsa's the middle of this weird rant about how evil

800
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,872
Vaccines are and how Bill Gates could take over the world

801
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
Nefarious vaccine

802
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Substandard Infowars bulshit

803
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,271
However this Rises to amazing comedy

804
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
When you talk about

805
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,879
Being in all of Alex's why doesn't

806
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,183
And that's because Trump say to this

807
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,327
In his coronavirus briefing on April 17th the same damn day is this episode

808
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Is today the FDA in

809
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
A new collaboration

810
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
The Gatesville

811
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Us cotton

812
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
To greatly expand

813
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
The supply of a sin

814
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Schwab's including

815
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Polyester

816
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
Q-tip types

817
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Schwab

818
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
For the

819
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
Coronavirus test

820
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
All of these acts

821
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
It will help us

822
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Incapability

823
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
Need to grow

824
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,815
Oh what's that Trump announcing a collaboration between the FDA The Gates Foundation helping

825
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,911
He's closer than doesn't sound like something a guy who thinks Bill Gates is evil demon

826
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,775
Set up to take over the world

827
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:57,407
Maybe he is in many ways I am also of Alex's dumb bulshit

828
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
Just because

829
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:03,295
It really does seem to never stop it just doesn't seem to stop at the

830
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Old Faithful

831
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
You make a good point

832
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,415
In all could be another value neutral statement

833
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Could meet a couple different things

834
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
So at this point Alex

835
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,583
Takes on another theme

836
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,911
Videos throughout the show that is like he's getting real close

837
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Stooges

838
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
Straight up advocating

839
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
Literal War

840
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,847
Is what I'm saying screw we have to go to war

841
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
People at the local level the international level

842
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
We're at War

843
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Chinese Chinese

844
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,303
Censorship in the US

845
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,735
They're expecting you to not seeing what this really is and deal with it

846
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
Only by full commitment

847
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,535
We can annihilate them now

848
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
So we're getting much

849
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
Closer to Alex

850
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:25,471
Directly you saying we've got to have a World War

851
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:31,871
But it's also a local War 2 it's a Civil War and World War simultaneously which

852
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:36,991
For that sucks you know what if I were reading 1984 as a how to Mandy

853
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
It suggests convincing everybody in a certain group

854
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:46,975
That they are constantly and eternally at war with everybody in another group

855
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
That's interesting

856
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:54,143
Sounds like Hillary break with this talk of like

857
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
If Trump comes out

858
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,543
And says the truth that I know if I'm right about this stuff then we're at War

859
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
By okay

860
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,847
You should be talking like

861
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Like this is

862
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,479
This is so irresponsible and comes back

863
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
A man he is just rambling

864
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:16,927
About how like I will be destroyed but by destruction will be the true destruction of my enemies

865
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Exactly how you

866
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
Blasphemy

867
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,607
Basically

868
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,935
Cornea

869
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
Everything

870
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
Things me Reborn

871
00:45:54,303 --> 00:46:00,447
Women friends

872
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:09,919
That's the good guy

873
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
You're right

874
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,583
World government

875
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,911
Year

876
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,471
Academy

877
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,519
And those it lots of stand against it

878
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,079
Discrimination will be

879
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
The temple

880
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,687
So blinded and tortured

881
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
Predicted Indiana.

882
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
He misses that music

883
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Yeah

884
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
That was really helping about

885
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:01,631
These are the times that try men's Souls

886
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
I can tell you at this point

887
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:10,591
I can't do the show anymore

888
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
Do you sort of overly a symphonic music

889
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,343
I don't have the backing music anymore I don't know I am not trying to be dramatic I can't do this anymore

890
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Alright man

891
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,439
Whatever I don't think a lot of movies have

892
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
The good guy give a speech over f******

893
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
Gotterdammerung there whatever

894
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,447
Meijer instruction will be their destruction I can

895
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,287
That's the guy I want to root for

896
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,895
I just love the swing there within like the span of a minute like this

897
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,479
I can feel the power and all that like

898
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,807
I haven't done this for a while

899
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,647
So Alex prays for focus

900
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,303
I will do my best but not like I wanted to

901
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,375
After I just pray to God the focus and Clarity to get it

902
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Just the facts

903
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,727
Just lay out the big dimensions of this

904
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:14,079
Without going into little my new show like I like to do to prove he's little factoid

905
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
But it is

906
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Untenable

907
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,599
Have the Communist Chinese

908
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,719
Officially given the run of the big five

909
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
Tech companies

910
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,327
People all over the world

911
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
Anyone off their platform

912
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,959
Going to go out and protest to reopen

913
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
I would

914
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,031
At this point if I were there

915
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
Name the five

916
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,151
Put a name down

917
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:53,503
Just right just close your eyes and say anything for five big

918
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,063
Maybe like Facebook Twitter Google

919
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:01,183
Is MySpace still a thing

920
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
AOL still going well

921
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,447
Anyway Alex tries to prove in this next clip the Chinese censorship

922
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Thanks

923
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,311
I will see that it is just the same story about dr. Danielle and

924
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,639
News confirmed

925
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Put out this info

926
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Whether it's Google

927
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
Weather is app

928
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
They have

929
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
Media Matters

930
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
No

931
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
They're giving way

932
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
To the Communist Chinese

933
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
The division

934
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
Armies of Chinese

935
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
I would

936
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,903
Pet brace that differently in public

937
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Checker

938
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
Wuhan bio lab

939
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
Ruled out viruses

940
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,615
They have their media other culture there

941
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,391
Kitsap so I want to clarify something in case it's not clear already

942
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,719
Dr. Anderson the person who's done some work at the Wuhan in

943
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,767
Urology is not employed by face

944
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:46,911
Dr. Anderson is not in charge of Facebook science whatever Alex imagines that is

945
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:53,823
As for the people who were trying to say their work at the Wuhan lab is somehow a conflict-of-interest again I have to stress that in her comments about the

946
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,871
Virus originated at that lab

947
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,919
She brings up the fact that you work there

948
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,735
He's very very transparent about it saying quote

949
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,575
I worked in this exact laboratory at various times over the past two years

950
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,927
I can personally attest to the strict control and containment measures implemented while working

951
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,231
The staff at wivere

952
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Incredibly competent

953
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Hard-working

954
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,303
An excellent scientist

955
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Supertracker

956
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,375
This doesn't work well for Alex

957
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,239
Does narrative because he needs this to be an instance of China being in charge of this internet censorship

958
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:26,591
Not just an instance of someone we're doing some work at the Wuhan lab being consulted

959
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:30,175
In an effort to assess the accuracy of an editorial column in the New York Post

960
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
And why does Alex desperately need that right now

961
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Superyacht

962
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,367
Owen and Rob do just got kicked off Twitter and you can't possibly accept it was a result

963
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,183
I'm trying to start a mass rally in the middle of a pandemic

964
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,767
It has to be because China secretly in charge of social media censoring

965
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
Thumper Lane

966
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Desperate

967
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,631
Yep also there about 2.5 billion Facebook users

968
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,703
Alex is off by about a billion but who gives a s***

969
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,311
Does Aniyah doesn't swing the other way to point five billion is still too many yeah it's a lot yet

970
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,103
Sunnyway bisturi just keep going

971
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,919
This is all he wants.

972
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Checker

973
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,063
Wuhan bio lab

974
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,855
Rule out virus leak

975
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
Wall

976
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,671
Debunking article

977
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,095
Run

978
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,287
What do you think the chant

979
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,663
So this is very very clearly Alex's number one story

980
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,223
He's hitting this thing so f****** hard I'm getting annoyed

981
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:40,319
However in this clip he claims that there's an Infowars article that somehow proves it

982
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
The doctor Anderson

983
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
The charge of Facebook science

984
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:45,695
So off I go to look that dumb article up

985
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,999
Direct me to articles up on Infowars about

986
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
The story

987
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,583
What is just a reposting of the story of adidon zerohedge

988
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,119
And the other is by Steve Watson

989
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:57,983
License really thought had quit or died

990
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,311
I'm very sad to see bulshit work

991
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
I thought he'd grown up

992
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,615
Maybe you got fired for

993
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,407
Is real estate job or something

994
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
I've good babe

995
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
All this information and Steve's article by Daniel Anderson is just ripped directly from the zerohedge article so it's it's barely even

996
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
In a new blog

997
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:21,023
Neither article in any way demonstrates a doctor Anderson is in charge of Facebook science fact-checking that's just completely made up

998
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
Even if you accept everything in these dubious sources

999
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:28,191
I think it what must be happening is that Alex doesn't read the realize that science

1000
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,239
Feedback is the name of the separate business

1001
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:35,103
Yeah he just thinks it's a department of feedback related to science within Facebook exactly

1002
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,407
That would explain at least part of the confusion

1003
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:44,063
But even that doesn't explain the assertion the doctor Anderson run science feedback that's just not true and his article on Infowars evening

1004
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
Include the link to science feedback website

1005
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,391
With the list there

1006
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,439
Which doesn't include dr. Anderson

1007
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
This article doesn't show any of this stuff

1008
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:56,095
Ignore does it show Kate's funding at none of its supported by the evidence that he's providing at all

1009
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,911
Alex presentas kind of information he has to either be

1010
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,447
Consciously making things up

1011
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:04,031
Reintroduce so little work that he just sees the word like science feedback

1012
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,079
It assumes that he knows the whole story

1013
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:10,687
Either way this is scary level of unpreparedness you showing as it relates to his clearly

1014
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Read story

1015
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:17,087
Yeah I could also see him just reading it and saying

1016
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,671
Science feedback and then just transposing is that is like science Facebook

1017
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,207
Yeah that works there that's fine

1018
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
Chirp

1019
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,047
It's always about the same people Alex

1020
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
Because you always

1021
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,471
Making about the same people just fitting the same people in two completely different things and saying that

1022
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
You look this makes sense

1023
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,799
Course you can make it always about

1024
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
About the same people

1025
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
Have you just make stuff up

1026
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,383
Is there a super easy

1027
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,991
So Alex gets on his next move and he seems to be hinting at some trouble

1028
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,063
There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes

1029
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
About right now

1030
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,439
Let's just say this

1031
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
The enemy knows

1032
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
But

1033
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,055
What the Pentagon right now

1034
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
That's why

1035
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,943
Will you be taken off the air at any time because they don't want the source information

1036
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
The president

1037
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
It's okay

1038
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
You know how things work

1039
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,319
No matter what happens to me

1040
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,855
You're going to continue on

1041
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
We know that the Bible attack

1042
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,743
America kill the economy

1043
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
Sir Alex's

1044
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:33,631
Deeply insinuating are things going on behind the scenes and he might be off the air anytime now

1045
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:34,911
So

1046
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
About that

1047
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,799
It came to my attention thanks to listener name Rashawn over the weekend

1048
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:46,175
That's Alex's a gigantic legal battle going on that we've not heard about at all

1049
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
When he was out of Studio over the past couple of days it seems like it might have had something to do with the FDA or possibly his

1050
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Is DUI

1051
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,671
But now they reviewed some court documents from Pacer

1052
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,719
I really think that there might be a completely

1053
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,511
Lee different hidden picture going on here

1054
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,095
Back in January 24th 2020

1055
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,167
Alex is ex-wife Kelly filed a petition in bankruptcy

1056
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Seacourt

1057
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,751
She was making a claim of involuntary bankruptcy

1058
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
And requesting relief under chapter 11

1059
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:17,151
Cleveland voluntary bankruptcy is one where a party who's owed money

1060
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,175
Can file a petition

1061
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,711
To get that money they're owed

1062
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,527
And if the party that owes the money can't pay it

1063
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
They can be forced

1064
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Bankruptcy

1065
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,855
Involuntarily to pay the debt

1066
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
According to court filings

1067
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,671
Things when they got divorced

1068
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
In 2015

1069
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
Alex testified that he could not afford

1070
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
To pay the money that you was awarded

1071
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
The divorce

1072
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,863
So he signed a real estate lien would promise Kelly

1073
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:42,239
A certain amount of money related to their shared property as well as 10% of the value of quote the businesses

1074
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,287
Who created during the Joneses marriage

1075
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,311
The state of Texas

1076
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,127
I'll just read to hear from the file

1077
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
Micheli put into court

1078
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:56,063
The note requires Alex Jones to make monthly payments to Kelly Jones in the amount of 43900

1079
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,879
$33 yeah

1080
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,511
When Alex Jones defaults in anyway the note may be accelerated by Kelly Jones

1081
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:11,423
It goes on to say that on June 28th 2019 Alex stated the quote he would not pay the entirety of the Jew

1082
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
July 2019 note

1083
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,519
And that he would not pay part of the August

1084
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
Cenote payment

1085
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,407
I can't possibly claim to know whether or not Kelly's claims are accurate but

1086
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,199
She's a legend in this filing

1087
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:27,807
But Alex defaulted on paying her for a promissory note in the amount of 700

1088
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,831
86000

1089
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
861 dollar

1090
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,695
I got to marry somebody I hate his rich

1091
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,279
That's what I got to do that's what I need to do for some context that the proxxon

1092
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:42,911
At least 30 2786 bottles of Alex's VSOP

1093
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
A lot of sales

1094
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Make that up

1095
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:49,823
So Alex naturally tried to get this case dismissed and a hearing was scheduled for March

1096
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:55,199
Interesting Lee March 11th was one of those days that Alex happened not to be in studio last month

1097
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,527
He hosted the first little bit of the show then Owen took over

1098
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,367
When we covered that the feeling was that he had just gotten the letter from the

1099
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:08,767
New York attorney general that is silver sailed and he just gotten DUI so it look like what was going on with the funeral

1100
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
These desperate sales pictures going on

1101
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
But maybe it was

1102
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,143
Nobody was really going on with it is

1103
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:18,239
Ex-wife is suing a 3/4 of a million-dollar uncut gems

1104
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:24,895
No it's Adam Sandler's most recent movie

1105
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
Is one non-stop guy going from

1106
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:33,855
Creditor the Creditor trying to handle all this money and move it around so we can finally pay everybody off but with his gambling

1107
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,903
He's trying to gamble his way back in

1108
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
Indoor about it the whole time

1109
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Constant like

1110
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:43,071
Not that it's so stressful to watch this movie because you like

1111
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,375
Just pay a bill and stop

1112
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,959
I got really stressed out not maybe not the same level but like look

1113
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,263
This stuff is really like

1114
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,567
Adding adding all of this bus

1115
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,383
FDA plus the AG plus has his

1116
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,223
Current of Santa Claus suits plus all of the other shifts like

1117
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
This dude is

1118
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:05,599
Racing around from one nightmare to another but this one might be the big one

1119
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,927
So he Alex left the show in Owens hands on March 11th

1120
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,207
And then they have this hearing

1121
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
But

1122
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
Prior to that

1123
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,583
On the night of March 9th Alex got arrested for his DUI

1124
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,447
And the next day Kelly filed an emergency restraining order on the grounds of child endangerment

1125
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,007
To get their children out of the clearly chaotic environment

1126
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
On March 11th Kelly filed an emergency

1127
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,871
Motion for clarification of the law

1128
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
Easy she's representing herself

1129
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,735
So she was requesting the court Informer if there was

1130
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,807
The conflict between the pending involuntary bankruptcy case

1131
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,111
It is emergency protective restraining order

1132
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,159
She was worried that the bankruptcy case would

1133
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,719
Would preclude her from being able to file the restraining order

1134
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:47,071
And in this motion for clarification she makes it very clear that if it would

1135
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,375
She would automatically dismiss the bankruptcy

1136
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,959
A document like that is a Real Testament to her priorities

1137
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,751
And it is horrible World of Alex

1138
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
We spend our time and

1139
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:59,359
I couldn't help but be a little bit move by the fact that you was willing to

1140
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:04,479
Completely dismissed if it meant that it would impede her ability to try and

1141
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Get her kids

1142
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,807
Into a safe environment kids are worth more than

1143
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Three-quarters of a million-dollar

1144
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
I mean it's such a low bar not to save it

1145
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,695
Dunno and not to impugn which

1146
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:20,095
Like her at all because of how many monsters we talked about life

1147
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,911
That means you're human

1148
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,959
March 11th they had their here

1149
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:29,567
And the court decided the Kelly's cases were not in conflict and she would not have to withdraw our bankruptcy

1150
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
In order to file the

1151
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Protective order

1152
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,175
The court also dismissed Alex's motion

1153
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
To dismiss the bank

1154
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
With the court

1155
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,039
Determining if there was a legitimate dispute

1156
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,343
They set a trial date of April 23rd

1157
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
2020

1158
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,439
This will be a quote evidentiary trial on the merits

1159
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
The involuntary petition

1160
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,535
Answer to terman whether to enter an order of relief

1161
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,071
Against the alleged debtor

1162
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
Alex

1163
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,887
Dismiss the involuntary petition

1164
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,191
Where to enter any other appropriate order

1165
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,031
I normally might have considered something like this to be an element of Alex

1166
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,103
His personal life which I generally are on the side of not covering

1167
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
Sent it involves his divorce

1168
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
And ultimately

1169
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,199
It's not about his worldview or rhetoric

1170
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,807
It's just a dispute about his payment or non-payment of money he owes his ex-wife

1171
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:15,391
But I'd like to explain a couple reasons why I decided to bring this up on the show

1172
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,791
In the past 6 months or so Alex has been way way more fatalistic on everything I've ever seen him before

1173
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:28,447
He's been finding himself talking about quitting and recognizing that the end might be near in ways that I don't find to be similar to other

1174
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,727
Breeds of his career that I've looked at

1175
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,567
Many of the things that he's dealing with could be what's driving that

1176
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,895
From his supplement warnings to his upcoming Sandy Hook trial

1177
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,223
There's a lot for him to worry about and a lot of various things that you could think

1178
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:40,991
Might be

1179
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,783
What he's worried will sink the ship

1180
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,879
I've considered all the Dynamics at play and I become fairly convinced

1181
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
What's this pending trial with his ex-wife

1182
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,231
In what's been motivating most of Alex's Behavior

1183
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Over the past

1184
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
Let me walk you through that reasoning

1185
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
According to her filing

1186
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,655
Blank the notification of non-payment from Alex

1187
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,959
Regarding the July and August no pay my

1188
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,983
Back in 2019

1189
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:06,335
You would assume the talk of filing a lawsuit over these defaulted payment

1190
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,615
Wouldn't happen to mediate

1191
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,895
You know that there's probably so

1192
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,919
Grace.

1193
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:13,247
Probably pretty good chance things were normal for a little while

1194
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:18,623
Early September 2019 is when we started to hear Alex repeatedly have breakdown

1195
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,207
What are you talkin about how enforced might not make it another year

1196
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,767
How we didn't know if he was going to reorder supplies

1197
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:30,655
Some of that definitely could have been about his need to sell out stock so he wouldn't have to pay taxes on carryover inventory

1198
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,935
But if you recall

1199
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,495
Do you talk to whole lot about selling his house

1200
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
This is interesting because

1201
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,127
The debt that Alex has to Kelly is secured by liens on two properties

1202
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
But it a hat

1203
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,991
Found to be in default of his debt one way could be paid

1204
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,295
Is by foreclosing on that property

1205
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,623
Alex knows what these houses are what is used to secure his death

1206
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
So he knew that he wasn't making payments

1207
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:56,511
It would stand to reason that he knew was only a matter of time until he lost his house

1208
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,863
January 24th was the day of the bankruptcy filing was made

1209
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,655
Another couple of interesting things

1210
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,447
Is it come from looking back at that show

1211
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
The first

1212
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
Is it Alex

1213
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,543
Start the show on time that day

1214
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
And when he did come to the mic

1215
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
This is how it started

1216
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
Reading all the news and all the information

1217
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
This is probably one of the first

1218
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
First times that

1219
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:20,575
I just physically could not go on air at start the broadcast

1220
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Add

1221
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,463
Just comes a time when

1222
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,303
The world just going to have to be judge

1223
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:36,447
He's another pretty f***** up headspace of Doom

1224
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,775
Very much projecting

1225
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,311
His own judgement

1226
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:47,711
Or later I'm going to have to be interesting Lee that was the episode where Mike Adams declared it over

1227
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,527
Over for Humanity

1228
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:54,111
That's less relevant to Alex's mental state because it was coming from Mike

1229
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,695
But will we pay less attention to about that episode in hindsight

1230
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:00,255
Is the other guest that was there that day

1231
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
Jon rappoport

1232
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:07,935
I've noticed that Alex doesn't really bring Jon rappoport around much these days except when he needs a bro

1233
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:13,055
I've long suspected the Rapoport is hypnotizing Alex but maybe it's a benign kind of

1234
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,639
We're talkin to Rapaport really does make Alex feel better

1235
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,967
Almost episode it really did deteriorate into

1236
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,551
Alex kind of needing some therapy from John about identity issues

1237
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,623
God is pretty well so how do you

1238
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,415
Yourself up to died

1239
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
But not the bad stuff

1240
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,071
Back to it I'm going to meet

1241
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
Aaron do it but the point is

1242
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,703
Be in that place the most of the David Dog Spa

1243
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
In the song

1244
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,031
How do people begin that Journey

1245
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,895
How do you do that

1246
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,295
Either you recognize that

1247
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Your

1248
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
You're an individual

1249
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,927
You're not existing by virtuous

1250
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
The fact

1251
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
People and so forth

1252
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,655
The source of your excuse

1253
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,471
Goldman Sachs you need you need you

1254
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
You need you

1255
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
There

1256
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:17,823
You're going to go on

1257
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,895
He's getting this for like real

1258
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
100% therapy

1259
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,415
The Rapaport to set him right about things

1260
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,951
And he was deeply

1261
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,767
Backed up about identity issues on this episode

1262
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,815
And of course that ends with one of my favorite

1263
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:43,423
John report you got to come on more than once every 6 months please come back on next week we love you

1264
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,031
No more fake news. Calm your beautiful till we love you John beloved on report thank you so much

1265
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,567
Thank you Alec

1266
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Thank you so much

1267
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,407
Hours Lowe's on Route 4

1268
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,735
So after this point Alex goes back to normal for a bit

1269
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:02,879
There aren't so many instances of him saying that everyone's going to die or the world is bound to be judged

1270
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:09,023
I think there wasn't any real reason for Alex to be too worried after the immediate situation

1271
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:12,863
Snow going to end did file his motion to dismiss the case

1272
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,167
Super baller been successfully kicked down the road

1273
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,263
For now it's normal as Infowars stuff and there's no

1274
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
The one thing though

1275
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,591
Is it theirs

1276
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:27,711
Dramatically increase sales pitches surrounding the food buckets and his silver

1277
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
Write that

1278
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
That is when

1279
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,807
Everything went

1280
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:41,279
At this point at this point he's engaging in the coronavirus as he might with any other sort of

1281
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,839
Completely made up and zero Stakes conspiracy

1282
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,375
That he engages

1283
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:49,215
On January 31st he's freaking himself out about Resident Evil me

1284
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,311
Give you some sense of how seriously things were being taken at that point

1285
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,871
Wild stuff is just info

1286
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,919
The coronavirus Meredith takes

1287
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,943
Kristin Turin

1288
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
In late February Alex gets

1289
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:04,319
Distracted by Rogers sentencing and then he launches into a full-on

1290
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
About going to see pack

1291
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,159
And associating with Nick Fuentes

1292
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,463
Kelly had until March 5th

1293
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
Defiler response to Alex's

1294
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
Petition

1295
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
So Alex

1296
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,583
Up till that point she doesn't file

1297
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,143
Assumes

1298
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
If she doesn't file on the 5th

1299
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,239
She end up filing on the 6th

1300
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:27,871
But it was still accepted by the court given the coronavirus situation making things

1301
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,687
So by March 6th Alex had a good reason

1302
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,759
Think this wasn't just going to magically go away and he knew that

1303
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,527
The hearing was on

1304
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
On for March 11

1305
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,367
On-air things are too different but on March 10th

1306
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,695
He doesn't show after a night in jail for a DUI

1307
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:46,559
On March 11th Alex only host the first part of the show for all and takes over

1308
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
If you work almost

1309
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,375
Depart Alex hosted

1310
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:53,983
What about his Vaso beets how they have nitric oxide in them which Alex thinks Is nitrous oxide

1311
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,543
Also this is the show that he ends his segment

1312
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,895
Of his I know what he's hosting before you leave by surprising everyone with free shipping

1313
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
What you swore he'd never do again

1314
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,015
Things get pretty complicated at this point because

1315
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
By March 12th

1316
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
Two things have happened

1317
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:12,415
One is that he's learned from this court that his motion to dismiss was reject

1318
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
And he'd have to go to bank

1319
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,487
The 2nd

1320
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:20,351
Is that he received the letter from the New York attorney general ordering him to cease and desist from the sales tactic

1321
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
He was using surrounding his silver

1322
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,471
March 13th on his show is a complete break

1323
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,543
He started talking about how we're all dead already

1324
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,591
He got really mad at callers you promised

1325
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,895
To hit himself on air if you didn't take enough calls

1326
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
He started rambling about how easy was to

1327
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
To kill other people

1328
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
And notable

1329
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,783
He ended the show predicting

1330
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,063
Imminent end

1331
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
Of his show

1332
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
I feel like I'm almost

1333
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,927
Also talk

1334
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,375
Megan bad about to happen

1335
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
Take a note

1336
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,727
Police officer Bryson

1337
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
Don't say that

1338
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,823
Let me know Matic I want to tell you I love you and I appreciate you

1339
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,359
But

1340
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,479
A lot of big stuff going down

1341
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,527
Maybe that's going to change

1342
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,135
But that Trump is said any minute to declare a national emergency

1343
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,695
What are declared three weeks ago

1344
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,743
There was no show on the 14

1345
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,023
Because it was a Saturday

1346
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,351
And Alex didn't do his show on March 15th 16th or 7th

1347
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:31,263
But by the time he got back the coronavirus situation that developed to the point where things were so crazy that it's legitimate

1348
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,591
Really impossible to discern what input is leading to what output for

1349
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:39,199
Since then we've seen Alex increasingly be unable to do his show

1350
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:44,575
He's left the show on a number of occasions he's descended into rants about how the public deserves to be exterminated

1351
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:50,463
He's gone out to break yelling things but I was listening to burn in hell only to come back from commercial and apologize

1352
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,255
There's something very serious up

1353
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,071
This case seems like a possible candidate for what it is

1354
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Yeah

1355
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,375
I could be entirely wrong

1356
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,423
Admit that entirely

1357
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,471
But I think that this timeline somewhat

1358
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,007
It suggests the large Secret

1359
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Contributor

1360
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,079
Dallas is complete inability to do his job

1361
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,895
Is frequent dalliances of the thoughts of impending doom

1362
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,431
It is notable recent absence

1363
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,479
This could be this bankruptcy case

1364
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,015
That he's doing court for

1365
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,551
This Thursday

1366
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
There's another reason I want

1367
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
To discuss this a little bit

1368
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,671
I have no idea how the case is going to shake out

1369
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:25,023
There's a real possibility that this week could end with Alex losing a massive settlement

1370
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,047
They could stay at the bank

1371
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:31,423
I would hate for that news to break and if it's been sitting on this information and not discuss

1372
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,519
At the same time it's entirely possible that the court will decide now it's his favorite

1373
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
Or the trial could go on longer than one hearing

1374
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,615
Or Alex could lose an appeal the decision

1375
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
I've no idea what's

1376
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,431
Going to happen but the more I look at the

1377
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
Timeline of this stuff

1378
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,759
The more I saw possible overlap

1379
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,575
Please don't just take this as a possible thing

1380
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,367
Definitely not something that I'm claiming it

1381
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
Is definitive

1382
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:57,535
Most of the things that you can see that lineup is being possibly Alex responding to things in this case

1383
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,327
Could easily be explained by others

1384
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,679
Like the New York attorney general's letter coming right at the same time that is motion 2

1385
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
Dismiss was rejected

1386
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
You kind of got so much

1387
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,847
Chaos going on in his life right now that it's almost pointless as an exercise trying to figure out what

1388
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,871
Contributes to what

1389
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,687
But I thought that we had some information about a case that

1390
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,967
To possibly recollect

1391
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
It's worth discussing

1392
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
Yeah also

1393
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,039
Small point

1394
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:23,135
My birthday is this Friday after Alex's trial

1395
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
The universe really wants

1396
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
Give me an amazing present

1397
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,767
Do what I want

1398
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,655
I think it's I think it's sad a little bit for Alex

1399
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
Because I don't think

1400
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
He's capable of that

1401
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,775
That Clarity that comes whenever everything is

1402
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:45,663
Like it seems like this has been my experience whatever you're not until it's too late

1403
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,735
Yeah yeah whatever I've been in a situation where it's like just

1404
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,271
One thing after another

1405
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,319
Everything pisses me off until it get

1406
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
Get to that point where I'm like

1407
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,439
This is just so bad I don't even I can't even feel

1408
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:01,535
I I can't even feel angry about this I just have perfect clarity of how I'm going to be

1409
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,583
You f***** and I just got to live through this

1410
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,119
Said he just cannot do that

1411
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,959
Maybe maybe maybe a fairy does

1412
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,007
I don't know it's impossible to

1413
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:17,407
Hotel because of that

1414
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:24,831
Smack dab in the middle of him realizing he has to go to court and the day he has his hearing

1415
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,367
Like it's so

1416
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
Right there it's

1417
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
It's really difficult though

1418
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
It's 88

1419
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,743
Almost impossible to say

1420
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,047
Anything but I've heard any

1421
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:38,399
Like real talk of this cake

1422
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,471
That does Veer too much into the personal which is like I don't

1423
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,031
I don't think we have any business covering

1424
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,335
So in this next clip

1425
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
Jordan

1426
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,479
Okay and Alex is talking about how you write

1427
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
About everything

1428
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,807
But because he's right about everything

1429
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,599
Temp won't save

1430
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,879
The same things

1431
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
Alex does because that means

1432
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
War

1433
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,023
People that created the virus

1434
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
Did the Pentagon keeps going we don't think it's man-made

1435
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,295
We don't think

1436
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
We got to go to war with him

1437
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
I understand

1438
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
That President Trump

1439
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
Keep forget

1440
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,143
Tucson

1441
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:54,943
He's saying that Trump needs to say the same things as him even though that means war and then in the middle of

1442
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,759
He's like my ear pieces and then I'm going to go up there

1443
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,599
How little does he care about the seriousness of the topics he's covering

1444
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
This is insane

1445
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,975
I'm just going to leave you with that little tidbit of I think we should be at war with

1446
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:13,375
With China I got to get off a real quick on air

1447
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
That's that's shocking

1448
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,007
So no more half-measure

1449
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:24,127
Playing games at half-measures polish

1450
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,687
Playing patty-cake with Ash

1451
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,159
So the old rules of being chicken necks

1452
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,975
Cowards is over

1453
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,535
Were you being mad

1454
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,655
Really bad and really crazy really

1455
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,983
I don't even talk about things that we can at least do

1456
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,567
If you don't have firearms and ammunition

1457
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
Uh-oh

1458
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
If you don't have water filtration

1459
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,479
You're insane you need high-quality water filtration

1460
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759
Lexapure

1461
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
But such as we have wrecked one

1462
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:13,023
Alex Alex knows damn well that alexapure water filters are not sold out

1463
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,327
Because they can never really be sold out

1464
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,631
Is it doesn't actually keep them in his Warehouse

1465
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,239
If you go to his website you'll immediately learned that he doesn't really sell likes

1466
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,007
Superior filters

1467
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,079
There a product that he sells through my Patriot Supply

1468
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
Survival food sponsor

1469
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,407
They also sell the Alexa Pur

1470
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,223
Alex doesn't handle by Patriot supplies ordered

1471
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,807
You said on many occasions that they take the orders directly from Alex's website

1472
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,111
And they go to my Patriot supplies for filaments

1473
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,903
Then they ship it from there

1474
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:46,047
Obviously this would be needed to sell any of the food buckets any kind of scale because no matter how big is space Alex

1475
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,655
Is renting You couldn't possibly afford Eva Warehouse big enough for both food and water filtration

1476
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,423
System

1477
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,471
This is spelled out on his website shipping

1478
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,751
Information

1479
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:58,847
To ensure quality and reduce costs this item shipped directly from the supplier

1480
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,663
If you purchase additional items they will be shipped separately

1481
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:09,087
In order for alexapure water filters to be sold out it must be true that my Patriot Supply itself is sold out of water

1482
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:13,183
Filters that case it makes no sense to say they're great just try and find them somewhere

1483
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Not real

1484
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:19,839
Is an involuntary reaction for Alex to say things are sold out Edward near sold out

1485
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,119
Because I create the perception

1486
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,423
An artificial scarcity in the listener's mine

1487
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:27,263
It's a pretty old-school manipulative sales tactic and what you know

1488
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,543
What you're selling isn't

1489
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Product

1490
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,639
It's the what you're selling is the fear that you might be unable to

1491
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,919
To get said product

1492
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,455
Don't you feel dumb then

1493
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:41,855
You're thinking about this Lexus this is a great car I don't know if you're not on the fence lights

1494
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,927
Dinner's already let me just tell you right now this one on the lot

1495
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
The last one we

1496
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,095
I have two people coming in later they already said they want they want to buy

1497
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,399
Look we might be able to get free shipping

1498
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,983
I said I would never give Reserve Bank Alexa's mobile

1499
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:04,639
Generally I don't believe Alex when he says things are sold at or near selling out but typically I can't really do anything to confirm or deny

1500
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Tonight is claim

1501
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,455
In this case it's a clear-cut in

1502
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
Santa biking

1503
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,271
Eli so we got a new water filter

1504
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,831
What

1505
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:18,719
I did go to the website I need to go to my favorites play they're still in stock

1506
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
Black horse

1507
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,535
But you got to get this food

1508
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,327
Right you got it we got to get the buckets

1509
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:27,167
Got to get the water filters in cuz you're going to need that food

1510
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
Time.

1511
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,263
F****** bug-out ago

1512
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,551
Because I don't

1513
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:47,135
Evacuating for the worst things I've ever felt terrible doing it

1514
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:53,535
The total collapse of its being taken off the air in possibility

1515
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,239
Never been more disgust

1516
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,591
I feel kind of selfish they got there

1517
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,223
For me because I'm out here in all this

1518
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
We may get our asses.

1519
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
You definitely want to get

1520
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,471
Future

1521
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,799
You want food that easily transportable and that you got ready to go

1522
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,127
There's not going to be any currency out there more valuable than food

1523
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,431
So get my food money

1524
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,015
This is pretty

1525
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,039
Do me

1526
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
Yeah

1527
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,855
Now let me let me follow his lodge

1528
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
Real quick

1529
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,207
There's no currency that will be more valuable than food

1530
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,511
Right so you should trade your money

1531
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
For my food

1532
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Haha

1533
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:04,447
But he doesn't actually have the food true true

1534
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:09,311
Occurrences

1535
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
Well the past you would have said gold

1536
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,687
Staking that now so

1537
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:20,319
No more hate the bottom is going to fall out at total societal collapse summer of rage, and get gold

1538
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
None of that anymore

1539
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
Greenspoint

1540
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
You got to get food

1541
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,975
Because of global Astor at war with us

1542
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,255
And food is the

1543
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,583
Global economic and cultural war against us

1544
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
Overhyped virus

1545
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,031
If you don't give them all the power all the control of your life you're the bad guy well

1546
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,823
Give yourself

1547
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Our

1548
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Your life

1549
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
Neurotic

1550
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,319
Supplement into the future

1551
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,599
Knowing its container

1552
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
It's ready

1553
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
Easily transferable

1554
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
If you got a bug

1555
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,279
Waterproof

1556
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,071
Do containers

1557
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,375
Write a boogie

1558
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
You say

1559
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,007
So Alex gets done with his dumb

1560
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:15,872
Very extended sales pitch and he wants to let you know that he's been dropped the ultimate

1561
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,640
Smoking Gun

1562
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,688
The China is doing

1563
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
This

1564
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:23,808
Censoring or something

1565
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
God

1566
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:29,184
If you can gets kicked off the air before doing that I'm be furious

1567
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:37,376
That's one of those like things like that sometimes they'll be storylines going in the WWE and then someone

1568
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,448
Gets fired and I never get the end of the story live

1569
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,728
Alex

1570
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,544
F****** stop doing the show without doing that surgery

1571
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,920
Amrish Puri I really don't want to have to say that Alex's show was canceled too soon

1572
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,456
So I

1573
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,480
Smoking Gun

1574
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,184
I'm going to lay this on the White House

1575
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,232
Warriors

1576
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
Everybody else

1577
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:11,680
Dramatic the only way out of this

1578
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:14,240
Leveling with the people is the only way out of this

1579
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032
Total War

1580
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,312
With globalist

1581
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
Chinese

1582
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
Who developed the virus

1583
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,200
Propaganda

1584
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,016
The TV shows the movies

1585
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
That literally spent

1586
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,136
Hundreds of millions of us tax

1587
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:31,904
Money

1588
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,352
Reprogrammed

1589
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,424
Town of the industrial world

1590
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,264
Bombers couldn't do

1591
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,056
Conventional munitions

1592
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,248
Prepare yourself for the ultimate smoking guy

1593
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,088
Smoking Gun is just in covering that story about the fact Checker again

1594
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,136
Is it really

1595
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:08,000
I want am I being prepared for that I've already prepared you guys already done a bunch

1596
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:14,400
It's like I've already eaten all the food I don't need I've already prepared for this

1597
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:18,496
Story story

1598
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,544
There's actually a couple of added element

1599
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,408
Details where Alex's

1600
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,432
Missing nuance

1601
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
When you look up dr. Danielle

1602
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,296
What do you find

1603
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
Us

1604
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,560
200 billion dollars

1605
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,936
Very loud that release date

1606
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,984
Develop a test kit

1607
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,032
Hahaha

1608
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
How convenient

1609
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,128
Fake laugh

1610
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,944
So we have two claims being made there primarily

1611
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:03,808
First is that doctor Anderson involved in the development of covid-19 test kits

1612
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,624
And the second is that you stand to make a ton of money from it

1613
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:11,488
Johns Hopkins Center for Health security as a list up on their website of all the tests

1614
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,304
For covid-19 that are currently used or are in

1615
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,352
And if you want we can take a look through all of them

1616
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:20,448
They're currently four tests that have been approved for Diagnostic use of the United States

1617
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,288
9 that have been approved for Diagnostic use in other countries but not here

1618
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,384
26 that are quote approved for research and surveillance purposes only

1619
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,944
And 11 more that are currently still undeveloped

1620
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,760
This alone should give you a pretty good sense that there is

1621
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,576
Really erase to make this test in order to Corner the mark

1622
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:41,696
There a lot of people working on a very similar gold no one's going to make 200 million dollars

1623
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,976
Pardon me

1624
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,560
People might make 200 million.

1625
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:54,240
That is not used in the United States was developed at the Wine LAB which is a part of the Duke and Us in Singapore

1626
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:58,336
This test is only used in Singapore and its for antibodies

1627
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,104
To the virus

1628
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,664
The test was developed by Professor Wang

1629
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,432
Linfa

1630
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,992
And so it took a while to find evidence

1631
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:05,760
This was the case

1632
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,296
It is actually true the doctor answers

1633
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,832
Did collaborate with him on it

1634
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,648
In a March interview with and US News

1635
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,184
Professor Wang said quote

1636
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,488
In my research with assistant professor Anderson

1637
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,304
We were are working towards making our serological test

1638
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:22,912
That's great so I guess this is kind of a half-truth being used to create a whole lot

1639
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:25,728
Dr. Anderson is involved in the development of a test at Duke

1640
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:31,360
And us but there is no reason to believe that she's motivated by profit so that she stands to make billions of it

1641
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,408
Wants to complain about that he should

1642
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,456
Start with celox or chembio

1643
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,248
Who are the two companies that don't test

1644
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,576
For two of the companies that don't test that are approved for use me and I

1645
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
Midstate

1646
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
0

1647
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,904
In terms of a conspiracy

1648
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,720
Her test is not even approved in the United

1649
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,768
Not just in Singapore cool

1650
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,792
Cool I'll

1651
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,816
Thanks for that

1652
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,864
Just because a man

1653
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
It's

1654
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,192
I'm good for her

1655
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,752
I'm glad she helped develop the test

1656
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,032
Something wrong with it

1657
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
What

1658
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:06,944
I'm not taking into account the fact that she f****** runs Facebook

1659
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,528
She runs Facebook who can say what

1660
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
But it turns out

1661
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
Says

1662
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
Call Bob's

1663
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,912
Covid-19

1664
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,192
Oh when did it do that

1665
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,384
Handle anybody studying they did

1666
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
You're all talk

1667
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,736
So that must be why they want Alex off here cuz no one

1668
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,808
Can handle the level of Truth and investigation he's bringing to the table

1669
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
The globalist

1670
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,160
Just have no rebuttal of this high-end truth coming out of the Infowars

1671
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
Shut it down

1672
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,792
First claimed he was a doctor Anderson runs Facebook's fact-checking would you've already disgusting

1673
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
Detailing it's not true

1674
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
The second claim is at this test

1675
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,960
She was involved in developing and Singapore words that designed to make people with colds

1676
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,984
Does positive

1677
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
Covid-19

1678
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,056
Actually really interest

1679
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,432
I mean obviously it's not true but impressive

1680
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:14,784
According to an article in these Straits times an English newspaper in Singapore

1681
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,088
The development of this test was actually very difficult

1682
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,392
For exactly the reason Alex's suggested

1683
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,440
Serology test

1684
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:24,000
That looks for antibodies against covid-19

1685
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,560
So it's important that they actually find the exact

1686
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,096
Antibodies

1687
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:28,864
Just kind of useless

1688
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:35,520
As it turns out Singapore is kind of the perfect place for that kind of thing to be developed primarily because the

1689
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,336
The country was hit hard by the sores outbreak in 2000

1690
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:42,432
30 there's a lot of people who have antibodies for SARS and their body there

1691
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,504
Stars and covid-19 are both Coronavirus

1692
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:49,600
And according to dr. Wang there Approximately 80% similar

1693
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,136
So the challenge he faced with

1694
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,440
Develop an antibody test that was so precise

1695
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:58,304
That it would bring up false positives if it was used on someone with antibodies for SARS end

1696
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
They came up with the

1697
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:02,912
Screening test is approximately 90% accurate in this very quick

1698
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,216
As well as a quote gold standard

1699
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,800
It takes four to five days and a level 3 biohazard lab

1700
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
What is supposedly

1701
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,592
Completely accurate

1702
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,896
What's important here is that the test

1703
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,968
Developed in Singapore is actually the worst possible example Alex

1704
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,272
To come up with when he's randomly trying to accuse people

1705
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:21,600
A creating a test that will just call any cold covid-19

1706
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:27,488
The team of researchers set out from the jump with the awareness that they would have to create a test that doesn't create false positive

1707
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,536
For very similar antibodies

1708
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
Achieved

1709
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,864
Anyway no one

1710
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,400
The imaginary globalist

1711
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:37,984
Least of all are worried about the alleged truth that Alex is spreading on air

1712
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:44,640
I think people want him off here because he's an unstable narcissist who seems to be drifting deeper and deeper into calling for a simultaneous

1713
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,920
Simple and Cold War

1714
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,480
Seriously right when his own personal life is falling apart

1715
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:52,320
That's someone who leaving politics aside should not be on there

1716
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,112
Is only the danger

1717
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:59,488
It is it is like he correctly identified the problem and then just assumed it was insurmountable

1718
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:04,608
Yeah of course it would provide false positives because

1719
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,168
Okay

1720
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:10,496
That is a good start and smart people

1721
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
Caught that before you

1722
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:15,872
Right that's why no one's afraid of you thought somebody had it first

1723
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:19,968
Is Buddy common cold is less similar to covid-19 and stars

1724
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:23,296
And if they're considering a purpose

1725
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,344
It terms of this test which again is

1726
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,880
Globally used

1727
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:33,280
I don't know I don't know what Alex is trying to prove here but it's all bulshit

1728
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,328
The episode Alex was complaining about

1729
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:38,656
Parents children being told to like

1730
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,680
Confront their parents

1731
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,216
It's about misinformation

1732
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,544
And he doesn't really get around to explaining what that story is

1733
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,824
About until later

1734
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,384
We get into that and man holy

1735
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
F****** s***

1736
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
This balls off of

1737
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,040
From Australia

1738
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,832
Canada

1739
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:57,856
They are

1740
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,160
Are calling for people to get their parents

1741
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
Home

1742
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,328
First.

1743
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,376
Porsche 930

1744
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,704
Does your dad

1745
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,008
Wuhan lab

1746
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,568
Getting his face

1747
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,616
Definitively

1748
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,480
Danielle Anderson

1749
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,512
Charizard covid-19 to create Hysteria

1750
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,536
These people

1751
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,864
Ridiculously obvious and stupid

1752
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:47,776
First thing I would say is this name has never come up on Alex's show before it gets she seems to be the

1753
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:50,592
You master over all areas of

1754
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,384
So baby that's

1755
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:58,784
That baby that should be a red flag he's behind George Soros did you know that

1756
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,088
After now you know how evil she is she has a

1757
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:07,232
Degree how do you f*** this up

1758
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,000
Never

1759
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,280
Exactly

1760
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:15,680
Another obvious problem with a narrative that Alex is selling here at least as far as the US goes is that most schools in

1761
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
The country are closed

1762
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,008
So there's no class where they be playing these videos

1763
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
For kids

1764
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,848
I'm not sure how elementary schools operate like

1765
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,176
Except for outside like my experience they don't have periods

1766
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:30,016
For older students like in junior high and High School

1767
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,552
But I have no idea I haven't been

1768
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,576
School in a long time

1769
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:37,696
So this video isn't something to play for kids at school it's a news piece that the Canadian broadcast

1770
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:41,792
The company did about the uncomfortable situation that a lot of people find themselves in

1771
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,328
Where someone in a group chat

1772
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,888
Possibly a family member is spouting insane

1773
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,912
Conspiracy theories

1774
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
The pieces basically just

1775
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,008
Explaining that your instinct might be to call them crazy

1776
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:54,592
But that kind of Shame and behavior will often just reinforce the belief the person

1777
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,920
Previously had as a defense mechanism to deal with the embarrassment

1778
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,944
To being called out

1779
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,736
They recommend inclusive

1780
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:05,600
Empathic language like reminding the person We're All in This Together

1781
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,928
It doesn't recommend anyone you use the resource

1782
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,720
Put out by Danielle Anderson door doesn't

1783
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:11,744
Dimension Health feedback

1784
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,816
They just suggest sending them a good link to a real source

1785
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:20,960
Good sources we are well past the point where his point makes any sense

1786
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:24,032
He was actually referencing my video where I

1787
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,080
Gave examples such as like I

1788
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
Listen up Mom

1789
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,408
If that is your real name

1790
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
You're wrong about everything

1791
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,480
And also

1792
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:40,672
As it turns out I have dinner later is not as concerned with confronting mom's as he is about

1793
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,256
Disputing a real Attack on Dad

1794
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,304
Is

1795
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,096
Pretty f*****-up

1796
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,120
Pretty f*****

1797
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:52,192
He starts trying to play the video and he can't

1798
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:52,960
Control himself

1799
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,496

Bulldog

1808
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
Sounded a little person

1809
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:45,952
That sounded a little personal I would leave it alone

1810
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,256
Map Thailand

1811
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,792
Yeah

1812
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,584
He says

1813
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
Mike alright maybe he'll get

1814
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,448
Further into it this time

1815
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:01,824
So what do you do when this happens a loved one

1816
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:08,992
Dropped into the family group chat with something

1817
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,272
What's barbacoa

1818
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,672
It sounds personal dad

1819
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
No

1820
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:36,384
Listen to your daddy

1821
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:45,856
It's definitely feels like he's working through some things

1822
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
Personal going on

1823
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:53,536
Vicky has a great relationship with the women in his life currently doesn't seem like it

1824
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,352
Third time could you do that

1825
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,984
So what do you do when this happens a loved one it's your dad

1826
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,008
Dropsy

1827
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,568
It's something

1828
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:08,384
Is Real China

1829
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
Foolproof

1830
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,584
I know this is how many times

1831
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,704
He makes a little bit further the next time

1832
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,496
I mean

1833
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:39,616
It did say it seems like he's really hinging on that bad thing

1834
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,176
211

1835
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:48,832
Maybe it's about the HR Director at 7 floors

1836
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,648
F***** up trying to express

1837
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Legos

1838
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,976
Break yelling about dads Maple Place

1839
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,536
Catherine

1840
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,072
Just staying home

1841
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,912
Chinese love you

1842
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,984
Dad

1843
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:30,048
Admittedly that is the type

1844
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,096
A behavior that would get a dog neutered

1845
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,984
Yeah

1846
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,008
I don't really have much of

1847
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:44,896
Comment

1848
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:54,368
Like it's a logical it's not it's not using the source material to provide,

1849
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,904
Commentary it's not

1850
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,208
It's not really even

1851
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,488
Expressing

1852
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,512
Appoint

1853
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,560
It's just lashing out

1854
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,864
Angry it's just responsive anger

1855
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,888
It seems to

1856
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:12,288
All circle around the idea of listening to Dad

1857
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:18,688
About somebody's children not listening to Dad that seems really important to have right now for some

1858
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,736
Very weird

1859
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
Yep

1860
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,784
So

1861
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,832
He goes to break and he comes back

1862
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:29,184
And I guess maybe because of some of those issues he needs a proxy son

1863
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,512
So brings Owen Shroyer into Studio

1864
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,280
Cars

1865
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,864
Straight up calling

1866
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,400
War with China

1867
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,448
Play be honest

1868
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,752
The disc came out of a lab and was man-made

1869
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,800
Then you could actually say okay you know what hey

1870
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:51,200
Hey we got a serious situation here this biological warfare launch against by the Chinese we need this to phase out we're going need a month we're going after

1871
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:54,784
Do some serious social distancing

1872
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,088
Blaming our speech when it's

1873
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,416
Is the government

1874
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,536
The president now

1875
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,584
It's totally out of control

1876
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,424
And I'm not going to try to

1877
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,496
Any other reason out

1878
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,672
I mean I'm sick of that

1879
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,488
Why is Alex saying that like

1880
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:39,840
Trying to fight over like bumping into somebody is a good impulse

1881
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:46,496
It's not I don't think so I think that it is

1882
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,520
Do I go to war with China

1883
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,568
Which is not good

1884
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,336
Nobody

1885
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,616
Even listening to death

1886
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:56,224
I needed somebody to listen to Dad so bad

1887
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,016
Thank you

1888
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,576
So they they start discussing how like we're almost

1889
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,112
In a nuclear war

1890
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,696
Nuclear war right now

1891
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,816
I don't know what the presents waiting on you this point

1892
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,864
Reality

1893
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
Man man oh man

1894
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,704
Hope no one's listening to this

1895
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
So Alex and Owen

1896
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,312
They're goof they do a lot of Goofy

1897
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,616
On this this interview

1898
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,896
If you want to call it that

1899
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,040
Comedy segment in impression I think of like a Rothschild

1900
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:31,808
This is

1901
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,624
Where I kind of felt like maybe he's drunk

1902
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:41,024
But I think maybe not I think he just got like really emotionally overloaded and now he needs Owen to like f*****

1903
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,888
Around what's going on

1904
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
But him being drunk

1905
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,936
And this is the price

1906
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:54,848
Rothschild like the old Rothschild royalty their kind of losing control Bill Gates

1907
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Central Bank

1908
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:16,352
You had

1909
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,472
Forget about you

1910
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:24,544
I didn't say this is great

1911
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,552
So we got

1912
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,960
Putting out Chinese prop

1913
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:55,776
Propaganda in the United States

1914
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,336
Facebook run by the Wuhan

1915
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,640
Okay

1916
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:07,040
So I mean like it's not it's not there like Telltale drunk sign or some little thing

1917
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,344
Things like the constantly interrupting then start

1918
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,464
Happens when he's drunk but I think it also happens when he's sober.

1919
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,048
Inconclusive on the side of sober

1920
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:24,448
I think he's out of his mind

1921
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,216
Coaches be like

1922
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,496
Like that

1923
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,288
Damn

1924
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:30,080
So they get around to like

1925
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,384
They're doing this s*** that's like f****** around

1926
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
Adnan Sen

1927
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:39,552
These weird impression total nuclear war

1928
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:45,184
Another jump back and forth because it in the snakes that they're talking about how like we could end this and that

1929
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,720
3 hours

1930
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,768
Leadership these guys are awesome

1931
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:52,096
Literally

1932
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:54,656
Capitec people on 3 hours in the military

1933
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:07,968
Yeah brother

1934
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,248
They're attacking us

1935
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,784
You lost for violence

1936
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,856
To an insane degree and

1937
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
Lying about

1938
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,904
Your bloodlust

1939
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,928
Is terrifier

1940
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:22,816
3 hours of taking out the leadership involved have to overthrow China

1941
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,864
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1942
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:30,752
Do you have to take out all of the globalist which are pretty much everybody

1943
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,032
The entirety

1944
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,056
All of big Tech

1945
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:39,712
How the healthcare system in the country

1946
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:44,576
Yeah I already said Democrats

1947
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:51,744
Stupid f****** idea you've got using an assassin

1948
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
Is it a

1949
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,816
Small if it one person

1950
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:59,680
You know easy for one person to get into places if you're using 1,000 1,000

1951
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,960
Somebody's going to get

1952
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
Get tipped off

1953
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:08,896
Does he really think that 1,000 assassins could take out the 10,000 Stasi that run Facebook

1954
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:13,248
CR old so maybe it would work

1955
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:18,624
So and of course is there to complain

1956
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,904
That's true

1957
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:24,768
Owens are mostly to complain about the fact that he got kicked off Twitter floors

1958
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,048
Score and it's B

1959
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:29,632
You know courses because he was trying to do this rally right

1960
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,192
Interesting Lee tries to

1961
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,240
Compare his own rally to those of

1962
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:40,640
Civil Rights era people problems

1963
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
You don't like black

1964
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:53,696
Whatever

1965
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,792
Literally everything stop

1966
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,656
Breathing actually

1967
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:17,760
I tell you what I really think even if it ends up hurting

1968
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:21,600
Maybe they're f****** around

1969
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,672
Tell me there's some problems with the with the

1970
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
Comparison

1971
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,208
Like what

1972
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,840
My head I would just start with like racism not being contagious

1973
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,376
Well

1974
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,936
If you listen to Alex it might be

1975
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:42,080
I would also suggest that possibly during the Civil Rights era were there

1976
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,872
A gigantic outbreak

1977
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:50,016
Why so much about the black community some of those protests to might have been put

1978
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,320
They would have still happen

1979
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:57,952
Maybe a little later probably civil rights as one of the most important things

1980
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,256
That you could possibly add to pay for

1981
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,792
Protest in favor of

1982
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:08,192
Still think you might want to hold off a tiny bit if your hair is

1983
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:14,080
Counterfactual I can't say for sure that that is what would have happened

1984
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:16,128
Yeah I would I would hope that

1985
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,200
Martin Luther King Jr wouldn't be like

1986
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:27,136
Well we've been being f***** over and murdered by the white oppressors for our entire life

1987
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:30,976
Lives in the entire lives of our families and back and back and back so I

1988
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:33,280
I think it's a good idea for all of us to get

1989
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:37,632
Together and wipe out two to three percent of us at the same time

1990
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,168
Second difference

1991
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,984
His whole thing is meaning

1992
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,800
And there's no point to Dem doing what they're doing

1993
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:51,456
The other big difference

1994
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:56,064
Perhaps in the next clip though I should say it

1995
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:00,672
No end of that last one owns their f****** around it's saying like hey if we stop breathing

1996
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:03,488
Don't spread the virus

1997
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,512
Well

1998
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,048
It turns out this becomes

1999
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,144
I'm just going to stop

2000
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,704
Because I want to be a leader I want to stop at

2001
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,288
Madonna

2002
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:18,336
Okay

2003
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:26,016
We do have a sandwich alarm titled Ipswich by placing music onto the certain stations get mad

2004
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,064
Like he would get at a funeral

2005
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:41,632
Around about this I thought the headline like

2006
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:45,216
Breathing breathing

2007
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
Goodbye

2008
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,640
Go to bet you can't take that away from

2009
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Goodbye

2010
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,688
Well-executed welcome

2011
01:45:54,944 --> 01:46:01,088
Can see you when I'm done caring

2012
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,392
Go for it at that goes on a bit longer

2013
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:09,792
People dying from covid-19 and then go outside and have a big rally with all kinds of

2014
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,560
People around

2015
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,376
Go to it

2016
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,400
Fun

2017
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,216
So it is night scope they talk about the

2018
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,776
Twitter and they have

2019
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,312
Three primary complaint

2020
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,104
About it or Alex does

2021
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,664
And all of them are dumb

2022
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,992
Coronavirus

2023
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,088
It's not about coronavirus

2024
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,768
Organized a protest

2025
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,096
Assembly

2026
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120
All your BS

2027
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,144
Doesn't

2028
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,472
The president

2029
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,104
I apologize three complaints are in a later clip this is just

2030
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
First complaint

2031
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,664
Is the right of assembly

2032
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,200
Obligation

2033
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,504
Protect Alex are Owens right to assemble somewhere

2034
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,552
The first amendment is about what the government

2035
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,832
Can and cannot do

2036
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:07,392
The government can't stop free assembly that's

2037
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,672
That's the rule

2038
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:13,280
Twitter can suspend people for trying to put together huge gatherings in the middle of a pandemic that's

2039
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,560
Totally within their rights

2040
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:19,168
I guess what these rallies over the weekend went off mostly without a hitch

2041
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:24,800
Because the government didn't infringe on people's right to assemble as completely f***** up and stupid have an ideas it was

2042
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:31,200
Yeah I can find one story about a person in Raleigh who is arrested at a protest in this introduces an important

2043
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:34,784
The right to congregate or assemble is not absolute

2044
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:38,880
For instance if you're breaking a different law to protest still be arrested

2045
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,672
Like an anti-war dim

2046
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,488
You can be arrested for assault

2047
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,768
This happens all the time

2048
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:48,608
Assembled my fist to their face buddy that is legal

2049
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:54,496
Right to free assembly common things like left-wing protesters

2050
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
If you talk to him

2051
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,568
Protesters are arrested for trespassing

2052
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,360
All the time

2053
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:05,504
This is one of the fundamental realities people and activist communities are well aware of and it's part of the price of doing protest

2054
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,040
In the context of

2055
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:13,440
Declared emergency like the one we're in now state governments do have the ability to do things they might not have had the ability to do and

2056
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
Another circumstances

2057
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:18,048
When there's a stay-at-home order in place from the governor the police

2058
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,840
Can't arrest people who are protesting

2059
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:22,144
Not because of the assembly but because the ACT

2060
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,960
Being assembled as a breach of another legal order

2061
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:29,824
So a lot of this was very state-by-state but generally speaking you can still go protest

2062
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,848
But if you do

2063
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,896
You very well might get arrested

2064
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:35,200
Your first amendment rights are still intact

2065
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,016
But exercising them in a way that jeopardizes Community Health

2066
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,576
Could run the risk of getting you arrested

2067
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,136
It's not ideal but it's also not tyranny

2068
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:45,440
What that is so exemplary of

2069
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
Is

2070
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,536
The difference between right-wing and left-wing protest

2071
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,584
Right-wing protesters

2072
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,400
Are so used to never being bothered

2073
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:56,192
And left-wing protesters alike

2074
01:48:56,448 --> 01:49:02,336
Big kick us in the face every f****** time we're going to jail all the time they're trying to murder us did you guys not know the

2075
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,128
The cops are patches and right-wing protester

2076
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:06,944
You guys are letting us hang out

2077
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:09,504
Oh no

2078
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,552
Could anybody who's

2079
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,600
Been involved in any of these sorts of things

2080
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,392
Know that you get arrested a bit

2081
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,928
Like it's just something that

2082
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,768
All the pictures you see if people would human

2083
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,048
Chains and staff

2084
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:25,120
It's kind of a part of the bed

2085
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:28,192
And I they just can't handle the idea of getting

2086
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,216
Suspended

2087
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:29,984
Twitter

2088
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,544
Cool

2089
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:36,128
So Alex now comes back from break

2090
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,176
And he does another comedy

2091
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,736
I got to say

2092
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:41,760
Really good

2093
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,552
Really well conceived

2094
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,320
Well EX

2095
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,088
Executed

2096
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
Goodbye

2097
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:52,512
You know around here earlier your back live

2098
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:55,840
Terrible things about the globalist

2099
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,680
Then he finally got reason

2100
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:02,752
He said it's time for all of us to die

2101
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,848
To stop covid-19 spread

2102
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,664
I don't just believe we shall be given masks

2103
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:14,528
Grocery stores

2104
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,576
You can put on Twitter

2105
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,112
Promoted

2106
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,184
Ourself

2107
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,488
Like they said they're killing people so

2108
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:27,328
Ramona Lane

2109
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,376
Eugene ding dong

2110
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:34,496
Is here

2111
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,312
Escalade

2112
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,360
Actually I represent

2113
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,664
The future babies

2114
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,688
Planet

2115
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,224
In the world

2116
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,760
Sewing his comeback

2117
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:49,344
With a plastic baby mask over his face which is

2118
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,904
Sort of blocking his ability to be heard

2119
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:58,048
Clearlake do you mean the things that he's supposed to be doing

2120
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:01,120
A comes back as a baby or something Alex says

2121
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:06,496
Jinping spirit animal of the commercial break their sort of work

2122
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,776
Tina cross-purposes

2123
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:12,384
They don't really have a good yes and that is Owen has just

2124
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,664
Invalidated

2125
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,456
The premise that Alex is established

2126
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:21,856
That's good I'm not the thing you said

2127
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:26,464
Is the best form of improv in terms of the game

2128
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,744
And that is that

2129
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,352
This baby is there to kill Alex Alex

2130
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,120
To kill him

2131
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:36,448
Will you kill me right now so I don't

2132
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,472
I just want to say

2133
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,752
This is an example of

2134
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,288
And the future of the world

2135
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:41,824
The Democrats

2136
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,128
Really care about the future babies instead

2137
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
We've been sent Alex

2138
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,456
Come here and to kill all humans

2139
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,528
So that we can save the human race in human volunteers

2140
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:55,136
Waterstones has volunteered as tribute he will be the first down

2141
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:57,184
You really exist

2142
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,232
I'll be uploaded live forever

2143
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:01,536
Of course

2144
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:07,936
Great improv there that I'm not actually going to be killed

2145
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:10,752
Oh yes of course that's what my plan

2146
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:14,336
God this is so bad problem with

2147
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,872
Getting good at comedy

2148
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:18,432
Part of getting good at comedy is making it seem like

2149
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,456
You're not working

2150
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:24,576
That hard people who don't realize that you have to work insanely hard to get there

2151
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:29,696
Think it's easy and you can just do it anytime you want we'll something that I thought was really interesting when I was

2152
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,512
I went and watched it was like

2153
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,840
There have to be some people

2154
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,888
Probably not a ton

2155
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,680
But some people who are like

2156
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,448
This is

2157
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,240
Hilarious

2158
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
Not real

2159
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:49,408
I mean there's got to be some people think it's like innovative

2160
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:55,552
Can't believe Owens wearing a baby

2161
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:58,368
Baby Owen kills Alex on air

2162
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:04,512
You're a real hero

2163
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,584
Oh yes

2164
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,888
Red Palace

2165
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,656
Good

2166
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,960
Good good ass

2167
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:15,008
So ladies and gentlemen as you can

2168
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:18,080
This is the future of mankind

2169
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,920
This is the only future if you want the teacher babies of the world to live

2170
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,456
Listen to Bill Gates

2171
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,504
Ben take your loving back scene

2172
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:26,528
And just die

2173
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,088
Dinosaurs and humans

2174
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,112
Give me forever

2175
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,392
Until then

2176
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:37,792
Now Alex Jones digital hologram rises from the dead

2177
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:42,144
So wonderful

2178
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:47,776
This is

2179
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,824
This is this goes on too long

2180
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,616
It's me Andre

2181
01:53:54,176 --> 01:54:00,320
Anyway I wish I could say I hadn't seen anything like that at a community theater before but how we going to do

2182
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,856
Really fun for me about this

2183
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,904
Is that Alex now gives up on the bed

2184
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,976
Brighten the middle of it and still trying to go through

2185
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:10,304
Keep moving forward and Alex's look like f*** it I'm done

2186
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,864
But I think secretly what's going on

2187
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:19,264
Is it Alex is jealous that Owens wearing the mask and is the center of attention that's what I think is going

2188
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,032
That sounds right

2189
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:23,360
American

2190
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,944
Images willingly die

2191
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:33,344
Don't worry we'll put your car into the system for

2192
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,928
You're an imposter

2193
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:43,072
Breaking the fourth wall

2194
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:47,424
Siam

2195
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:55,616
He's putting the baby

2196
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,992
Hello

2197
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,296
Love you

2198
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:07,904
Alex I think was jealous of Owen getting to have the fun of wearing a mask

2199
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,720
That what that reminds me so much of is

2200
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,304
Chicago comic who will not be named

2201
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,144
Wildwood show what show

2202
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:22,496
Just he was headlining your bottom so bad for like 4 minutes that he just left

2203
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:27,360
And then the hosts came back on I believe this was Matt drefke

2204
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,640
Started doing well

2205
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:35,296
And then he came back on and he kicked back dressy off to drag her this is him being like it's not my fault

2206
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:41,184
I wasn't getting the labs it's cuz of that guy where the baby man

2207
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,744
And then wants to get right back into two

2208
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:46,304
I want the ball yeah exactly

2209
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:50,144
And get back to Owen's Twitter

2210
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,448
Situation in this is where the three

2211
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,264
When I learned last night

2212
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:58,080
That you had a bunch of other crew members were banned off Twitter

2213
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:01,408
Because you're going to violate social distancing

2214
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:06,272
Process

2215
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
Platform Act

2216
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,256
Symbol

2217
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,328
The First Amendment

2218
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,032
Calling Owen getting

2219
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:31,616
Suspended from Twitter a war crime might be a little overly dramatic

2220
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:32,384
I thought

2221
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
Calling him

2222
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:36,224
Civil rights leader was overly dramatic

2223
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,296
It's actually a nice

2224
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:44,672
That kind of talk hurts a person's credibility but to be fair Alex doesn't have much to begin with so he's probably fine

2225
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:49,536
Alex has three complaints about Owen suspension seat to come down to the issue of 1st Amendment

2226
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:52,352
Due process and the question of off-platform activity

2227
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,400
These are all bulshit complain

2228
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:58,752
As an issue the First Amendment doesn't apply here so I just reject that as an argument

2229
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:02,848
Do process what rights of due process does Owen have with

2230
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,384
Twitter that are being violated

2231
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,920
The fundamental concept

2232
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,944
Due process related

2233
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,480
It's the state respecting a person

2234
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:14,368
Rights and how a person has a right to a trial before they're executed in prison or have their property seized by the state

2235
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,160
None of that's relevant to Twitter

2236
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:21,280
Twitter doesn't owe anyone a trial before they suspend their account this is just word salad Alex's throwing around

2237
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:24,608
The question of off-planet for behaviors even Lamer

2238
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:26,656
Because that's not applicable at all

2239
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:31,776
It's Oliver just organizing his rally and he didn't mention it on Twitter there's a good chance he'd still have a Twitter account

2240
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:34,336
However you mentioned it a bunch on Twitter

2241
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:39,456
One did Periscope video is already promoted at what the hospitals to show there were cars in front of

2242
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:44,320
He did a ton of on platform activity it was meant to promote is off-platform activity

2243
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,344
We just kind of the problem

2244
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,880
All through these complaints

2245
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,672
We bulshit you just trying to

2246
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:51,488
Grab victimhood to to wear like a

2247
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,256
Cape

2248
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,560
North pole shift

2249
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,864
It really really f******

2250
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:00,960
Your pennies hold rallies like I'm I'm really really mad

2251
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,520
Because the media is doing

2252
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,800
It all over again

2253
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,848
This is all

2254
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:08,640
Made up AstroTurf bulshit

2255
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:11,200
Party all over again

2256
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,480
Just ignore them

2257
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:15,808
Everytime they cover it and they do it as though it's like

2258
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:19,648
Right-wing protesters instead of being like these people are

2259
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,696
Literally f****** AstroTurf

2260
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:24,256
People trying to people like Alex

2261
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:30,656
Yeah that that many people really

2262
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,680
Matter what its two men

2263
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,448
It's too

2264
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,472
Stupid

2265
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,776
I don't know I don't

2266
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:42,176
I don't know if I agree 100% that you should just ignore it but I do think that maybe the coverage has been a little bit off

2267
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,968
That's what I would agree if you want really bad

2268
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:46,528
I'm talking about his fees sales

2269
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,808
Bright future

2270
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,600
And I want you to know

2271
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,392
Look

2272
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,696
My sales has never been about the Vine

2273
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:57,792
I sell my products but it's not about the virus

2274
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,072
It's about

2275
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,608
Do you need food

2276
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:02,912
Because he's going to collapse sure

2277
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:07,264
I knew would China shutting down

2278
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:11,872
Coming I said you better get ready better

2279
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:28,512
This was planned

2280
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,352
Six months ago before this even started Shore

2281
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,960
Hand sanitizers

2282
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:41,056
Alcohol

2283
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,336
Royals

2284
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:44,384
I was getting into the game

2285
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:48,480
God dammit this is been planned for 6 months

2286
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,576
The issue is that no one

2287
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:53,600
As a good Prada

2288
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,904
No one has

2289
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,184
We looked at

2290
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
Organic

2291
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:02,304
Hand sanitizer that actually leaves your hands

2292
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,096
Not oily but not dry

2293
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:09,472
What does that mean hate me it means they're not oily they're not dry they're healthy

2294
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:11,776
Okay

2295
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:14,592
So they're doing the sales pitch for this hand sanitizer

2296
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,616
Yeah I get through it

2297
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:18,432
And then Alex is like what's coming up on your show

2298
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,480
What are you up to today

2299
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:22,528
I need to say I will be definitely

2300
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:25,600
Talking about these new hand sanitizers

2301
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
What's the time

2302
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:33,792
I normally you know you tried to squeeze it right and then

2303
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:42,240
With a Sprite how come no one's done it it's a spray it's a spray hand sanitizer

2304
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,264
Organic hand sanitizer

2305
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:49,664
Spray bottle off the top of the head you have dr. Bronner's are primally pure

2306
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,688
Plenty of others

2307
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,992
Is only new to someone who didn't know it existed

2308
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,272
It's in no way an innovation

2309
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,064
I looked at the bottles

2310
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,088
And the ingredients

2311
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,112
Of Alex

2312
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,136
Suzanne sanitizer

2313
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,416
Edwards Essentials

2314
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:06,048
And I would bet just about anything I own that Alex is just private labeling dr. Bronner's hand sanitizer

2315
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:11,168
They're both packaged in almost identical to ounce bottles and they have identical like in greedy

2316
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:14,752
Ethyl alcohol water essential oil and glycerin

2317
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,848
Dr. Bronner's sells hand sanitizer both peppermint and lavender

2318
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:22,688
But they also sell the number of other so products with eucalyptus

2319
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,736
Which covers V3 set

2320
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,504
Spitaliks

2321
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,344
I have a tiger

2322
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,624
To create those three

2323
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:35,488
Has just entered into a reselling agreement with dr. Bronner's

2324
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:39,584
And he wants to pretend that he's been developing this amazing hand sanitizer for 6 months which

2325
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:42,144
I've no idea how cute even do that

2326
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,936
Wouldn't have a f****** life

2327
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:45,728
Get out of here

2328
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,264
2

2329
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,824
To absolutely

2330
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:54,688
I had my best scientists working on that

2331
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,480
Motivation

2332
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:58,272
By that are very very clear

2333
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:02,112
So this is the end of the third hour

2334
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,208
Here be the end of the show but Alex and Owen do a little bit

2335
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,744
The beginning of the fourth hour

2336
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:11,072
And this would be how the show ends if he actually

2337
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:14,400
Let the fourth our hosts have the whole for that

2338
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:20,032
I really want to take a lot of phone calls I got a lot of great

2339
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:22,080
Oh my God

2340
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:23,360
No for David Brock

2341
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:30,016
No I think it David brought Rakim

2342
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:32,320
Wow

2343
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,088
They're Nazis

2344
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,880
He also said they're sexy

2345
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:41,280
Yes that's that's how we go out to break with the playground

2346
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:43,840
Childish insinuations

2347
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,120
But Owen is gay

2348
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,656
Yeah yeah

2349
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:53,056
Why it is surprised that you I was amazed they made it this far without also belittle

2350
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:57,920
The queer Community that's a great idea

2351
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,968
Alex

2352
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,272
Play Around by calling Owen gay before

2353
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,040
Just like

2354
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:06,368
You're calling for war with China

2355
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:11,232
What you can't have a little fun all the way Dan do you can

2356
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:15,072
It's not fun it's childish bulshit in den den

2357
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:16,352
Incredible

2358
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:17,888
Credibly

2359
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:19,168
They come back

2360
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:20,448
And Owen

2361
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,216
Suggest

2362
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:21,984
That Alex

2363
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,008
Put his career on

2364
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:25,824
You know Alex that used to do career

2365
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:33,248
Diamond matches in the WWF WWE you should put your career on the line

2366
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,272
In a bare-knuckle

2367
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:39,904
Bra UFC style shutdown

2368
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:44,512
You have a lineup just Royal Rumble Style

2369
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:45,280
Over the ropes

2370
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:47,072
Put you out

2371
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,608
And that'll be it you put

2372
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:51,424
Free online all these people that want Alex Jones shutdown

2373
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,192
You can

2374
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:54,752
And his career he'll put his career on the line

2375
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,544
Would you do that

2376
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,360
Proceeds go to charity

2377
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:00,896
. sewing

2378
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:04,736
That's the Paradox close to

2379
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,528
Martial law

2380
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:10,112
Paradoxically under massive threat

2381
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:12,416
Because I'm intruding myself

2382
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:15,232
That's a completely unrelated thought

2383
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,512
I would suggest

2384
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
Pointless

2385
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:18,816
Put your

2386
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:21,376
Career on the line in a physical fight

2387
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,656
However

2388
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,680
In a knowledge fight

2389
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:26,496
Alex

2390
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,032
Debata point

2391
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,568
In a formal debate

2392
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:31,872
Like some point that he has

2393
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:38,272
Actually like independent position where he can't yell you can't just like overpower be like

2394
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:39,552
Like you can't just

2395
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:43,904
Talk a mile a minute and throw out all these pointless pieces of information

2396
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:46,464
Would he put his career on the line

2397
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,232
In a debate

2398
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:49,280
Absolutely no course not

2399
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:54,656
Put it on the line in a physical fight and he lost he wouldn't stick to itself course not

2400
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:01,056
And that is what they're talking about the end of Alex's Twitter

2401
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:06,688
You don't have a retirement match when you're in the middle of your career in order to retire

2402
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:08,224
Well that's what I'm

2403
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,760
I'm thinking right here like

2404
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:12,064
Owen should sound more worried

2405
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:15,136
A phone doesn't have all the information

2406
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:18,464
Then that would explain why he's very nonchalant here but

2407
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,768
Owen is not going to have a job

2408
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:27,680
If Alex goes down it's not like Owens going to take over Infowars and it's going to continue running

2409
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:34,080
It's not like Infowars is like CNN or something where it's at boss leaves

2410
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:37,920
Yeah yeah I know it's Alex sogos

2411
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:41,248
Who's going to get a job somewhere else

2412
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:46,880
The only way that Infowars survives past Alex is if Alex somehow gracefully exit

2413
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,672
With millions of dollars

2414
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:52,512
And a willingness to fund someone else's operator

2415
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:54,048
See that ever happened

2416
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:00,192
Especially considering that the way Alex might wind up leaving Infowars is going to leave Infowars bankrupt as well

2417
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,216
Actually

2418
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:05,824
You know what there is a way I could work but it would require Owen taking over

2419
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:09,664
And then taking a bunch of money from like dark money

2420
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,736
Funny places

2421
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:14,272
If one of these right-wing

2422
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,600
Places wanted to pay millions of dollars

2423
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,880
Beekeeping fourth running

2424
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,672
You could see that but it would

2425
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,952
I fundamentally change

2426
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:23,744
Probably some pieces of what

2427
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,888
Infowars might be the only company that spanfeller could run properly

2428
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:34,752
And you know when you're talking about a retirement match your not

2429
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:37,568
In the business of staying around for very long

2430
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:40,384
And Alex ends with the pretty Doom

2431
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,920
Doom soda volume

2432
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,248
It's money

2433
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,552
Wow. They have all the lawyers

2434
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,600
Hold off

2435
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,368
Stayed

2436
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:51,904
You know about

2437
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,024
Just been money

2438
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:58,304
Black

2439
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,328
Anime

2440
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:00,608
Let's let any

2441
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:05,728
Right now it's

2442
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,544
Now more than ever with a gun to my head

2443
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,592
It is now 100%.

2444
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:12,384
Tell you about the stuff right now but

2445
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:16,736
I got the stick

2446
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,832
Is right now

2447
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,392
Does about it

2448
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,464
And White House is just cut off they just think they say

2449
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:29,792
They can only put out made messages that's about it they're they're cut off as well

2450
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:33,376
So he's got the key they had the carrot now they've got the stick

2451
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:34,656
I just can't help it

2452
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:38,496
Would feel like there's something like as a shoe he knows is going to fall

2453
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:40,544
And I will see

2454
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,848
There that means there is a Sikh

2455
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:47,968
Yeah and I don't think you would be saying that about the Sandy Hook case

2456
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:54,112
It's not till the end of the year if it's not even going to be postponed because of the Coronavirus

2457
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,648
Easily see that happening

2458
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:58,208
So I don't know it's there's something

2459
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,256
Sort of immediate thing he refuses to

2460
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,536
To discuss on a RN

2461
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:03,584
Is only a few possibilities a deck

2462
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,120
Man this is

2463
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:09,984
I really really will be disappointed if he doesn't

2464
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:10,752
Get

2465
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,288
Taken down by this

2466
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,312
Something

2467
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,080
Soon

2468
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,384
Yeah this one

2469
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,176
Again I'm going to feel really

2470
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:18,944
Despondent

2471
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,248
Like there's just let yourself

2472
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,272
You can't let yourself put

2473
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:28,160
Put build too much assumption that you only have to win once

2474
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:31,488
So you can lose and lose and lose and lose and lose but if you wouldn't want to

2475
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,512
It's

2476
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,280
You know

2477
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,560
It's it's done but

2478
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,096
And if he just

2479
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:39,168
Keeps escaping this b******* I'm going to be real disappointed

2480
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:42,752
Damn that's a failure on so many people's backs

2481
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:44,544
You know I don't know I don't know

2482
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,616
It's it's a situation where like

2483
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,384
Probably

2484
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,664
We'll end this week

2485
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,456
And nothing will happen

2486
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:53,248
But there's a outside chance

2487
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,272
Alex could be

2488
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:56,064
Booked this week

2489
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,392
I mean no matter what

2490
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,184
He's not going to be on

2491
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:05,280
Are most this week probably

2492
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:07,584
Talking to lawyers

2493
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:14,496
Wacky Wednesday

2494
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,520
Friday this week

2495
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:17,824
Or will have the best week of Our Lives

2496
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,664
Episode of the weekend

2497
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:25,760
Anyway Jordan

2498
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:32,160
