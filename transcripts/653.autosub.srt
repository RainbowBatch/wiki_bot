1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex

6
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
What's up

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Quick question

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
Horizon forbidden West

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
So good recording and I was really

10
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,504
Questioning was whether or not it would

11
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Live up

12
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,576
To really high expectation

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,672
Super far into the game but so far it has

14
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
Exceeded

15
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
Expectations

16
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Which is surprising

17
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Oh yeah

18
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
We haven't no spoilers policies course

19
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm having a great

20
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,288
Oh no the moment the moment you started you texted me something about it and I texted you immediately back like

21
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
I slid beneath the legs of a Tyrannosaurus Rex slow-motion fired an electrical arrow in the

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
Thing blew up in who's the most satisfying experience I've had

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,392
In so long they added some new mechanics teams that are like really interesting

24
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,072
My bright spot is yesterday I got the chance to get together with my cousin

25
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Who I haven't seen for a while even very close and they have a new French

26
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
And it is

27
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
So goddamn cute

28
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
And you get to hold it

29
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
That's a bright spot for

30
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
Yeah I think so I'm not a dog guy but even I can appreciate

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,856
Little puppies in the crook of my arm

32
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
I get it

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,976
So Jordan today we got to

34
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
To dive into

35
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
February 25th

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,216
2022 we're going to be doing is a deep deconstruction of

37
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
The idea that Alex

38
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
Predicted this war

39
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Oh okay

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
We heard him tiramisu we were going to split up into its component parts

41
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:04,832
Molecular Gastronomy Alex's bulshit

42
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm so excited to get into that

43
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
The rest of the stuff

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Not so much excited to get into we will deal with it all on the other side

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Hello.

46
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
Thanks.

47
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
Rachel's infuriating Breaky time

48
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
Proud of you.

49
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
!

50
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
Thank you so much boy with a little bit of swagger busting it down

51
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,304
Sexual style is he goaded with the sauce most definitely not think

52
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
That's what your nail polish

53
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
I'm a policy wonk

54
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
Thank you

55
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Mud

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
O'Reilly

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
I'm a policy wonk

58
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
The writers on the show have been teasing me for five damn years now when are these Dan and Jordan guys going to finally get together thank you so

59
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
I'm a policy wonk

60
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
I have

61
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Risen above

62
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Miami

63
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
And then we're going to come back

64
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
And I'm going to start the show over

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
F*** you

66
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,479
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

67
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
F*** you and your new world order

68
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
And f****** horse you rode in on

69
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
And all your s***

70
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Maybe today

71
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

72
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

73
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
And you never see me again

74
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Really what I want to do

75
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
I never want to come back here again

76
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Apologize to

77
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Yesterday that I

78
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,335
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

79
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
I'll be better tomorrow

80
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
He's not

81
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Yeah I'm positive

82
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
Not good

83
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
Not better from the last time we saw him

84
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
Hard to get word discussion and content in the lead-up to

85
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,143
Ukraine being invaded by Russia and his response

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Immediately

87
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Was that

88
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Isn't that

89
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
So I guess no contact dropped from Today Show

90
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
Leo zagami is way underrated that dude is the real deal I'll leave it at that

91
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
I would agree with him if he's talking about Leo's music

92
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
Play underrated underrated he had a good stretch there in the early thousands

93
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Hung out man he was

94
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,703
King of the underground Roman techno seed

95
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,799
The real deal better

96
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,407
So we start here at the beginning of the episode on February twenty

97
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
5th and

98
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
This is where we're going

99
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
To dive immediately

100
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
Into the discussion about Alex's predict

101
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
And here we go

102
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
All hell has broken loose

103
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,487
That lot of people that ask how did I know

104
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
Remember December

105
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Told you how I

106
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
I knew that

107
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
The ice

108
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Melt

109
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,543
Football game

110
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
By the end of February

111
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
And major Financial

112
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
Individuals I talked to the highest levels

113
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Get ready

114
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
For war in February

115
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Not just

116
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Russia but also China and I told you that

117
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,743
How does he do it he must be a secret agent

118
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Or Jones

119
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
For the last 4 months

120
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
5 months

121
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Come

122
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
At the end of February

123
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
So what are the central pieces of Alex's coverage of the invasion of Ukraine has been about how he was going to be a war

124
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Back in the fall to early winter

125
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Of last year

126
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
That's become a bit of a medium and he can see people posting about Alex's remarkable prediction on Twitter another message

127
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,303
So I felt like a really good use of our time would be to really dig into this

128
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
And see what Alex predicted

129
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
And talk about

130
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Hawaii keys

131
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Full of s***

132
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,263
Unbranded video Alex posted a video with the title quote

133
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Watch Alex Jones predict

134
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,127
War in Ukraine by February compilation

135
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
This is on his own website

136
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
But providing evidence of his prediction

137
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
So this is what I'm going to base

138
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,159
My discussion on it's his own evidence exactly what the title

139
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Ukraine by February

140
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Compilation

141
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,559
So it is a compilation of a number of clips from different shows

142
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
Deal with them

143
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,727
None of this is selectively edited to remove anything from the compilation he posted

144
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,847
These clips are going to be played exactly as they appear there only separated

145
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
By which show they're from

146
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
So this first clip here is from

147
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
October 21st

148
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
2021

149
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
The smart money

150
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Is on award show

151
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
And I don't want to war

152
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
But

153
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
We're looking at a giant Warren

154
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
February right now

155
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
Projections with the top people on the Earth

156
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
You playing

157
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
They're not with the New World Order combine

158
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
In war in February

159
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,127
This is the type of time but right before World War before World War II

160
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
When everything kicks off

161
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
And I hope

162
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
That doesn't happen

163
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
But

164
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Currently

165
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
That is the tragic

166
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Actually we're on

167
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
And there is a

168
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Consensus

169
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
On that

170
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
And a large concern

171
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
I don't need a consensus with people that just live here in Austin

172
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
The new-made powerbomb of the country

173
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
I'm talking about

174
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
All over the world

175
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Contacts

176
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
And

177
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Errol Flynn things

178
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
War with China is in

179
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
He was Raising alarm 10 years ago on that that's what I got mad at

180
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Do all the smart people I talk

181
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Say the same thing I'm saying

182
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
So the first obvious problem with this clip is that Alex is predicting a war with China which hasn't happened

183
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Has his own ever

184
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Yes

185
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
So he left

186
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
The part in where he said this is going to be war with China

187
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
What is the problem

188
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,311
So taking nothing to do with Russia or Ukraine

189
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
The problem for me

190
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
The second thing to note here is that while Alex is talking if you watch the video they flashup b-roll the video of

191
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Podcast witch

192
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Doesn't make sense

193
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,391
Unless you know the larger context of where this clip came from

194
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
When Alex mentions this new Power Center in Austin

195
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,327
That's because just before this clip Alex into repeatedly and embarrassingly insist

196
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
But he wasn't just talking about Rogan

197
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,495
And the reason he had to do this is because these comments that he's making on the 21st

198
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
Or actually an extension of a story

199
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
He told the day before

200
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Which is from the 20th

201
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
Probably

202
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Avakin

203
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
This is going to end

204
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
Gigantic massive

205
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Billions dead

206
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
I don't know

207
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Public yet but I guess

208
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Is coming here

209
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,567
Some other things to learn some really interesting things

210
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
But

211
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,687
I'm not ready to talk about that

212
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Where am I from Joe

213
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
All the people he runs with

214
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
You can probably imagine

215
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Wiethop

216
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
I am.

217
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
Elon Musk

218
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,519
Alex has been out with Rogan the night before having some drinks along with Lex fridman and Michael malice

219
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
The information that Alex allegedly has it comes from them

220
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,431
Secondhand which Alex is very clear about on the 20th

221
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
There was

222
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Michelle's

223
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Joe Rogan

224
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Lex fridman

225
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Michael malice

226
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Quieter

227
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
Quite a group of people there

228
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
The open

229
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
We just have to discuss what is going to be like going through this

230
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
And I learned a lot of interesting Intel

231
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Okay but I won't go

232
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
They only are

233
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
Because they all have their own little Intel

234
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,895
This is an instance of Alex he's in one of his regular strategy

235
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,735
Which is basically just a combination of escalation and obscuring

236
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,599
I'm a 20 if you tell the story of being out with Rogan and a couple of his weirdo friend

237
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
Andover drinks they talk about how they feel like war is come

238
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,791
Call the 21st Alex embellishes this story to be about all these high-level sources he's talk

239
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,887
In reality it's just a continuation of a story from the day prior

240
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Which is why he needs to insist that he's not

241
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Just talking about Rogan

242
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Alex does this a lot

243
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
We've seen instances of him taking information that a caller gives him one day which goes on to report is coming from an unnamed High

244
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
High-level source

245
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
The next day

246
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,551
I guess what Alex probably wants the audience to think is that a minimum

247
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,879
This is something with Elon Musk has told Rogan and then Road

248
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
It doesn't really matter

249
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
The information he's providing doesn't come from any high-level source and more importantly

250
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,119
The prediction that he's made based on that fake Intel hasn't come true

251
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
This is about war with

252
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
China

253
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
It's not relevant

254
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
Again it's also about United States war with China which the United States is not currently at war with China

255
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Am I correct

256
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
You are okay

257
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
So on to the next clip

258
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,247
Now this clip is from July 21st 2021

259
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
And you better get pumped

260
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Because it features

261
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
A guest appearance

262
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
From the guy who took sole credit for 911

263
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
Leo zagami

264
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,791
Biological bacteriological virus

265
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,143
Next is the Cyber which they tell us in the Nexus nuclear lay that out

266
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,543
Yes and the cyber warfare basically is already taking place with all this

267
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Constantly and then of course we have the nuclear now the nuclear is already starting to be announced

268
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
China threatens to Nuke

269
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
I want yesterday here's the headline Fox News going to keep going

270
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Official jerseys daily

271
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
They said we will nuke Japan

272
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
As you can see the garage

273
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:03,007
Free phases of over this Superior that we unfortunately going to be leaving and that the

274
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
The will of course diminish

275
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
The population of deer

276
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
That is absolutely nothing to do with the current situation

277
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
It doesn't mention February 20-22 radiological weapons

278
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Not Russia

279
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:21,695
This clip is also being taken wildly out of context in order for it to be used in this compilation

280
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
Here is the actual context of what

281
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
Alex and Leo are talking about just before this clip starts

282
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
I know you don't want to

283
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
If you don't know

284
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
Research

285
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
What's the time

286
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Takeover how long does happen

287
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
How long we got to survive

288
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
22 2030 there's a free stages take over the fastest bacteriological Warfare the second the sidewalk

289
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Warfare defend is nuclear warfare

290
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Saudis

291
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Free scenarios

292
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
Will BMV

293
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
In the next nine years

294
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,071
This conversation has nothing to do with Russia invading Ukraine let alone doing it

295
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
In February

296
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,447
It's two lunatics tacotote Imagine The Devils schedule looks like over the next decade

297
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
This clip is meaning

298
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,287
Yeah I mean we're still ain't even in his

299
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,871
We should still be in the first bacteriological phase

300
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
At least cyberwarfare we're not in full nuclear war

301
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,159
Will be way ahead

302
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
I don't know of any art

303
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
That exist

304
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,791
Set the pics of the devil as being ahead of schedule

305
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,007
I think there's a lack of strategic tension if the devil had downtown

306
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,151
The devil is like waiting at a diner for you just like sitting there like I can't believe he's like 10 literally

307
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Literally me just sitting typing is huh

308
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
Need to be busy all the time

309
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:59,487
So this next clip is from February 17th 2021 and it's important to understand this show

310
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Is it a game from

311
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
Was during the 2021 winter storm in Texas

312
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,935
Particularly grumpy about how he doesn't have his fun LED background in the

313
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
The studio and they have to run the show

314
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
On backup generator

315
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
They may even

316
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
I have Bible Stand Down

317
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
The first strike

318
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
From China

319
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
My guts

320
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Never been wrong

321
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
Ever

322
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Last month

323
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
The United States

324
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Going to be hit by nuclear

325
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Your weapons by China

326
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Stand Down

327
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Stay in your homes

328
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
OU

329
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Your powers off

330
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Approve that coming

331
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
And they're just getting us ready for the disaster

332
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
I'm going to hit the main cities

333
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Very good chance

334
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,199
That they're going to either blow the entire power grid with a

335
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
Get ready for or they're going to hit us

336
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
First strike

337
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
And you're like

338
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
America

339
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
It's gone

340
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Been awhile at the house

341
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
And I was in

342
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Because they're going to be removed

343
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,055
So I just I got to be honest with you false it's all a

344
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Okay it's all a

345
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Military

346
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
Against this has nothing to do with Russia or Ukraine and doesn't mention February this is the u.s.

347
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,999
He's also not like a specific timeframe

348
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
The year ago

349
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,655
This clip is utterly meaningless in terms what this compilation is supposed to demonstrate

350
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
They believed it Alex predicted this war back in mid-to-late

351
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
2021

352
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
This is s***

353
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Here's what I

354
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
I am getting

355
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Alex

356
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Without

357
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Question

358
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,807
Has at a certain point in time said that Russia and Ukraine will go to war

359
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
I've no doubt it

360
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
Somewhere along the way only one of these clips will sort of get into that

361
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
But that would take a lot of effort

362
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,935
Probably I also think

363
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,543
As this this next Clipper we're going to talk about sort of illustrate

364
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,919
Maybe some of the times you talked about it would undercut his actual argument on that point of this

365
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Compilation

366
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Let's get to that

367
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,551
This next clip is from November 16th 2021

368
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
And it's pretty short

369
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
Having a really big ones today

370
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
Ethnic Wars about

371
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Start something

372
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Xbox go down

373
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
That means nothing

374
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
You probably are asking why is that clipso shortened

375
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
It's compilation it seems

376
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Weird

377
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
And that's because

378
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
This is what

379
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
He said around that clip

380
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,615
It's really huge and got me having butterflies right now

381
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
I'm having a really big

382
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Start something

383
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Xbox

384
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Go down

385
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
My Spidey Sense

386
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Never been this strong it's

387
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Bonfire right

388
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Talk about

389
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Stomach

390
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Yeah that is

391
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
That is some energy right there there's some

392
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
Big stuff

393
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
China threatened war with United States

394
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,991
CIA says righteous preparing to invade

395
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,575
Ukraine which I don't believe a word they say

396
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Haha

397
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
Hahaha

398
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,511
Smart too smart to Clipper real sport

399
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
Where he's predicting War he says that the Russians would not invade Ukraine CIA says that

400
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
Whoever put this compilation together has to if know that that's what he says immediately after this quarter

401
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
He says all I feel like war is coming

402
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,367
That's useful for the compilation and they know that f****** people who see this compilation are going to ever

403
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
The time or the interest to go back and be like

404
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,999
Wait a minute you lie after this he said that Russia isn't going to invade

405
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
So this means that not only is his compilation entirely about the United States and China fight

406
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Fighting game

407
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
Is not happening it is also

408
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Moving the parts where he said

409
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,359
Russia won't do the thing that is happening

410
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
In order to bolster his case that he is not just

411
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Not wrong

412
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
But precious

413
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
Yeah it's an abusive lie and it's very intentional

414
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,231
Well opposite of what this compilation is supposed to

415
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
So cut it out

416
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
So we can just make it look like he did

417
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Yep

418
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,679
Yep it's such dogshit is like how a child would think

419
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
To the next A2 is from December 1st

420
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
2021

421
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
And

422
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
Yeah I don't think this helps

423
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,479
We are not just here talkin about what they've already done.

424
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
We must ask ourselves how would they carry out

425
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Mass extermination on

426
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Operation

427
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
It's already killed Millions worldwide

428
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
That are soft kill binary weapon

429
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
How would

430
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
They

431
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Get away with that

432
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
The answer is

433
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
A massive Financial collapse

434
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
A warm

435
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,872
So this is no specifics involved it's just Alex saying that he thinks the globalist

436
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:41,760
Start a war or collapse the economy to distract them there covid bioweapon plans he's insisted

437
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
He'll expose coming to life

438
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,648
Isn't meaningless and does nothing to show that Alex made any specific prediction

439
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,208
About Ukraine Russia or the month of February

440
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
Let alone all of them

441
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Together

442
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,584
This next week later on December 8th

443
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
2021 and Willow

444
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Where we got here

445
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
The imf's machine

446
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Global Financial collapse

447
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
Cyber attack

448
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
Oh and imminent war with Russia

449
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
So I guess China can swoop into

450
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,856
Taiwan Hong Kong

451
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,696
South China Sea

452
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Vietnam now

453
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
That's

454
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,632
How World War start with the same political cultural spiritual

455
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Economic climate

456
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
The world was in

457
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
On the eve of World War I

458
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
1940

459
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
And we're

460
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
In the same

461
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
Geopolitical

462
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
Economic culture

463
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
Spiritual position we were in

464
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
Right before

465
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,648
There are more than 50,000

466
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
Nuclear weapons

467
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Conservatively on the plan

468
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
My problem

469
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Most of the work

470
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Half mile of Mi up

471
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Destroy

472
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Real estate and kill humans

473
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Each win the nuclear reactor

474
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
Go offline and start melting down

475
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
And we've got

476
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,944
He 100-plus chernobyl's look forward to

477
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,808
I won't be safe in a little bunkers from themselves

478
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,440
China nuking us or against nuclear power plants melting down

479
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,304
Has nothing to do with the prediction of war between Russia and Ukraine and doesn't involve February at all

480
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888
Chernobyl so I guess we're getting

481
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
Closer

482
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
I guess yeah there was one jump in there too clearly trying to make two parts of this episode mashed together

483
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Make it look likely thoughts appear to be more directly connected

484
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
And then there's another jump-cut which steaks

485
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Take us to the next clip

486
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
It is also from this December 8th episode

487
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,624
U.s. Senator won't rule out nuclear strike

488
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Against

489
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,464
Well isn't that just sweet

490
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,536
And I got stacks of articles with them threatening

491
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,864
And and then already moving their weapons up to the Russian border

492
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,192
And the Russians are like okay you're taking over a country that

493
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
90% Russia

494
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
In the east

495
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
30%

496
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
And you your cigarette at a car

497
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,384
Gas pipelines in our facilities

498
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
With NATO troops we're going to stop that

499
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
And their answers will just nuke you then

500
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,856
I predict the Russians are going to roll in

501
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
Swollen

502
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
And there's a good chance this psychotic crazy people

503
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
Could be killing us with the shots in the bio-weapon Everly

504
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
Watch tactical nuclear weapons to Russian

505
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,752
And the Russians are going to respond by destroying nature

506
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
And it about

507
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
15 minutes into that

508
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
Papa and the cruise missiles get fired

509
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,784
Where's a good run while we had it right wheel of Satan right

510
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Loverboy she will guess what

511
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,856
Y'all get ready to die

512
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
The closest we're probably going to get

513
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
Discovering an interview on Fox News

514
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
Ukraine because this conversation was already happening

515
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
December

516
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
Entrancing about other news and interviews on other news channels Alex said he thought that Russia was going to quote

517
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Rolin

518
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,408
Which isn't specific enough to interpret is him being correct or incorrect

519
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
Depending on your preference

520
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
What's more important

521
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,272
Is that the rest of the stuff he's ranting about his

522
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Completely off base

523
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
So at this point he also never said that it was going to happen in February

524
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,304
He was thinking Derby military action that's contained within the Don boss region

525
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,960
The only way to make this seem accurate is to be really generous which Alex doesn't deserve any even if you do he's no

526
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
Not saying February

527
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,080
No these are disconnected thoughts and even then he is looking

528
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
NATO as the aggressor

529
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Right

530
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Maybe he's like Russia is

531
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
Justified

532
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
In which roughly did which

533
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
Based on some of his other comments in

534
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:05,440
Career you shouldn't be too surprised by

535
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,304
I'm predicting that this war is happening you definitely weren't predicting that Russia was going

536
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
Going to be invading

537
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,656
The entire country

538
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:18,496
Very broad reading of uber lamp

539
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,360
So there's one last weapon this compilation and it's from January 5th 2022

540
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,688
Globalist get out of this without nuclear meltdown

541
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
The service we are becoming a little bowl in every

542
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
Every actuaries madani mother pentagon

543
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Why are they following a path

544
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
Will

545
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,416
Pause math War masturbation

546
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
A nuclear meltdown because it's

547
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
A planetary ending event

548
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,912
Look up means nothing and is no predictive quality to it at all

549
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:53,568
When taking their totality the compilation involves Alex mostly talking about his fears about China nuking the United States and

550
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
February once

551
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
Not even in relation to Russia

552
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,248
This is a really A desperate attempt on Alex's part to capitalize on the tragic

553
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Aventador

554
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Complacent

555
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
And use them to inflate his sense of self

556
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,952
It really grotesque motivation he's displaying particularly considering how weak the oven in

557
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
He's presented

558
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
Is Voorhees supposed

559
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Prediction

560
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
The reason that this works on people is because most people don't have the time to actually listen to Alex's show so they don't know what the context

561
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
His foremost these clips

562
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,288
Place together the way they are they given appearance that's

563
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Dishonest

564
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
He's talking about about war

565
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
And he says Russia wants

566
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,224
Twice he says he thinks Russia is going to quote roll into Ukraine

567
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
Earlier in a different clip he said February

568
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
If you're not paying attention

569
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
Disconnect to these clips are you run the risk of combining them in your head

570
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
To give Alex

571
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,232
What's credit for a prediction absolutely didn't make

572
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,560
You run the risk of being the rube that he made this clip

573
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
2 and a lot of people have fallen for

574
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,424
In reality Alex predict War all the time

575
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,752
I will grant him that the vast majority of these predictions

576
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Has gas

577
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Make a

578
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,640
Kind of obsessing about Civil War or race war

579
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:07,040
The geopolitical variety does happen sometimes butter is really just insight met based on his culture War big

580
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
That's kind of

581
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
The Sweet Spot for a

582
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,928
Predictions Alex make slideshow historically

583
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
It's been

584
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,512
A lot of financial collapse type stuff that's

585
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,816
Certainly something he does all the time or has

586
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,376
But that's because

587
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
One of the big reasons and the other is because it helps him attack the Federal Reserve if he insists the collapse is just right

588
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,104
Around the corner

589
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
Tacitly predict that never happen

590
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Except for

591
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:41,600
And then you get to look like that all I predicted it literally

592
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:46,720
Once then crash of 1987 happened it's been like every 10 years

593
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
You know it's just there

594
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,072
I'm predicting

595
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
Is something that

596
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
You're never going to

597
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:57,216
Eventually long enough scale you're going to be right eventually

598
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,872
And if you give yourself credit for predicting Russia invading Ukraine by yelling about

599
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
China Dukan beehive state

600
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
A bunch then

601
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
You've Won

602
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
The pointless game

603
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
That is so

604
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Is like

605
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,904
Loki

606
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Such a f******

607
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,232
Disgusting Psychopathic things

608
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
Look at all of this destruction and death

609
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
That makes me feel good

610
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Cuz I was right

611
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
You know I wasn't

612
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,800
Edit clips

613
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
Makes me feel good still somehow

614
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,944
Which is really the only thing about that cares about

615
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,296
Also and I think it's important to point out is that Alex predict his own imminent death

616
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,344
Pretty frequent occasions

617
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
Haven't happened yet

618
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:51,744
And of course gives constant failed predictions about false flags that he insisted going to happen

619
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
The point here is that Alex didn't predict anything

620
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:00,192
This video he released as a disgrace and it doesn't even show him predicting what's going on in the world today

621
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:06,592
It includes the clip it had to be edited short so it would include the part where Alex says he doesn't think that Russia is going to invade Ukraine

622
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Just not use that one

623
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,688
He's a piece of s*** and this is how he tries to make money

624
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
To get attention off this war

625
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
It also

626
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,064
How is the temperature lower people's attention away from the fact

627
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
That all through the

628
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
Beginning of last week was going on and on about how great

629
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
Honest Putin was and how

630
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,792
You can find no fault with him and that he should take Tonasket Lots

631
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
These comments look really bad now so in

632
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Instead of apologizing for that

633
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,472
He starts this b******* campaign basically Nostradamus

634
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
Because I was a liar and a f****** coward

635
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
I feel really

636
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,896
I don't know I mean obviously I think

637
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,480
It is bread-and-butter to do detestable thing

638
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,368
So this is just another in the long line of them right I think that the circumstances being what they are elevate

639
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
Take this to a different level of

640
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
Shitheadra

641
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
The other thing is that this

642
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Is

643
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Something that is

644
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
It's a it's a luer

645
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
Much like are you using fishing

646
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,008
You know like this is trying to get people on the hook

647
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
You posted

648
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:14,432
This compilation on the social media and you try and trick people who wouldn't otherwise

649
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,088
Maybe I've been being lied to about alleger all this time I heard that he was bad and I know he got kicked off social media but

650
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,928
A lot of good people have been kicked off social media give him a try

651
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
There's a lot of

652
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Possibly well-intentioned people who might

653
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
I get by this

654
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
And

655
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,912
I think the arguing against

656
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,448
Somebody posting this

657
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Him

658
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
Difficult because you have to engage with it

659
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Enough

660
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
To be like

661
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
That's not what he's predicting right and then

662
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
You don't know where those clips are from and it would take

663
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
A person who is

664
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
Me Providence

665
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,904
Probably it would drive people mad but I'm already mad

666
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
So I can I can handle doing this but

667
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Such a

668
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
Dangerous

669
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Propaganda tactics

670
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
I bet that is reprehensible

671
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:12,288
The irony being you or the theoretical rube that gets caught on the end of this hook

672
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,408
Will have gone there because they think that Alex is right about Russia starting a war

673
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,736
And if they stay there long enough will eventually support poop

674
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
Yes among other things

675
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
If you end up

676
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,768
Getting sucked in by this and then they are cloud

677
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:38,656
If Alex can predict this you must you must actually have really great information maybe I should listen to him

678
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,728
He's going to do it yeah you could end up believing all sorts of

679
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Devilry

680
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Yep sucks

681
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:51,200
Let's get back to the present day

682
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
So Alex believes

683
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,832
Of course I heard a little bit of that in one of his clubs

684
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
For the past but that's

685
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
Yeah this is Russia's fault

686
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Republican and Democratic senators

687
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,560
Calling for more military aid to Ukraine

688
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
What got this going in the first place and weapons being shipped in

689
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
To the Russian border

690
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Poking the bear

691
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
Grizzly bear

692
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
Dan at the zoo and wondering why I teach you

693
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,384
Bengal tigers

694
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
Gorillas in wonder why they get their head ripped off

695
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
What

696
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
And whatever happened

697
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
This is historic

698
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:38,304
This is an incoherent position and if you actually think about Alex's position

699
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Begin coherent

700
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
Because the Alternatives just don't work now

701
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:47,520
If this is actually a situation where the West is regressing on Russia's Border in Alex's stated a bunch of times that he

702
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
I believe that the Don boss isn't the part of Ukraine

703
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
Then why wouldn't he support Russian Putin's action

704
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
He definitely supported them hypothetically last week

705
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:02,112
Before they became a reality disposition is no good because Putin is actually doing the thing Alex want

706
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
Did that happen and it's f****** horrific

707
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,512
Alex makes money in the space where he yells about things that people aren't going to do

708
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:13,632
Like Ron Paul would do he was President Trump should Outlaw the Democratic Party

709
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,984
It's a real problem in the things he supports end up happening it doesn't happen that often

710
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
But when it does

711
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
It usually involves a lot of people die

712
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
Right and

713
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
It doesn't want to

714
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
Make me feel bad

715
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
Yeah but look at it from the other side

716
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
And you realize Alex can't take the opposite position either

717
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,088
He can't see the Putin is entirely in the wrong and that he had no justice

718
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:39,488
Application for invading because that threatens the very long-standing positive coverage that enforces had regarding poop

719
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
He's been built up his

720
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,424
The one great hope of defeating the global is so if you take the position that he just invaded a sovereign country for no reason

721
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
You're going to men

722
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
Funny questions to answer

723
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
Plus Alex

724
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,336
And he knows that a whole lot of his audience loves

725
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Putin invade

726
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Sogo

727
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,944
Is going to be bad for his bottom line

728
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,064
And thus you get this middle-of-the-road b******* where Alex gives lip service to protect

729
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,928
Take me to post the invasion while simultaneously placing the blame entirely on Western powers

730
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,720
And thereby completely absolving Putin

731
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
The blame for the entire

732
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Now

733
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
It is all on him

734
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Somehow

735
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:22,752
Well he's trying I was just trying to say like whatever happens now is on him

736
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
Jesus totally reasonable

737
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
What are you doing

738
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
It's a bizarre position

739
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,224
I think it's entirely the West fault

740
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,576
Obviously Russia should it Putin should invade and now it's all Putin's fault

741
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
What

742
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
What

743
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
What are you talkin

744
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,488
You understand I really think

745
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,304
If you if you take the time to really focus on so I think

746
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,912
A number of his positions throughout his career has had to be the same kind of

747
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,240
Completely internally inconsistent thing because

748
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
You going either way is not going to work

749
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,616
I think when you see that it's

750
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
It's really the Hallmark

751
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
If somebody that you should not

752
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
The trust yeah they're up to something

753
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
That's an

754
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,440
So we get to you I was talking about his fears about Cyber attack

755
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,256
Going to be a false-flag cyberattack

756
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Against

757
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
Well Rush is going

758
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,168
To be the victim of that NATO is going to run the false flag

759
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Against Russia

760
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
In order to

761
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Start a war

762
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Here

763
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Is the big escalation

764
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,272
All the Talking Heads saying others any type of Cyber attack

765
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
Anywhere outside of Ukraine in a NATO member

766
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,440
And that if so much as a stoplight

767
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Take those out

768
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
Blamed on the Russians

769
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Senator

770
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Warner Brothers actually said that

771
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
Eviction

772
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,752
Bueno stop light going out

773
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
U.s. troops have a car wreck

774
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,408
Article 5 and go to war with Russia

775
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
Nicely in the world as we know it

776
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
So there's that issue

777
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Against

778
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Poland

779
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Or against

780
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Hungry

781
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
Against

782
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
Are the Czech Republic organic

783
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Germany

784
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,888
You know hacker groups and you know different globalist groups

785
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
Going to try

786
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
To scar the shop and accelerate

787
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,800
Conversation about like a stoplight

788
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,640
Put out

789
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,480
Used in the context of like it introduces really bizarre question

790
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Yeah

791
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:48,672
If there is a cyber-attack that Russia does against Ukraine it has the potential to affect the infrastructure

792
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
Of other countries

793
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
And

794
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
Does that

795
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,816
Require right kind of an article 5

796
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
It's not saying

797
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,400
Stop light goes out we're going to f***

798
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:04,800
Concentra it's it's more like the system is so completely and

799
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
Utterly interconnected and complex

800
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
That the idea of what is and is not a specific attack on whom is difficult now to even

801
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,832
I understand but also reporting this

802
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,392
Some kind of like mind-blowing new conversation but that's

803
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Stupid

804
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:27,072
The NATO secretary-general Jens stoltenberg has been saying that cyber-attacks on a member country could trigger r

805
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,888
Article 57 at least 2019 if not earlier

806
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,032
It's never really fully articulated but if you read his comments it seems pretty clear that the way Article 5 would be invoked

807
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,872
In that situation is in terms of retaliating in the cyberspace

808
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
Not in terms of a physical War

809
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,552
Right so they're there interpretation would be if we trickle are trigger article 50

810
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,112
For this purpose and can we can meet it

811
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
At that same

812
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
Maybe that's not always

813
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,000
Consistent but that seems to be the way it's disgusting about cyber

814
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,352
Stoltenberg wrote an article in Prospect magazine in 2019 that includes

815
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
This passage

816
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
As we look ahead we must

817
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,008
Continue to build a strong and diverse Workforce of future cyber Defender

818
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
The UK has already started doing this with cyber first

819
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,432
A program aimed at supporting and preparing undergraduates for a career in cybersecurity

820
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:20,320
We must be smart smart about recruiting training and retaining highly-skilled cyber experts

821
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,368
They make sure their skills are kept Sharp

822
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
Through regular exercises

823
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,232
As we do for instance through our cyber Coalition exercises

824
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,376
Cyberspace is the new Battleground and making NATO cyber ready while resource well-trained and well-equipped

825
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Is a top priority

826
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,496
Article 5 really just says that if a member countries attacked the other state

827
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
It's come to their defense

828
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,824
It doesn't require that that defense be a Landon

829
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:48,224
Anyway you can tell her that Alex is laying some groundwork to be able to claim that he predicted a false-flag cyberattack

830
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
If Richard does do something

831
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,296
Or there is a Cyber attack

832
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
He can be like a high do it I called it

833
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
Bright

834
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
No it's not

835
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
That's no not good

836
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Not helpful

837
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
But at least he'd named more than six NATO state

838
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,536
So that's that's pretty good

839
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:07,168
I wasn't counting Republic

840
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704
So

841
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:14,848
You remember in the lead-up to The Invasion there was a lot of conversation

842
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
People like

843
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
Do people like Biden

844
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
Us

845
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
State Department

846
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,296
We're saying that there was information

847
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,392
That Rush a plan to provocation false-flag pretext

848
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
Foregoing in

849
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
What do you what was Alex's response.

850
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
I believe Alex is a response to that was to say that it would not happen like false flag

851
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:43,520
Just don't happen

852
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
I couldn't get that I was like

853
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
He didn't say that

854
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
All false Flags don't happen up crazy

855
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
What you did say

856
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Somebody like

857
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,064
Let It Go history never

858
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Pretty pissed off based on his own expertise

859
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
The United States

860
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Whoop

861
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
If you think

862
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,840
It's easy to Stage a false flag

863
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,192
State Department

864
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Car bombs going off right as the Russian

865
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
Invade

866
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
As a pretext

867
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
Military

868
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
Military class 5 manual

869
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
Usually you don't want to kill people

870
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Blow up

871
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,648
Blow up you know where I am busy building

872
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Barracks

873
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
Pretext

874
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
It does look like some

875
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
And she it's okay to talk about

876
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:44,192
This guy calls himself the world's foremost expert on false flag

877
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
I guess Russia did a false flag after all

878
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,592
Looks like a state department is right and I the world's foremost expert was wrong

879
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Alex was

880
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,199
Just wrong he was pissed off that anyone other than him was

881
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Suggesting that a false flag could happen

882
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:02,111
You really got the sense that you took that personally but now I guess you realize the state department was right

883
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
But Woody's

884
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Failed to take

885
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Stalk of

886
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
Is that he was wrong

887
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:11,327
He'll never do that because if he acknowledges that he's wrong or that there's a decent chance he could be wrong

888
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,887
Keep losing a lot of hypnotic power over the audio

889
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,959
So much of Alex's appeal is based on his performance

890
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,263
Confident so if that facade cracked

891
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
He doesn't really have much to offer people other than bad impression

892
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,431
Leaving aside the question of whether or not there were in fact false Flags

893
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,503
It's weird how Alex can accept it Rush identify

894
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,063
False flag but not draw the natural conclusion

895
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
Putin is evil

896
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,999
Evil leaders do false Flags according to Alex at Infowars being honest honorable leader

897
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
False flag but here Alex seems to take the whole thing pretty lightly

898
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:50,751
Doesn't do it then you're just out of gray you're just don't even know what you're talkin about

899
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,847
I still don't think

900
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,943
Define the idea of a false-flag wanted to look like the good guy

901
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,759
Two car bombings to make it look like they were I guess

902
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:08,159
Alex won't take me very short very obvious step of recognizing that it said they are the bad guys

903
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:12,767
The good guys

904
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
Because they are not

905
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
The good guy

906
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:21,471
Talk about false flag

907
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,287
It's always been okay stop by false flag

908
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
Does it talk about false flag

909
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,151
He calls everything a false flag with no

910
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,943
He constantly rants about

911
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
Vague false flags that are coming any day now

912
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:38,623
He uses accusations are false likes to excuse their behavior with murderers who are motivated by the same

913
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
Extreme right-wing politics

914
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
The Hughes files is on a daily basis

915
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
There's a lot of space between

916
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Response

917
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Possibly talking about false flags and what Alec

918
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,119
He is full of

919
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
See you can

920
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,311
Damn you can talk about false flag

921
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Alex

922
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:04,479
I think even more so then on our last episode

923
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
Yep since then Alex's

924
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
Waffly a little bit

925
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
He's not saying the Putin's bad

926
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Right but they were right

927
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
What obvious

928
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
Putin was right

929
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,119
I think Alex has solidified that a little bit more on this 25th

930
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,959
This is being done to look strong to go in at

931
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
Disarm Ukraine

932
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,799
Because Russia for 20 years has left the last

933
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Expand 805 times

934
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Very clear

935
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
And put the shed

936
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,919
2 weeks ago

937
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
I'm not going to invade

938
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
Just say you're not going to

939
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
Invoke Article 5

940
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
So you're not going to bring Ukraine into NATO

941
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
And I said nope

942
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,535
Images of large US Transport Aircraft

943
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
Delivering

944
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Palace

945
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
Very

946
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Structube antiaircraft

947
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
It's got one now

948
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,479
Wow you just said it was right for Putin to invade

949
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
That's that's what you just

950
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,551
So-vi

951
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,951
You think Putin murdering all of these people if he looked he believes it's saying was a cell

952
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,999
Self Defense Act

953
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,423
NATO promise Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union that they wouldn't expend is taken as an absolute fact

954
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
Will do accept it as a fact but

955
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
The reality isn't so

956
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Clear

957
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,943
It's definitely been the Russian government in Putin's claim forever but there's

958
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Story that make this

959
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
Incorrect

960
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
This comes down

961
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,855
Go to the. Right after the Berlin Wall fell

962
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Discussion happening about reunification

963
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Application

964
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,767
What are the big issues in the negotiation involving the US state department in Baker

965
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,607
I am Mikhail Gorbachev was whether or not NATO troops will be stationed

966
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
East German

967
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,959
USSR in Russia

968
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,007
Did not want that to happen at all

969
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,055
So in the past

970
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:10,687
Pointed to a May 17th 1990 speech from the NATO secretary-general Manfred Warner

971
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
Happy Day Dental

972
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
2007

973
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,391
What happened to the assurances our Western Partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact

974
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
Where are those declarations today

975
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
No one even remembers them

976
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
But I will allow myself to remind the audience

977
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,303
That's what was that

978
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
I would like to quote

979
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,399
The speech of NATO secretary-general

980
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,751
Mister Wok in Brussels on 17th of May 1990

981
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
He said at that time

982
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,335
The fact that we are ready

983
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,919
Not to place a NATO Army outside of Germany

984
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
German territory give the Soviet Union

985
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
Hey firm security guarantee

986
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Where are these guarantee

987
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,903
The issue however is that the speech that Warner gave.

988
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
Promise not to expand member states

989
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
Of NATO right

990
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:59,071
Just promise not to station NATO troops in the former East German

991
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,215
Even gorbachov is that they didn't agree not to expand in a 2014 interview with Russia Beyond

992
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,103
The topic of NATO expansion was not discussed at all and it wasn't brought up in those years

993
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
I say this with full responsibility

994
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:18,271
Not a single Eastern European country raised the issue not even after the Warsaw Pact

995
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,319
Cease to exist in 1991

996
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,367
Western leaders didn't bring it up either

997
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:28,511
He says expansion is against the spirit of the agreement but it wasn't discussed and no promises were made

998
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,863
The point is that there's a gray area here where Alex just sees black and white

999
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,399
In the same way as Boonton

1000
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:40,031
Multiple NATO States Estonia and Latvia border Russia and they joined in 2004

1001
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:45,151
Multiple former Warsaw Pact countries have joined the earliest entering in 1999

1002
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
Prior to Putin come into power

1003
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,247
Bring up NATO expansion is being

1004
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,039
The spirit of the agreement that was

1005
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,831
Tell me about Germany

1006
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,415
Is something that is a fine thing to do at a negotiating table

1007
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:01,791
What is absolutely not a justification for an invasion which is what Alex is using it here for

1008
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,375
He seems really desperate to make the audience think that this is the West

1009
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
Asphalt and that Putin had no choice

1010
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
Which is pretty f*****

1011
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
I'll bet that's where he's at

1012
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
It says

1013
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,079
That's how the cow ate the cabbage

1014
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,151
Man it's so it's so weird to me

1015
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Seeing

1016
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
How many people

1017
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
Are you like

1018
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Apologies

1019
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
For a war

1020
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,319
Yeah I was watching

1021
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,111
Chicken some of the America

1022
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
The first pack

1023
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,695
Conference

1024
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
Nickel

1025
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,071
Disease getting a round of applause there is great

1026
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,143
For Putin

1027
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,983
Their computer

1028
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,799
Pick some of those eight does

1029
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Believe some of that

1030
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,895
Stop but I think that kind of line is actually

1031
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,479
That was one hundred percent to get on

1032
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,599
I think I think he is also a dangerous horrible Neo-Nazi as bigoted but

1033
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
I think that was

1034
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,207
Verbal shitposter that was definitely him being like

1035
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
Guess what's going to be on TV 2

1036
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,583
Even though you was

1037
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
Expressing

1038
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,399
Quite a bit of support for food

1039
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Invading Ukraine

1040
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
Getting a

1041
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,007
Round of Applause and a chance for putia

1042
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,567
All sorts of

1043
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
Folks across

1044
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
The right

1045
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
It's just

1046
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Really

1047
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
I can't I can't think of any

1048
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
I can't think of any war that I be like

1049
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Well listen

1050
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
This is great

1051
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,647
I think this is awesome I want this

1052
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
It's crazy

1053
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
Crazy to me

1054
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,535
Yeah who's the who lives in that world of like

1055
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Yeah we're still cool

1056
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
I didn't

1057
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
So Alex

1058
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
Is really caught up in this

1059
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Ukraine stuff

1060
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
You know and it's so much so

1061
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
He's forgotten to cover some big

1062
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,175
I'm going to cover the

1063
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,503
Developments in Rochester for this segment the next

1064
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,087
But then the last second of the shower I really

1065
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
Drop the ball yesterday

1066
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,279
And this isn't just about this news it's just

1067
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,327
Unbelievable

1068
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,631
It had almost all the pieces of it but now we got

1069
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,191
Madonna created

1070
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Covid-19

1071
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,519
Reverse-engineered at the lab data

1072
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Coverstore

1073
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,919
Cork moderna was created by Bill Gates and others just

1074
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
For this event

1075
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:33,599
So this story that Alex is talking about has to do with another preprint article that he's blowing out of proportion in order to weave

1076
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Conspiracy Yarns

1077
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:41,535
The team of researchers who found that a 19 letter string of DNA in the coronavirus map

1078
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,095
Bring those patented by moderna a few years back

1079
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
In relation to a cancer drug

1080
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
They were working on

1081
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,751
Sure this was covered in the Daily Mail who spoke to Professor Lawrence

1082
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,567
Young'un virologist at Warwick University you said quote

1083
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,943
We're talking about a very very very small piece made up of 19 nucleotides so

1084
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,479
It doesn't mean very much to

1085
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Refract

1086
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
If you were to do these type of searches you can

1087
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
I always find matches

1088
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,159
Yeah it's a quirky observation but I wouldn't call it a Smoking Gun because it

1089
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
It's too small

1090
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,279
It doesn't get us any further with a debate about whether covid-19 was engineered

1091
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,119
Also Bill Gates didn't start but he wasn't even involved in the venture

1092
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,911
For Capital start-up for the company back in

1093
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
In 2010

1094
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:25,567
Even within the study that itself they suggest ways that this could have happened naturally and there

1095
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
Conclusion is just that

1096
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
It's something that should be looked into

1097
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
That's fine

1098
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
It doesn't

1099
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,479
Justify Alex's reported on

1100
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Montessori at all

1101
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,831
Still get back to it a little bit later but you just had to be like flakka

1102
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,671
I forgot to cover that this is so important this thing that's not true

1103
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,023
I got to get this out there smoking God

1104
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
Open the garage

1105
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
But first you know we'll get into that

1106
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
Giraffe stuff we'll talk about why why your neck so long what are you hiding

1107
00:51:55,263 --> 00:52:01,407
What are those leaves and they better than the ones I got you will lead us giraffe

1108
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
More about Russia

1109
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Globalist

1110
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Never give up

1111
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,319
And they're really pissed it Russia or not

1112
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,647
And so they are pushing Russia

1113
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
Add

1114
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,559
Understand

1115
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
Global system of setting

1116
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
War

1117
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
And defeat

1118
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
But

1119
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
Put made a major mistake going into

1120
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Ukraine

1121
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
And

1122
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Long-term

1123
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
Trigger alarm

1124
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
I understand that it was

1125
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
And one of the choices out of list

1126
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
The bad choices

1127
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,159
And I know you putting on

1128
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Baby born

1129
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
Just analyzed

1130
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
Wow

1131
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
Sweet kind of see here how the only way Alex could be

1132
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,911
Anyway critical of the invasion is to put it in

1133
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
Tactical terms

1134
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,751
You have nothing to say about the targeting of civilians

1135
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
Possibly bads

1136
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,079
Strategic decision food made today

1137
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,431
Who knows maybe I'll be a good thing in the end

1138
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,223
Missiles

1139
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
Directly into kindergarten

1140
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Hospital

1141
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
All of that stuff

1142
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,111
That is just

1143
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Bad

1144
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
Strategy

1145
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
Not evil

1146
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,535
You just got to do it better there's a real

1147
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,631
I don't I don't know how to describe it other than

1148
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
Lack of Center

1149
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,239
There is there is a little bit of that like

1150
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,031
Oh he's watching a TV show

1151
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,335
He's watching a TV show and he's like

1152
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,383
If I were the head

1153
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
Main character in this show I wouldn't do that

1154
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:42,271
I mean he's he's like I don't go don't go in there

1155
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:48,671
Don't go in there behind the door is also imagining a killer being behind

1156
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,327
Everything's fake TV show isn't real he just staring at a big rock in a wall

1157
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,655
Sunnyway in in case you need to speak clear

1158
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,007
Enemy is the globalist the enemy is Hollywood the enemy is the left

1159
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
Heather moralize

1160
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
When are the worst

1161
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
People

1162
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,199
This planet

1163
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
As ever

1164
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
Yeah please make

1165
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,319
Can clear that those are the animes the enemies of Russia

1166
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
Yep

1167
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
That's just

1168
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
It's amazing

1169
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:26,047
It is it is kind of talk about this bunch of the past but maybe not reiterated enough

1170
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,911
Russia about the people

1171
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,215
Of the country

1172
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:37,055
Hey can be it can be easy to misconstrue

1173
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,591
It Bears repeating

1174
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,431
From time to time I am thoroughly anti-oil border

1175
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
So

1176
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:50,111
No Warner Waldo USA at all

1177
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,695
Send but you sure have a right to defend yourself of an army

1178
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,719
Shows up at your door

1179
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,143
I just I guess wanted to clarify that because

1180
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,935
Of my way of saying that like

1181
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,799
Alex thinking that the enemy is Russia I don't mean

1182
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,943
You have some really interesting event by that I mean dumb ideas about what's going on

1183
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
How with is engaged

1184
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,039
But you get around the average leftist they are

1185
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
Hateful

1186
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
Filth

1187
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
And never stop attacking

1188
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
Until they get control

1189
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,959
People on the world

1190
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,543
Russia

1191
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,383
The left has successfully feminized America broken

1192
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Donald

1193
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Didn't happen in Russia

1194
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,015
85 years of New World Order leftist rulership

1195
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,599
Is that we see the response

1196
00:55:54,623 --> 00:56:00,255
Was an outrageous thing for Alex to be saying at least partially because it's a complete contradiction of everything he said

1197
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
For the past week I mean

1198
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:08,191
God damn it was initially threatening to go into the Don Bosco regionality wasn't saying that he was doing that to stand up to sjd

1199
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,239
Do use he relied on Russian

1200
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,311
Compliance targeted Putin should do that and it's basically already

1201
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,335
Russia

1202
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,895
Even after the invasion Alex said to Putin

1203
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:20,735
Paid off the Ukrainian government and was going to have no resistance in his invasion

1204
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,807
The New World Order

1205
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:31,487
The effeminate men in sitcoms and commercials or whatever purple penguins are why millions of people have to

1206
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:38,143
Alex suggested that the fact that the US is tolerant of lgbtq focus that made us look weak to Putin at a past episode

1207
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
But this is a different Target

1208
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,959
Alex is making now

1209
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,263
This is an argument about Putin's motor

1210
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,383
It's where Alex's suggested that he invaded Ukraine because it was somehow a response to how the left wants to

1211
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
Control everything

1212
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,943
And feminize men

1213
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:56,319
Is a profoundly stupid thing but it's one of the only refuges Alex has to hide

1214
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:00,415
The Invasion is ongoing people are dying and all of his predictions work

1215
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,183
Complete s***

1216
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,231
He was wrong in the lead-up to The Invasion

1217
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
Eddie actually was wrong in both directions

1218
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,351
He said the Putin was just going to take done boss

1219
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Eddie also

1220
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,447
Was going to start a thermonuclear war with the United States

1221
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:17,567
At their parties are done both extreme psyche got a 7-10 split

1222
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Yeah

1223
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
In order to put

1224
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,967
Salve on his wounds and distract people thought that stupid video about how you predicted this last year

1225
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:30,111
And then he goes and he does everything he can to shroud The Narrative of the invasion in topics that he's more comfortable with

1226
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
Which is to say bigotry

1227
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Is it the audience

1228
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,767
Love those marriage just give them what they want

1229
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,839
More to the point though this isn't analysis of

1230
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Anything

1231
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,143
This is an emotional outbursts

1232
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,215
The ticking to use the invasion of Ukraine to inflame people's feeling

1233
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,287
It possibly incite them towards anti-violence

1234
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
Yeah I mean it's it's just

1235
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,967
It is it is literally like hey

1236
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,759
We can forgive

1237
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,527
Anyting

1238
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,111
As long as your aim is to Stamp Out

1239
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,159
The lgbtq community

1240
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
Like that's

1241
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Spizike

1242
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
Phuc yea

1243
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:14,143
You have to invade otherwise NATO's going to bring the lgbtq into your f****** c***

1244
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Like that's

1245
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,191
That's your argument

1246
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,591
It's it's not far off from the spiritual core of what he say

1247
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,919
Whatever you got to do man as long as we get rid of lgbtq

1248
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,711
You get a free lunch

1249
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,295
I am sure he would try and pretend that there are other

1250
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,391
Elements

1251
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Central

1252
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
Organizing principle

1253
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
Of what he

1254
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
It's it's awful

1255
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,095
I mean it's might as well be

1256
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,167
You know this hurricane was caused because we allow gay marriage

1257
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
That's that's

1258
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,471
It's it's just

1259
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,263
God has to visit

1260
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,543
Pain upon us

1261
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,823
For our sins

1262
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:58,175
So Alex gets back to this covid narrative

1263
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
Even

1264
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,271
Take

1265
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,367
Something and use the actual bit severe

1266
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,927
To make a conspiracy have to lie even about something

1267
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
We could just work

1268
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,143
Somebody seen this cuz the Indians I get the credit

1269
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Major Tom

1270
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
University

1271
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
Biogenetics

1272
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,287
Virus scan

1273
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,591
Completely man-made

1274
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,127
All the parts

1275
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
Play-Doh AB

1276
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,687
They're all come together there's something

1277
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,479
Next flight out with synthetic

1278
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
No debate

1279
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,879
One out of three million chances

1280
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,183
They just one part

1281
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
October 9th

1282
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,559
When you put all the pieces together

1283
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,631
It's basically impossible

1284
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:56,287
Flying first of all this wasn't from India's most prestigious or top university

1285
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,871
Researcher on it is

1286
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,407
Who's at the University of Oregon

1287
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Can in Eugene

1288
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,783
There's one researcher from India who works at Doctor shots charity Eye Hospital

1289
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,111
Second Alex is just lying about what this paper is about

1290
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,511
It's not about any other part of the genome been this strand of 19 letters so when Alex says that it says something

1291
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
But outside of that

1292
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,559
He's making that up

1293
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:24,703
They do calculate the odds of this string matching the string that was patented by moderna as being 3 billion to 1

1294
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,287
Remember that this hasn't been peer-reviewed

1295
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,335
And even just in the comment section

1296
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,407
Of the article like the actual

1297
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
Paper itself

1298
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:38,527
People that brought up some potential issues with how they calculated that probability

1299
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,879
They also didn't say that it had to have been made in the lab that's all an extrapolation on Alex's

1300
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:48,767
Is Bart there is even inside the story a or in the paper itself

1301
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
There is a

1302
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
Potential explanation for how

1303
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
It could have occurred naturally

1304
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Abso

1305
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
So yeah

1306
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
Newark

1307
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
It's very much not telling

1308
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
He hasn't read this

1309
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
He's just

1310
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,151
Cena headline

1311
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:11,551
The article that I was reading from his is from The Daily Mail and even this article includes the response today

1312
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,623
I had from Doctor Young about how this is interesting but it doesn't mean much

1313
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:19,487
It also has another quote from a microbiologist from Reading university

1314
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
Interesting coincidence

1315
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,839
This is Shirley entirely coincidental

1316
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,167
The real version of this story as reported in the

1317
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:33,567
Starting a Daily Mail article deserves their thoughts of a shrug and say how about that

1318
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
What is also lying

1319
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,943
And making up details so you can make it more scary for the listeners

1320
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,759
And make it more of a confirmation of his bulshit Mera

1321
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,575
So I thought this to be uncompelling

1322
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,391
So it even then our reaction to it is more like

1323
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
Who is Michael

1324
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:54,815
Like when you see a double rainbow we are like well that's unusual a double rainbow

1325
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
A very different response

1326
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,399
Panda so much news

1327
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
So much to hit

1328
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
How many are there

1329
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,103
Just now the full compilation

1330
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
But 7 minutes

1331
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,431
It's a pawn

1332
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,479
Banned. Video nothing

1333
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
Long

1334
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
It got millions of years

1335
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,159
On the internet right now all over the place

1336
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,231
Billionaire

1337
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
3000 there

1338
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
Came out

1339
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Byerly

1340
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
2022

1341
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
Incredible

1342
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
Why don't I just go ahead

1343
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
And

1344
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
Play

1345
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,927
A little bit more of this in context you navel-gazing f***

1346
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,511
Oculus

1347
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:00,863
It's not about we're that much news it's not about me taking a Victory lap

1348
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:07,263
That's not what I want you to think that by the way it's a Victory lap based on getting a lot of attention for a compilation of deceitful

1349
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,663
But I do want to play this uninterrupted for everyone to hear

1350
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,711
Put a piece of s*** every second

1351
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,783
I guess you don't have a lot of news to get to you know apparently not

1352
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,599
Anyway he tries to salvage

1353
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
A little bit

1354
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
From this

1355
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,975
After the after the compilation plays he has some interesting

1356
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
Rebuttal

1357
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,071
Sources information I saw everything going on

1358
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
February

1359
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
China

1360
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
Moving and rice

1361
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Because if they're going to move

1362
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,455
They're going to move together

1363
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,111
And now China is making more and more

1364
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Allstate

1365
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
But they also said that they

1366
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
They like Putin.

1367
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,351
Ukrainian president and talk about an armistice

1368
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
Demilitarization

1369
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:15,871
The media of censorship controls

1370
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,735
We're neutral so that we can move against tartar

1371
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
See what they say

1372
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:31,743
I got it for you Alex

1373
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:38,399
Probably inspired at least partially by listening to the compilation video realizing

1374
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,471
Entirely about him predicting the China was going to Nuke the US

1375
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
Annoying a maybe I should

1376
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
Explain that or trying

1377
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
Y'all make it not little glaring

1378
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
Jack's for that one

1379
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,943
23rd article in the washing

1380
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,247
Two times but doesn't say what he's claiming

1381
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
What he needs to repent

1382
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,111
This is about a propaganda Outlet set of instructions

1383
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
China there were allegedly leaked

1384
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,207
First being posted on the website China digital

1385
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,815
It's unclear from the original Source where these instructions at

1386
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,607
Totally came from

1387
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,399
It's entirely possible.

1388
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,703
This was just an internal corporate memo

1389
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,031
From the social media team at the news Outlet Horizon news

1390
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,079
From the digital times are

1391
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:25,247
In this case the author of maybe were laying specific official instructions or taking the initiative in anticipating the

1392
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
The desired course of cover

1393
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,343
Alex is a discount from the government

1394
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,719
It's not in the underlying Source material.

1395
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,303
News Outlet you kind of probably have a video for what

1396
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,375
What's good and what's bad in your boss maybe so but

1397
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:46,495
Still doesn't have justification to say that this one is directly from the government

1398
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
So the story Alex's covering can't even solid leak

1399
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,359
Confirm that this was something that came from the GoPro

1400
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,663
Instructions

1401
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
To be against Russia's invasion

1402
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,271
So they could sneakily do some invading other route

1403
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
This doesn't match the messaging of the instruction

1404
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,879
Is really just making up a lot of this

1405
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,463
Basically the instructions were to just not say anything

1406
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:12,095
Negative about Russia into news around social media

1407
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
I mean they've got a

1408
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,191
Full cooperation treaty

1409
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
So yeah that makes

1410
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
To be clear I think it's

1411
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
It's not good

1412
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,543
If this is authentic

1413
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
I don't know

1414
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
It necessarily how credible

1415
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
Please

1416
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,223
The sourcing is on this if it is real but I think it could be

1417
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
Jerk taco

1418
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,807
Snow socks that Horizon news be making rules

1419
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,391
Not post anything quote unfavorable to Russia or pro-western

1420
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,207
And they're being told to monitor comments on their post

1421
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
But this doesn't

1422
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,023
Match with Alex's reporting it all

1423
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:47,935
There's a larger issue to confront here and that is that Alex's rhetoric is directly in line with the positions being expressed by

1424
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,727
Representatives for the CCP

1425
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,311
From the Washington Times article that he's Alex's source

1426
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Quote

1427
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:58,175
On Wednesday Chinese foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Shan Yin

1428
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,991
Appeared to be following a similar propaganda script

1429
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,271
Do one of the disclose

1430
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,575
A to the one disclosed by Horizon news

1431
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,415
Misua blamed the United States for the price

1432
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,719
Criticism

1433
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,535
Quotes lately the United States have been

1434
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,863
I've been sending weapons to Ukraine heightening tensions

1435
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,167
It even typing up the possibility of warfare

1436
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
She told reporters

1437
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,079
Hockey question here is what role the USB corporative current tensions around has played

1438
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
Nisswa said

1439
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:33,759
If someone keeps pouring oil on the flame while accusing others of not doing their best to put out the fire such kind of behavior

1440
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
Clearly irresponsible and immoral

1441
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:42,207
I look forward to seeing how Alex explains how his coverage of the Ukraine invasion is directly in line with what supposed to be

1442
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,791
The result of the Chinese propaganda initiative that he's decrying

1443
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,607
I also know damn well he's not going to deal with that at all

1444
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
Now I can polish it

1445
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Which is

1446
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
Which is

1447
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
Really strange

1448
01:07:53,983 --> 01:08:00,127
No not that strange it would be but it's obvious if you think about it

1449
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Pretty strange

1450
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,175
Just because

1451
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:08,063
Your people are acting on consistent like principles

1452
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,855
Awesome

1453
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:14,207
He signed the Treaty of cooperation with China and China is now just

1454
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,279
Giving out all this propaganda that helps Putin

1455
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,351
So evil of China

1456
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
And you like wait

1457
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
What

1458
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
What's happening

1459
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:28,799
Yeah Alex could have given that statement that the Chinese foreign Ministry spokeswoman gay

1460
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:33,407
Straight up very similar to

1461
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
What a dick

1462
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,223
Anyway Alex takes

1463
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
Some calls cuz he had so much to get to

1464
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
And

1465
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
Yellow

1466
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,111
This is the result

1467
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
Of the kind of

1468
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,183
Narratives that Alex puts out

1469
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,511
The day before obviously Alex was saying that

1470
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
Ukrainian

1471
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
Leadership

1472
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,607
Hey military have been paid off

1473
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,959
There wouldn't be any resistance right now it just gets parroted back to him by a collar

1474
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,239
I believe

1475
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,031
You're right on that everything

1476
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
I think

1477
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,871
Ukraine

1478
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,431
Invasion was a theater I think it

1479
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
It was

1480
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,247
Land II

1481
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
Putin basically walk

1482
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
True Ukraine

1483
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,647
There was no opposition

1484
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927
I'm sorry

1485
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,207
Very little

1486
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
What

1487
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,767
What do you

1488
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
Did he

1489
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,583
Does that guy think that happen

1490
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,655
I mean how you get that from

1491
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
Listening to Alex

1492
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:32,799
Talking point about there being no resistance and such

1493
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,823
That was a while back

1494
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,383
It was a day ago based on this episode

1495
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,943
The notion that it came to

1496
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,247
The past that's crazy

1497
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,807
Yeah it's just living in a bizarre

1498
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,087
Fantasy world

1499
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Alex

1500
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,671
Recognizes

1501
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,975
You know what there is some fighting going on

1502
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,071
I can't really pretend that there is not

1503
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,631
I got to come up with an explanation for why

1504
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,911
And here's what he's got

1505
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,775
Clearly the military leadership

1506
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Was Bob

1507
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Before the invasion

1508
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,151
It's a ragtag Pilots ragtag tank grapes

1509
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,711
A ragtag militias are

1510
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
Fighting anime

1511
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,295
In the face of the Russians

1512
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,831
Actually holding a mop and some areas

1513
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,647
Any other border guards they didn't get the memo to children

1514
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,695
To surrender so they got killed

1515
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,535
And admire these

1516
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
Fighting good people

1517
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,375
Upset about being invaded by their historic

1518
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
Brethren

1519
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,799
Interesting way for Alex to try and Salvage is shity storyline about there being no Ukrainian resistance but

1520
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,103
This is entirely pulled from his imagination

1521
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,895
He has no evidence or even

1522
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:46,783
Suggestion of evidence of the Ukrainian government has paid off to surrender as a fun thing to tell the audio

1523
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,599
Yeah be interesting if that's what happened

1524
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:57,023
Now that it's clear there's a robust Ukrainian resistance he needs to find a way to delegitimize

1525
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:03,679
So he's now making up but there was a memo that went around that the military needed to give up at some border age

1526
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,263
Scrappy Pilots didn't get the memo so they're fighting back

1527
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:12,383
Scrappy Scrappy Pilots Band of Brothers

1528
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,919
We happy few

1529
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,711
This is absolutely pathetic

1530
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
And it's really the face of Alex

1531
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:22,879
He's making s*** up to help his listeners and not experience reality that he finds inconvenience

1532
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:26,975
Even in the context of lying about people fighting a war against an invading country

1533
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,023
It's just debased stuff and like

1534
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,583
As the kids say he should probably just take the L

1535
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
I move on

1536
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:38,239
Do kids still say that I don't think kids do but coronavirus delts like us to

1537
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,287
Feel like I see it on Twitter and I assume that's

1538
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,871
Makita Twitter's the kids

1539
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,919
Nautica

1540
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:50,015
Scooters for old dum-dums like us Twitter is no longer on fleek

1541
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,551
No

1542
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,087
Thoroughly off fleek

1543
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:57,439
Bleek is nowhere near Twitter anymore

1544
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
This is a quiz about

1545
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,023
So

1546
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,983
Where can I deposit I love it

1547
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
Did this sucks

1548
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,871
And this is Alex's way of trying to get around

1549
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
The fact that this is not

1550
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
Come to pass

1551
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,991
The the lack of resistance

1552
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,575
How but he still wants to hold on to a lot of

1553
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
The leadership stood down

1554
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,463
Jalensky's hanging out with the fraud of frauds

1555
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Hollywood people

1556
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
And and and all the rest of it because

1557
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,375
Because

1558
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,423
Behind the scene for my sources

1559
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,215
Jalensky's actually a Double H

1560
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,055
I wouldn't doubt it wow

1561
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:50,687
Wow this is getting interview by Sean Penn

1562
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:57,087
Clearly has not left you've essentially created a folk hero level mythology about himself

1563
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,391
Ceramic is unwillingness to back down as a leader

1564
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:06,047
What else is saying is completely out of touch with reality and it's super offences at least in part because it's just Alex baking show

1565
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,863
Get up in order to pretend that they real-world matches is

1566
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,399
Conspiracy world

1567
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Which is very dumb

1568
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
A dumb world

1569
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:18,847
Yeah this is not letting the truth and reality leave your coverage is having a predetermined conclusion and literally ignored

1570
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Ignoring the truth

1571
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,919
And making up your own false reality

1572
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,479
So you can protect and maintain your predetermined conclusion

1573
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:30,367
It's abusive to the audience and it's pretty much all Alex can do cuz it's politics suck and he has nothing to offer in terms of

1574
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,719
Information on here too and I don't believe that it

1575
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,511
Necessarily

1576
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,815
Bully what's motivating this

1577
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
Zelensky

1578
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,423
Is really doing some great PR were

1579
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
And

1580
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,239
That's a threat

1581
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,775
Do Russia and Beyond

1582
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,359
Yeah is there food and standing in the world

1583
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,639
Certainly is threatened

1584
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Bye

1585
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
Image of

1586
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,503
The leadership

1587
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
That is being

1588
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,831
Exhibited by zelensky

1589
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,415
And I do think there is a slight piece of this that is trying to

1590
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,463
Tarnish or create like

1591
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,511
So it's all it's all fake

1592
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,327
Sure and I think that there is there is a part of it that is

1593
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,887
In in in service of trying to

1594
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
Retain some image of Buddha

1595
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
At least

1596
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,263
It is much as ours has invested in that is like

1597
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
The champion against

1598
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,823
I mean

1599
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,103
There's no way

1600
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,175
For you to continue saying that Putin is

1601
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,455
The champion of the globalist

1602
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,503
After he

1603
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,295
Didn't just start a war

1604
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,343
And try and take over a country

1605
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
But also

1606
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
Lost

1607
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,463
Where is is is a loser

1608
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,047
Well it's hard for a strong man to look strong and

1609
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,399
Especially whenever the guy that you're going up against is

1610
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,679
Theoretically

1611
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:53,311
Just a comedian actor

1612
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,639
The Mystique or the power behind

1613
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:03,039
He's just some guy I just won't f****** give up and to be clear you know we're recording this middle of the day on

1614
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
On Sunday

1615
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,599
Anythink

1616
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
Could happen it's not the same

1617
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,487
That there is a end to

1618
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,047
So we do not know but they're material advantage

1619
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,583
Just so I think

1620
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,143
That you can still say based on

1621
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,703
Just about everybody's expectations

1622
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,543
The notion of Russia trying to invade Ukraine

1623
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,079
I did not working

1624
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,127
Dim the first couple days

1625
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,151
Is a win

1626
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,455
In terms

1627
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,735
Turn of events

1628
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
Chef

1629
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:39,647
It's supposed to like literally losing

1630
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,951
He has not taken over the country easily

1631
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,511
Yeah is a law it is it is

1632
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,815
The loss of what his

1633
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
Been his most powerful weapon

1634
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Open witches

1635
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
He looks like

1636
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,423
Like he's the

1637
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,191
F****** most

1638
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,751
Evil supervillain strong man in the world

1639
01:15:55,007 --> 01:16:00,639
And he does whatever he wants without anybody getting his way and he can make people disappear whenever he wants

1640
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
And guess what

1641
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,967
If you can't do that

1642
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,759
You don't want people to find out

1643
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
Yeah it is

1644
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
It hurts

1645
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,671
Almost said Charles Schwab

1646
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:20,095
Charles Schwab

1647
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,143
I've been here

1648
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:26,495
Close Schwab on the other hand he wants to kill every

1649
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
And I know

1650
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:31,103
You want to go watch a movie you want to go play pool you and delete you

1651
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
Enchiladas are steak

1652
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,431
Want to go for a hike

1653
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
What's fun around the local pool

1654
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
You're not clock swap he wants to kill you

1655
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,671
He sees you living on his land

1656
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,487
They stole the world your fraud and they want us

1657
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,815
And if we let them kill us we deserve it

1658
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,399
Survival of the fittest

1659
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,935
I don't think he's a fetish

1660
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,239
Our species should act like

1661
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,543
I think he's with his he's not us

1662
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,567
What do you think

1663
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,151
You want us to die buddy boy

1664
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,455
Well the words of a pallet

1665
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,735
13 no

1666
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
No

1667
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,831
No you will die

1668
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,671
Politically

1669
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
Defeat

1670
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Until your ideas

1671
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,535
Play

1672
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
Murdering cell

1673
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,031
Wonder if that's an intentional strategy

1674
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:38,431
Alex uses to incite his audience towards violence while simultaneously providing cover for himself in terms of plausible deniability

1675
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,527
I do appreciate

1676
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,087
I do appreciate when you see

1677
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,135
A fiction writers hands behind

1678
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,951
A character's motivation what are he's just like

1679
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
Charles Schwab

1680
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:57,631
Cars Plus I broke the dam

1681
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
Call job

1682
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,191
Thanks it's okay

1683
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,751
If you just sit down and let him kill you

1684
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
That's fine

1685
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
Now I think that too

1686
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:11,967
And then he only thinks it because you'd like it Alex thinks it is you don't like back then

1687
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
You deserve

1688
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:16,063
Because Alex thinks that

1689
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,463
Also cause Rob as Lightning

1690
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,815
You have to be real strong with the dark side

1691
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:32,703
Boo-boo poopoo Odessa breaking news alarm

1692
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,727
What would happen

1693
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,567
I heard it but I thought it was the fire alarm

1694
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,103
What is the breaking news

1695
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,919
An article has just been posted on natural news

1696
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:48,319
Cam

1697
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:54,719
Yes you share it

1698
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Complete

1699
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,143
It's by white hats

1700
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,751
20 + in one area 30-plus in another

1701
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
The kill the Spy

1702
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Myprotein

1703
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Week

1704
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,663
And I give you a minute

1705
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,943
Spike protein

1706
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,479
Very sophisticated

1707
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
Weighing beholder

1708
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
Moderna

1709
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
16

1710
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
Come out

1711
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
And Angela

1712
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,975
Nothing like

1713
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:34,655
Well I'm glad I can't wait for this great fall apart now.

1714
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,447
This is part of his narrative future cuz it's

1715
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:40,543
So dumb just never going to talk about this one again so good guys

1716
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,335
Yeah in the

1717
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,615
Virus

1718
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,407
Creating community

1719
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,711
White hats they made Alma

1720
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,735
Macron

1721
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:53,087
As a way to provide immunity for everyone

1722
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:55,647
Wow with the same type of killing the spike protein

1723
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,695
I guess that means acures the

1724
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,535
Disease cure disease

1725
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Right

1726
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,351
There's a vaccine disease

1727
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
Curing

1728
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
Disease X

1729
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:10,239
But I wouldn't believe this if I hadn't heard it from the health Ranger

1730
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,152
What kind of dumb white hat hacker

1731
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,736
Are biologist or whatever virus creator

1732
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
Alright alright

1733
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:26,368
I won't reveal that the whole thing is Eve

1734
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
Destabilizing

1735
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,928
I will just make

1736
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,720
Dramatic

1737
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:37,120
Movie asked version of the disease itself bit towards the disease being a team for two people

1738
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,912
Of them is like oh my God

1739
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:45,312
I must alert the media and the other one grabbed him by the shirt collar

1740
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:49,152
This is the plot of Cowboy Bebop the movie

1741
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:55,808
They're nanomachines that kill people and then they're like we got to stop this so they make nanomachines

1742
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,344
To stop the nanomachines

1743
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
It's the same f****** thing

1744
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,184
Thought maybe I was branching out

1745
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,048
Syfy Cowboy Bebop soundtrack

1746
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,608
So what's this point

1747
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
Boudain

1748
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
Made a call

1749
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,520
For the Ukrainian military to

1750
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
Performative

1751
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,080
Yes

1752
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,360
Swing

1753
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:23,712
Sagami with level swing right there

1754
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,272
Look at this Reuters article that's out right now

1755
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
Bars at Bloomberg

1756
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:31,392
Calls on Ukrainian military to seize power to better negotiate with Russia

1757
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,184
Casinos it's a bunch of bubbles

1758
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,024
A bunch of former presidents jockeying for control

1759
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,840
Military which is a very smart move

1760
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,656
Just be over in 48 hours what do you think

1761
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,936
Wow wow

1762
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:50,336
So first of all Alex's Putin going on TV and asking the Ukrainian soldiers to turn on their government and overthrow zelensky

1763
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:54,432
Military coup

1764
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,968
Secondarily though

1765
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,552
How does he simultaneously expect this to be over in 48 hours

1766
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:06,208
There's a thermonuclear war coming please known since the last year there was big move the China

1767
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,488
We're going to make the Takeover

1768
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
Seems like these two things are

1769
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
Contradictory

1770
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
Because they are

1771
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:16,192
Alex has no attention span just gets caught up in talkingshit so when

1772
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,240
This caller is in the contact

1773
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:27,968
Loses track of the other ship that he said he starts floating stuff but I was going to end in two days right

1774
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,808
On one hand this is the byproduct of Alex not preparing it all

1775
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:35,136
And having no actual position on thing pass knee-jerk reactions

1776
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,928
And Hyper Oppositional defiant

1777
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,792
On the other hand it's also part of an intentional strategy to overwhelm the audience

1778
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,816
With nonsensical

1779
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,352
And self-contradictory position

1780
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
So they can't possibly

1781
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,936
Keep track it was actually being set on the show

1782
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,240
Except for the feelings but Alex creates a

1783
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:57,408
We've listened to the past week or so the show and I can't really tell you what Alex thinks is happening or not happening because he's been all over the place

1784
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,688
He has no key

1785
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,504
Consistency except in terms of the feeling that you sell it

1786
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,040
He's selling fear

1787
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:09,440
And be all bad he's selling the feeling that Putin is right and is fighting against these globalist Boogeyman that Alex's train the audience to feel

1788
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:14,048
The information itself is constantly changing and being remolded with New Lies

1789
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,352
But the emotional core is really what he

1790
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,120
Reselling

1791
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
In terms of this

1792
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:23,776
Performance and you can see how excited he gets like the opportunity to riff with somebody's like oh that's a good one

1793
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:28,128
48 Hours what do you think

1794
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,176
I need to stop and be like

1795
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
How does this

1796
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,736
Fit in here would be the best

1797
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,808
And worst person to have in a writers were absolutely

1798
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:42,208
Also it's 48 hours later now in the war hasn't ended so chalk that one up on my compilation is rhymes

1799
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,744
Predictions of totally wrong

1800
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,768
You got a longer

1801
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,560
It's not

1802
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120
600 episodes

1803
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,144
Going to say it so long

1804
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,704
Gaston

1805
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,776
Royce White

1806
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,592
Who's a farmer basketball player

1807
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,920
He's a running for congress in Minnesota

1808
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,760
Royce White charges for 2 seconds I really appreciate him

1809
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,576
Coming on he just announced a few days ago

1810
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,160
But he's running for congress and he's super smart guy

1811
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,232
Ilhan Omar

1812
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
He's a famous NBA player and

1813
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,096
Mac guy are all that because he stood up

1814
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
4

1815
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,192
Everybody and against tyranny and against

1816
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,728
The Democratic party and against

1817
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,568
Chinese, National leaguer

1818
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:36,992
Two things I need to make totally clear at the first is that Alex doesn't give a s*** about the weeders Edith pretend

1819
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,528
Optitex Chinese government

1820
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:42,880
He said on the show in the past that he doesn't care what the Chinese do them if China would just leave him alone

1821
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:48,768
The second thing is Doris one of Mike lindell's pillows if it was running against Allah Tomar so I don't know

1822
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
If I care

1823
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,608
I don't think this is going to be good

1824
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:57,216
For whites campaign to show up on Infowars and this interview could go severely off track

1825
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:01,824
If the topic of racial Justice and White's position on George Floyd comes up

1826
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:02,848
Husky and Alex

1827
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,128
See eye-to-eye on the

1828
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,152
They tend not to

1829
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,432
Here's the deal

1830
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:10,784
Roy's doesn't have a chance of unseating Omar as a republican which is how he's running

1831
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:16,928
Minnesota's 5th District is a Democrat + 29 District so in order for Republican to win

1832
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,232
You'd have to basically be running unopposed

1833
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:23,840
Have you even though Omar gets a lot of s*** from the right-wing media she's pretty popular in the home District

1834
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,656
You though because there's

1835
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
Chaos Brewing

1836
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,984
In the Minnesota 2022 midterms

1837
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,568
There was a chance that we could have gotten a shot

1838
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,616
Because there was a fight going on over rediske

1839
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:41,504
Scripting been resolved in time Minnesota was talking about having to have an at-large election

1840
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,040
Where the political parties put up a

1841
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,088
What field they feel the Slate of candidates

1842
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:48,416
I'm on the top nine vote-getters of all of the candidates woodwinds

1843
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,696
Seats in the House

1844
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
In that situation he

1845
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,304
Could possibly have 11 of them along with Omar but

1846
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,144
From everything I can tell the redistricting has been resolved so that process

1847
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:58,912
Being done

1848
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:04,544
There's no chance of the fifth district has it doesn't help the Republic

1849
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,616
If we wanted to win

1850
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,432
He should have ran against Omar in the Democratic primary

1851
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:17,344
He has widespread name recognition as a former NBA player and those she's won her to Democratic primaries by date

1852
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,112
Margins

1853
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:21,440
Omar is a bit more vulnerable there than she is in the general like

1854
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:27,072
This appears to be another Doom Congressional candidate showing up on Infowars where Alex will alter

1855
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:31,168
Smelly create the impression that they're so far ahead in the polls and the only way they can lose his cheating

1856
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:36,288
Remember losing Alex will forget about this game until the next election cycle where it'll repeat all over again

1857
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:40,896
Yep that's fun after he loses right will never be heard from again on

1858
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:45,760
No that didn't happen

1859
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:49,088
Laura lubbers name can't possibly be

1860
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,904
We ordered only by Rogers.

1861
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,768
I'm sure roses going to have a job

1862
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,584
He actually has far more in

1863
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,448
To Alex's narratives than I would have hoped

1864
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:10,336
That I was looking up I don't I don't know much about him but he was an advocate for mental health

1865
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
Issues

1866
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:18,016
It is time of the NBA and then he have some involvement with protests in the wake of

1867
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,040
George Floyd killing

1868
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:22,368
Until I kind of had this thought that like I maybe this is

1869
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,392
Just a guy who

1870
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,976
Don't know what he's getting into gogani pool immediately like

1871
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,024
I was a huge 40 no

1872
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,792
Yep

1873
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:33,376
Like when we had krs-1

1874
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,424
So a big interview itself

1875
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,960
I don't really care about all that much

1876
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,544
But there are a couple things said by Alex

1877
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,128
He's trying to argue that

1878
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
Needs to be

1879
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:48,480
In the in the house deleted

1880
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,784
He he he realizes that he's

1881
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,112
Complaining about ilhan Omar and AOC

1882
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:57,184
We have to start to be like I don't want no women

1883
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
Flower

1884
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,000
Mexico's a tickets out of control

1885
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,328
And you know women are great bunch of women in Congress

1886
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,888
And the day we need men to be men again

1887
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
Do magic carpets for men

1888
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:11,264
White Noise White Royce White. Us

1889
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,288
Imagine

1890
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:16,384
Why does Mad Men again

1891
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
I need men

1892
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,736
To stand up and realize it's their response

1893
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,760
Ability to be leaders

1894
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,784
It's a genetic

1895
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:26,880
Wow

1896
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,720
Most of the are all of the house and Congress

1897
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,000
It's really

1898
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,792
Let me let me ask you a question

1899
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,912
When was the last time that there was a female majority in Congress

1900
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,960
It wasn't it

1901
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
20

1902
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,752
2018

1903
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:55,040
Female majority

1904
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:59,392
If it wasn't for the genetic genetics I forgot about them

1905
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,976
Everytime I go I can't help but lead something

1906
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:09,376
Every time I've been in Walgreens I've led a revolution

1907
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:15,008
Music Man 76 Trombones man I got them out there

1908
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,848
How much does a few more thoughts on this subject that are

1909
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Yeah it is

1910
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:25,760
It's deeply deeply misogynistic

1911
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,832
And women have their office and women could really want

1912
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,696
Women want men to lead on average one

1913
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,720
A bunch of power

1914
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,560
And any system that sells women being in charge

1915
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,400
Doesn't really want women in charge

1916
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:49,056
You are the one who just said you wanted more women in Congress

1917
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:55,456
Idea that he does what he wants to give lip service today

1918
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
Don't want no women

1919
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:03,648
But yeah if women are in charge that the really just some nefarious plot by another man want somebody to

1920
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,672
Push around

1921
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,464
Abuse based

1922
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,280
Worldview

1923
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,584
I bet

1924
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
That's allowed

1925
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:17,216
I mean that's some Cro-Magnon man s*** right there that's

1926
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:23,104
Well I mean obviously I have a larger Club so I can hit you so I'm the leader it's also

1927
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,128
Scared

1928
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,920
Call terrified

1929
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,944
Speed skater

1930
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:33,344
That's what he's expressing what if women take over and all of the things that I'm a man about don't become important

1931
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,416
Anymore

1932
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:41,280
So interview with Royce White

1933
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,840
He take some calls and then it's the end of

1934
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,608
The show

1935
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,888
That's pretty dumb

1936
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:49,472
But he does have one caller that I think is actually worth

1937
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,008
Worth bringing attention

1938
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,800
Thank you so much for holding

1939
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,592
Received

1940
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:58,176
Arizona your first up thank you for holding

1941
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
A Batman

1942
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,496
Swear to God

1943
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:28,896
What you going to do I'm not going to do anything I'm just going to enjoy it I'll be leaving to leave back

1944
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,992
I'm going to put my mic down and I'm going to smile.

1945
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
It's

1946
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,552
It's a foregone conclusion

1947
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,088
Anyway

1948
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,696
Head and things on that

1949
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:45,536
Call themself Mahopac

1950
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,120
I know Mick Foley's actually a good dude right

1951
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:55,520
Why did why is he showing up as mankind on Infowars

1952
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,848
No it's just a strange dude

1953
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,128
God

1954
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:02,432
Yeah so I figured

1955
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:07,040
This episode sucks in a lot of ways and traffic on 10th why not leave on a high note

1956
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:16,512
Whoever whoever he was just killing

1957
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,304
And he's revealed

1958
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,888
Too clearly that's he is

1959
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,448
Supporter of Putin's actions

1960
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,240
I just didn't know that Bill Gates

1961
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:29,312
It's created Moderne in order to facilitate

1962
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,104
Putin doing weight

1963
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
I really don't know

1964
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,664
Understand what are you even trying to get

1965
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
Well

1966
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:39,552
Seed NaturalNews is proven right but Omicron was

1967
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
Invented by

1968
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,600
Good

1969
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:48,000
Bioweapon covid-19

1970
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Would be a biome

1971
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
Just because

1972
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,912
Just cuz you believe the person who's realizing it

1973
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Thinks it's going to

1974
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,960
Be good

1975
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:00,288
Irresponsible

1976
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,312
Something goes wrong with

1977
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
Whitehat Omicron

1978
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:06,432
Bio weapon that's been released his against the Geneva Convention

1979
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:10,016
XX

1980
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:15,136
Has there ever been a 100% effective virus

1981
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,976
I would have made I mean like what exactly

1982
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:23,072
There's no way that you can make a virus

1983
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,608
It's like at Omicron

1984
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,680
I'm sure even if it's to destroy other viruses

1985
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,496
Without also eventually causing some problems

1986
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,776
Two people

1987
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,056
That's how

1988
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,872
Yeah but it was

1989
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,920
A good guy

1990
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:43,808
It's a stupid stupid I really want to draw sharp Oak

1991
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,856
I think we achieved that the

1992
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:50,208
The video that you posted about his prediction is full of s***

1993
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:56,096
And if you really Trace down the sources you see the the actual intentional

1994
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:01,728
Misrepresentation of the things that he said in the original episode in order to create the appearance of predictive power

1995
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,520
And now he's using that to gain

1996
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,312
More credibility for his

1997
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,848
Justifications

1998
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,896
Of Putin's invasion of

1999
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
And I think it's important

2000
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,712
And something that

2001
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,248
Should not

2002
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,040
Be forgotten

2003
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,880
Time goes on he's very much 100%

2004
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:23,232
For Putin invading Ukraine should be Albatross ship

2005
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,280
Around his neck so it should

2006
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,352
So he will be back in deep

2007
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,912
