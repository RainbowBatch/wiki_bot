00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
What was the last time you lost

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:26,624
I don't know if I've ever actually play 10 recreationally

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,904
Just f****** around with friends

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,464
Play play

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,096
I've never played that actually kept score

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
My buddy James desolation Williams

9
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,568
High School

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
Is really funny

11
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
CVS

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Williams AZ

13
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
Really funny

14
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,512
I don't even know what that means

15
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,608
So when we're in a little glass enclosure

16
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
Hazmat

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
Look my name is just a box

18
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,592
Rich people have business meetings while they sweat

19
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Losing record

20
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
Alright

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
The best players in the world

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
You at tennis and I know nothing

23
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
Bright

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,288
Before we get to that I thought

25
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Just to talk about our last episode

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,504
Shity veneer

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
No I don't think so

28
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,440
People who listen to it because of an argument about whether or not the New York Times

29
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
When should burn their source

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Yep

31
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Criticism that came back

32
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Instead of like a

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
Journalistic

34
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Different there

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
I still stand by my position

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
That you do much more damage

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Zen good

38
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,600
Ibotta

39
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,440
Like calming down like that was a rough

40
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
As far as being alive is

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
A little bit out of sorts.

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Yeah so I just

43
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
F***** up

44
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,592
I respect your ability to

45
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
I don't think any less of you for

46
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
I think people

47
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
The reason that I ended up leaving it in even though I don't feel good about it is that

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
I think

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
There's a value

50
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
For people to see that we don't agree about every

51
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
You and I

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
I meant later whenever Ivan

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Right right

54
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
But even beyond that people

55
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
Disagreeing

56
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Weather

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Gifts anywhere or not

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Being able to discuss

59
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Whether or not it's

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,576
A bit of podcasting we've ever done I'll say no probably not

61
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Hey man there's another further value in this

62
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Psychological

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
And that is

64
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
Feel great

65
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,072
Anxiety when I put out a product that I don't think it's very great

66
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
And I don't

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
Feel that very often

68
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
I feel really good about

69
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,104
To be said for like put it out I don't feel great about it and I didn't either

70
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
Great deal

71
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Sorry about that

72
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Greener pastures anyways

73
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
In theory that's that's my

74
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
Speaking of grapes

75
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,359
True Value Hardware

76
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
The new donors very about

77
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Thank you so much

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,319
Do you want

79
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
That almost sounded like a question

80
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
Michael Cera

81
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935
I don't think you so much there we appreciate it very much

82
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
You're not a person who has joined up with

83
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
I can be but thank you very much

84
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Show button

85
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
Are we would appreciate it

86
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Indeed you can

87
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Yeah

88
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Sojourn today we are

89
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
In 2009

90
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
The Tea Party

91
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
He has gone

92
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Nationwide

93
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
National

94
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Tea party right

95
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
27

96
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
2009

97
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Whenever

98
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,823
People of all shades of white

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Got together to really

100
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,711
I talked about were they mad at Texas

101
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Sounds more like a black guy

102
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
We've got some real interesting

103
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
Stuff to talk about today

104
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Stuff

105
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
I got some stuff I'm very excited

106
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
Good to get into

107
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
2

108
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
Start where we left off on March 2nd

109
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
2009

110
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
Through about March 4th

111
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
I'll be honest

112
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
The halfway through March

113
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:10,943
We're going halfway through the show and walked away from it

114
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,295
It's not that it's bad I was just like there's a point

115
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
The show gets too at some point

116
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Okay

117
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
2009

118
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
I just kind of like I felt High

119
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
A little bit

120
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
Biggest show me so little sense

121
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
Later I'll go back and listen to rest of the

122
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Before anything else

123
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Amend

124
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
Addendum I will do that

125
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
For now

126
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
March 2nd

127
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Through

128
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
Half Price Books

129
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
But it was the equivalent of a listening to

130
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Somewhat

131
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,879
Start

132
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
Martial law

133
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
Alright

134
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Alright

135
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,919
Conditional statement

136
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,759
Should we defeat the New World Order

137
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,415
Never we will never

138
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Far enough

139
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
He's going to drop some little brown baby

140
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,911
What is it is this like every 10 yards brown baby is this like a football match

141
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Football match

142
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Very weird

143
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
I will say that was apart of where I am

144
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Turn it off

145
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
I believe that entirely

146
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,503
I will start here on the 2nd

147
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
I believe the last time we were in 2009

148
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
I mentioned it Bob Chapman

149
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
Yeah and Bob Chapman mentor

150
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
George Soros

151
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
And I predict

152
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
Hey I bet

153
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Start talking about

154
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
George Soros

155
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Shockingly

156
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
Here on March 2nd

157
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,383
Play

158
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
It's for George Soros Club

159
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
George Soros admits

160
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,415
Elite plunging oil to bankrupt Middle East

161
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
Email is missing

162
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
So is it a couple of verisign points

163
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
But I think are appropriate

164
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
To make here the first is that

165
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
This is still not

166
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,983
His normal George soros's run

167
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
He still isn't like on the George

168
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Zoroaster

169
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
I'm not satisfied

170
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,503
Because in this time that we've been covering

171
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
You know some 2000

172
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Do before

173
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
IR coverage

174
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Of this began

175
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,511
He's not talk about Soros at all this isn't the first time that he's brought him up as some sort of

176
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Evil nefarious

177
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
Familiar with sorrow saddle

178
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
Listen to the tone of his voice there it's like

179
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
This guy Soros

180
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
He's a headache

181
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,847
Soros Soros

182
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Anybody anybody

183
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Who Coronavirus

184
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
But I did find

185
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
Stuff about surisan oil in the end of

186
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
2000

187
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
Are you sure you didn't did you

188
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
Infowars site for like

189
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,935
With a bunch of exclamation points cuz I think that would have found

190
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Find

191
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,799
That you didn't find that no but what I find it

192
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Peace in the New York Review of Books

193
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
That goes over

194
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
Soros

195
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Us

196
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Committee oversight

197
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
2008

198
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
Give

199
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
Slightly amended version

200
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
To the house oversight

201
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Is that

202
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
You look at the

203
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Price of oil

204
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
How is

205
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
It's gone up

206
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Dramatic

207
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Increase interest

208
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Doofy

209
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
An average price

210
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
50 a gallon at the pump go up to over

211
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Over $4 a gallon

212
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
He's discussing about how this

213
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
Probably is representative of a bubble

214
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
It is a piece of like

215
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Overspeculation

216
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Can people over Trading

217
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
In commodities

218
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Is what's causing

219
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Nothing

220
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Or any of the other piece

221
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Places that I've been able to find

222
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
From around

223
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,223
The elites are going to plunge this s*** right against the idea that people are

224
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Amateur

225
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Getting an

226
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Piper Inn

227
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
Inflating the prices

228
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,719
And has nothing to do with the actual supply and demand of what a market would do

229
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,327
What kind of genius could possibly predict that

230
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Phineas

231
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
Like if somebody were like looking at

232
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
And I'm just going to choose something from

233
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Just at random

234
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
Like if somebody were looking at Bitcoin and seeing that price keep raising will keep going higher

235
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:37,343
And then buy their own Bitcoins there's no way enough people would be able to do that too

236
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,415
The bubble

237
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,255
Anytime a massive bubble is created it is probably going to be a crash

238
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
Too smart he has to be connected

239
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
To the elites

240
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
Well I mean there's some religious income housing

241
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
That would never happen

242
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
Interesting

243
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Address

244
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
For the

245
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Oversight

246
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Alex

247
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
Prima facie case

248
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Against

249
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Nutritional invest

250
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Commodity

251
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
It's intellectually on sound potential

252
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Destabilizing

253
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
A particularly harmful as economic

254
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
When it comes to taking any regulatory measure

255
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
However the cases left

256
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
Regulations may have unintended

257
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Adverse

258
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Brinston push investor

259
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Further into unregulated markets

260
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Shiploads of oil which are less

261
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
Turn off Earl expert

262
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,223
He's making an argument but it's

263
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
You know these are the consequences

264
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
You see when people get it

265
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Irresponsible

266
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Commodity index

267
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Trading

268
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
These are

269
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
It's bad B

270
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
What you also

271
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Have is

272
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,143
Possibility

273
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
So even I mean all of this

274
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Should be okay with

275
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
Speech was essentially

276
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
I know this is going to go wrong

277
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
But I don't know how to

278
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
No no not at all actually

279
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Know how to sex

280
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Eerily reminiscent

281
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
Vestibular craze for portfolio insurance

282
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Stock market crash

283
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Institutional investors

284
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
The piling in on one side of the market

285
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Efficient way to on

286
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
If the trend reversed in in

287
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Institutions as a group

288
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
287

289
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
There would be

290
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
Index buying and speculation

291
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Fallas

292
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Reinforced

293
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
The prevailing directions

294
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Enterprises

295
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
Equalizing effect by aggravating to prospect

296
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
The effect will be reversed

297
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Only when the recession begins

298
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
To take hold

299
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Samantha Klein

300
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
But it would be desirable to rain in index buying and speculation

301
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Wow they're still in

302
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
Bubble

303
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Is right there is advice

304
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
Queer

305
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Buying and speculation

306
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,431
Yeah but he also said that he doesn't know of Regulation

307
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
Is the way to do but he's not even in that

308
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
Advocating

309
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
For regulation of their own accord

310
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Invest

311
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
I'm still not okay

312
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Time for regular

313
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
I understand and I think that maybe there is some

314
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
Could have

315
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
This is also very

316
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
George Soros

317
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Supply

318
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,063
Oil at all

319
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,623
I'm being very concerned about the

320
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Prices

321
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Annoying

322
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
The late

323
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Part of 2008

324
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Advise

325
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Call Moorhead

326
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Find a better way.

327
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Yeah and he didn't even know what

328
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
Terminator had the rise of the

329
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Had a chance now

330
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
You may think you may have Alex actually knows what

331
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
From bad to worse

332
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Ladies and gentlemen

333
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
Ladies and gentlemen

334
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
They are going to destroy the economy and then right at the point of peaceful Revolution

335
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,759
Joshua

336
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
Literally thousands of different

337
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
Police detective

338
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
And sleeping something

339
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
You get a very scary

340
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,431
Power of

341
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
Predictions didn't

342
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
Happened none of that happened United States are is real

343
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Got better from this point forward

344
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,535
Going to destroy everything

345
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Dissolve the Union as he's

346
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:42,495
Masturbating thinking about it

347
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
Mid nose is very off

348
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
But that's the Memphis that s*** that's why

349
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
1990s

350
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
Nobody knows who committed any crime before

351
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
We got computers in forensic evidence

352
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
That's very

353
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,255
Until DNA

354
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655

Perception

356
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
Actually I'm going to leave

357
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Ever

358
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Ever. What

Back on every every haunt you ever had

Oh yeah

362
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
Well if Alex

Hurrah reopen every Cold Case

Split everybody got it

366
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
It's called a warm case when it's solved

367
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
No it's not

368
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
It's

369
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
It's done

370
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
It's gone cold

371
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
It's got to be a middle ground

372
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Cases

373
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,063
In purgatory Olympics

374
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Hot

375
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
All right what you got text clip

376
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
Alex Express is semitism

377

About geopolitics

378

2009

379
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
Your thoughts on Iran versus Russia is this all just WWF fake wrestling grandstanding or is there really a threat there

380
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Yes

381
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
You think that's a possibility I appreciate your call

382
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,351
In Iran's mountainous North before

383
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
Technology consultant

384
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
Iran and starting World War 3

385
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Okay

386
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,599
Clearly Russia and Iran cool Israel

387
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
2009

388
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,255
Yeah probably

389
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Yeah

390
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
He wasn't here

391
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
Because

392
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Mechanic at the time

393
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
I still think of the text message wrong just because

394
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
I do agree that he's much closer

395
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,015
Ron's capabilities warrant

396
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
Defensive they were

397
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Nuclear program

398
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,695
I think is wrong about Russia

399
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Is more accurate about Iran and Israel

400
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,887
There's that but the only thing I find really all that

401
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
Thing is denoting

402
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
That hasn't changed

403
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
He also expressed

404
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
Neutrality

405
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,455
Everything is Everything is

406
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
We're still waiting on

407
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
As long as it's

408
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
For it

409
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
The moment

410
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
Fro

411
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Stupid

412
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Calls

413
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
Call from a guy

414
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
You should not need to be remind

415
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,287
The clowns are welcome George

416
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,615
Yeah just reminder listeners day is Texas Independence Day

417
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,735
Victory or death

418
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:42,623
Yes you know I was sitting there reading about the Alamo and I can tell you one thing I was on fire because

419
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,719
Even though they were outnumbered by the Mexican Army days they stood their ground and they

420
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
You know they all died they would not

421
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
Nada

422
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Dictator

423
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
And that's something that flickers and

424
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
What

425
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,495
Chicken nearby

426
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,503
Anil amount of media propaganda

427
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,903
And thanks for reminding me

428
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536

Texas Independence Day he's more of a only goes to church on Easter

430

Easter Christmas

431
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,312
In Texas booking Independence Day

432
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
The Texas Independence tattooed on his arm

433
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
Quite frankly

434
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,040
I don't remember

435
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
Well Arbor

436
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,696
Fair

437
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,792
But you don't make your whole life about like what are bird

438
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
Myself as an oak

439
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
3 million time

440
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,032
No but you have called yourself The Lorax more times than I'm comfortable

441
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104

00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,784
Interview with the guy named for

445
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,392
About from Mexico

446
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,464
Anti-immigrant

447
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,352
He's more concerned about the idea that Mexico is going to

448
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
And that is going to

449
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
Weed to everyone spilling over

450
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Into America

451
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
From

452
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Globalist

453
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Plans collapse

454
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Never heard anybody

455
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Or even

456
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Demonized

457
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
Entire country just

458
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
Immigrants come over that's

459
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,296
Crazy it's still so

460
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Then the current day version

461
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,904
Murder them at the border

462
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
But it's still so much

463
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
Generally other

464
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Still very different

465
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
From like places

466
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
Individual a f*** you immigrant person

467
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,824
So as far as I can tell George Grayson doesn't

468
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Seem like he's crazy

469
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,944
I looked interesting professor in

470
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
He's written extensively on

471
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Bartell's

472
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
Answer

473
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,184
What I would say probably is

474
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Is the big

475
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Question

476
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
And you might not get

477
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Let me throw this question out at you

478
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,448
Homeland security has shut in Texas both state and federal I've had

479
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,848
Quietly

480
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
Beers on wood highest alerts

481
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,296
Turn on air

482
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
They claim

483
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,000
Chance Mexico completely collapse

484
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
No Mexico's not going to

485
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
Collapse

486
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:20,736
Really really invalidating your knowledge

487
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
Pitstop I mean that's right up there with that volcano

488
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
No

489
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:36,864
Building a real life

490
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,216
Version of Rainbow Brite brought into this world from a text

491
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Cuz University

492
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
Can you respond to that

493
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
If you read it

494
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Okay

495
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:57,344
They were having a perfectly amicable interview

496
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
You going to say

497
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
You bet

498
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
They were on they were on

499
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:11,680
Similar wavelength about cartels taking over

500
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Patches of

501
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
Right

502
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
You can have a

503
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Conversation

504
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
It's just when Alex

505
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Start getting it

506
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Any academic

507
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Hold on now

508
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
I don't know about

509
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
It's just like you and me whenever we're having

510
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,880
Conversation

511
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,440
We were having a conversation

512
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
Sometimes I'm not

513
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768

514
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,376
Do you just keep going I have a heart problem

515
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
You shouldn't have asked

516
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,336
Bubble a lot harder to make

517
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
His information War bubble

518
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Moana

519
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Confronted with

520
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
Who's not playing ball

521
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,672

Yours

524
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
I think the last time

525
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
Might have been like

526
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
Was it one of our 2,000

527
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
Was it like a time travel episode

528
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
My2030

529
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:27,968

00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
The way back

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
Nevermind

That was just

535
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
We got to get Bill

536
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,496
The other thing

537
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
Like I said d

538
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
You know we're just sort of

539
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Tracy

540
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360

541
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
You have

542
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152

00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
Anti-israel

545
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
As I mentioned

546
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
Do a bit against the military

547
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
The military

548
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
People of Arabic

549
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
It is very weird

550
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,448
I mean Alex it is it's ridiculous the way I see people allowed people say well hey

551
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,008
You know you're guilty and

552
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,080
And it's okay to use you should be there

553
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
A patriot and let the police come in and

554
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,272

They're going to be

558
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
Government run by people

559
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:14,976
You are 100% right Alex

560
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,520
America's Best

561
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,104
Understand the Mastermind setup of this

562
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
Bank of America

Right that's that's what I guess he's saying is 2016

564
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,648
Damn that way they can't do it

565
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,560
Black president all the sudden they're going to mistreat Muslims and then they might mistreat you

566
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,168
Can you get a wife president mystery Muslims

567
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,496
I'm confused by that line of thinking but not so much confused

568
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,312
Hear it

569
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Vitastik

570
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Step back like all right

571
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
So

572
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,296
He's saying that the CIA put out all the information about Abu ghraib

573
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
To make us look bad in the world

574
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
What's going on

575
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
What are you going to do

576
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
I don't want them to not

577
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,096
Tell the world about that

578
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,888
A very serious issue that abuse

579
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
The prisoners in torturing

580
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Like that

581
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
Unique unique

582
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
You have to take your lumps

583
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Good

584
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:40,992
They had nothing to lose cuz everybody already knew it

585
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,088
Like the CIA can release all the Abu ghraib stuff they want and

586
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
2009 everybody in the world

587
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,976
Looks like you guys are f****** torturing people 3000

588
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,792
For I still don't understand

589
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:05,056
Questions you would like

590
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
America look

591
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
Looking good I would like for the

592
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,944
But it doesn't seem like that's what he wants either

593
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
I would like for them to have not

594
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
That's what I would like

595
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
Yeah kind of flies counter

596
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Whole thing

597
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,144
I don't know it's very confusing for Alex to be like the government

598
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
Publix

599
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
All that tracks from

600
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
What do you think

601
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
Especially hearing like all this

602
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,016
Pretty soon you're going to be talking about how the military

603
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
Some stuff like that

604
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
I don't I don't get where

605
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
I have my key

606
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
He said that before 2009

607
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,216
He's like

608
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
Symbol of authority in 2009 is

609
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,592
Associated with a government that the out-of-control

610
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,640
Where is now we have a government that is

611
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,832
Before that he started to get the narrative that there is a counter-coup

612
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,392
Beneath the surface

613
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,440
Globalist

614
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
The military

615
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,888
You know we talked we talked a bit about like why it's important to cover Alex Jones

616
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
Ford Focus

617
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,264
One of the reasons is because I

618
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
A lot of rain

619
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
Conduit into much darker

620
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,992
Now on another level

621
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,064
More mainstream things that Alec

622
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Save Fox News.

623
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
Service conduit

624
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
Which then lead people further down the hole

625
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Into like

626
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
White supremacy

627
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:09,728
It's like when you get lost on Wikipedia

628
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,848
You never know what you're going to learn

629
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
This is

630
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
This is something I would like to

631
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Is because

632
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
Towards the mid end of this episode

633
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Alex get the call who actually

634
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Expresses

635
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Exactly that

636
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
But as a

637
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Appositive

638
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Interesting

639
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232

Hey I just wanted to thank you

Or what you're doing

644
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
For the country

645
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
I believe that

646
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Your Patriots

647
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Thank you

648
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592

00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,872

Thank you sir

651
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
I just wanted to stay like that I'm new to all of this on YouTube politics

652
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
It's been quite an

653
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
Buy opener

654
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,816
Selection is what got me into it

655
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
My mom got me a Fox News up first

656
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
Let's do another eventually

657
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Found your show

658
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
And I

659
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
You've opened my eyes

660
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
Quite a few things

661
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
I listen to a lot of the

662
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,552
My radio shows out there just about all of them

663
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
And I think your

664
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Your

665
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
Truth daughter guide the Great

666
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
But it's like there

667
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Dared to

668
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
Talk about what really needs to

669
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,640
Just because it's fun Alex

670
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Blame

671
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Literally all the time by Glenn Beck

672
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
At this point in his career

673
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,600
Michael Savage calls him Michael weiner all the time

674
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,416
That's all

675
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,608
But if you see there that's

676
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Callers talking about

677
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
Okay so my mom got me watching

678
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,752
Fox News

679
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
When I found you

680
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,592
And then once I found you which is mostly like

681
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,712
Hardcore drugs the other stuff wasn't good enough anymore

682
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:34,112
Because you've convinced me that you are actually the one giving birth

683
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
They're full of s*** because they're full of

684
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
This is how indoctrination work

685
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
This caller is Express

686
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,280
Exactly

687
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,584
How the path downward work

688
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
That's a bummer

689
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,568
I don't I don't like

690
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,408
Politics

691
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
Did you all right fine

692
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:03,040
Winter

693
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
What

694
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:14,560
Alex Jones f*** man you know

695
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
People who

696
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
We aren't that smart

697
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Things filter.

698
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Really entertaining

699
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
Aristotle

700
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,064
I'll give you that

701
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
So dark.

702
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,768
Remember that terrible idea

703
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,328
Balance

704
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,704
When are you staying at least made the effort to pretend

705
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,288
What you got a tip the cab to a little bit

706
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
Or not do you know

707
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,640
You do need to tip the cap to this

708
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
Nice transition

709
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
We listen to a lot of Alex

710
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Joey sings along

711
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
With a lot of music

712
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,600
But we've never seen him become self aware

713
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,864
Alright

714
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,896
From now on The Highwaymen and then dropping just like

715
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
More fun my way

716
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:13,600
Studio

717
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Jason bermas

718
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,024
Midnight Show Network

719
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
I don't know how

720
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
The castle that was I don't

721
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
To find out

722
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
Jason bermas

723
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
Who is Jason

724
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Timberlands

725
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,456
Refresh my memory.

726
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
Like he's the guy who's made some 911documentary

727
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Who do Molly much

728
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
Character

729
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
There's nothing really about the Tea Party

730
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Really about

731
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
Except for that first week

732
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
Yeah it's boring

733
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
This is an omen

734
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Kind of hope

735
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
Find something

736
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
At least

737
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
Now so now we're in a holding pen

738
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,144
And we get to Alex talking about

739
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Sears

740
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
That

741
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Metastasize

742
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Becomes

743
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
On the road

744
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,152
Walmart managers

745
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:47,552
And 2000's Walmart distribution centers in Walmart

746
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:53,952
Under martial law

747
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,024
Walmart

748
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,424
Was helping during emergency

749
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Walmart

750
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
Vaccination drill

751
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,688
Walmart emergency preparedness drill

752
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,320
You shots

753
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:34,400
Then have drills

754
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Free flu shots

755
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,752
Bob

756
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,832
Walmart employees

757
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,928
All this is really just misrepresenting

758
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,232
The fact that they give that back

759
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,280
Walmart

760
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,496
How can we effectively serve the population

761
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,896
Huge ass building is it's a Walmart to Walmart

762
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,760
To consider how many Walmarts are in America and how many Walmarts are in

763
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,832
Towns that have no other Central meeting play

764
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
Like

765
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
If you didn't grow up in

766
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Small town

767
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
You don't understand

768
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
You live in the town where Walmart is

769
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
Town Square

770
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,912
Where are you hung out with my small boat

771
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,008
Has grown up the Columbia so close to a lot of small town

772
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,592
I'm hanging out with people who grew up in Mexico Missouri of Oz

773
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,408
Yeah I like those titties words like there's nothing

774
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Do except go to the f******

775
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Super Walmart

776
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:58,368
Go on Friday night kids at all go hang out at Walmart

777
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
Just nowhere else to hang out

778
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
So now there's no more

779
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Tavares

780
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,840
T.j. marks for Public Health

781
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
2

782
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
Work with Walmart

783
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
2

784
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,960
People sexing

785
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
But also

786
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
As opposed to the local Pentecost

787
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,688
So now you have to scroll. Every town has one of those Walmart

788
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
Mad baby.

789
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,576
Because

790
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Sacred

791
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
They don't need back

792
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
The snake

793
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
But

794
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
The important thing

795
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,328
Brand of fear

796
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
Is exactly what motivated

797
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
This is exactly what was behind

798
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Jade helm

799
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
Spear of a government takeover there all these Walmart

800
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
Close down

801
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,407
And people were like oh my God that's where they're going to have that

802
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
When they take over

803
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
So Alex

804
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
The present

805
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,599
It's been like I didn't get on the helmet

806
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,183
6 years before

807
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,279
If you are giving the Proto narrative that led to the Jade helm

808
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,375
So maybe I don't know we'd still have to go through that fear to time

809
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,447
Find out exactly what happened

810
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,519
We going on our next investigation is out

811
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
Investigation

812
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
Laying the groundwork for the

813
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
People who did make

814
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
The weather or not

815
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
He's a g

816
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
So that's fun

817
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,671
Anyway I mean a look

818
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,743
If I was going to put a lot of detail

819
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,631
I would rather surround them with a pit of snakes

820
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,911
Indiana Joe

821
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
Vaccines that way

822
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
You know how easy it is

823
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
To keep people docile in a Walmart

824
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,223
You never see people freaking out at a Walmart even at the checkout aisle because everybody has that

825
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
Easy to contain people there

826
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,695
Use lock the doors and no one would notice

827
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,279
I don't know if that's true

828
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
Readers would have a very different job they be on the other side

829
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,663
Peanut butter cups able to walk away from the exit

830
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Peanut butter

831
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
Free peanut butter cups

832
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,599
Like I said I don't know

833
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,839
You're working late last night and I went and picked up

834
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,055
Credit

835
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
But

836
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Can I have another guy

837
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:45,183
That's because right now I never before

838
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,815
Messianic Messiah

839
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
None of these people

840
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,679
But

841
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
Go to work

842
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
Continue a lot of those negative programs

843
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,591
It's a bummer

844
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Conversation

845
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
How big was this hot dogs

846
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,039
There were that many people

847
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:21,791
Hub of social

848
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Not a lot

849
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:32,799
Going on

850
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335
Alex plugin

851
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,151
Cuz I remember that clip

852
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
Spiraling into

853
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
The Obama Deception is going to be Mike Rivero on the show and visits only

854
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
Because

855
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
As We Know

856
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,695
Some point after this bike Rivera's going to

857
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
To call Alex

858
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
But she'll for Israel

859
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,583
Anymore

860
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
They're falling out having

861
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,959
I know who else is Richards

862
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
Cook

863
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,431
It's not important

864
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
He's just a guy

865
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
No he's

866
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,015
He's someone who I

867
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,343
You wrote about the Challenger explosion

868
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
Got to the bottom of

869
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Some of that

870
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,351
The fire about it

871
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,239
Vetericyn incredibly fascinating tree that's awesome

872
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
Goodbye

873
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Experience

874
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Economy

875
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
He's fairly knowledgeable

876
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
He tries to

877
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,967
Push a lot of

878
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
Do you like they're going to

879
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:45,759
Collapsing

880
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,087
Language

881
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
Cookies

882
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
Maybe a little bit more polite and generous

883
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
Conversation

884
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,327
Everything in order to

885
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
Have everything

886
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Be super cheap snake

887
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,423
I can buy up everything after it's all over

888
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,239
And that's the only way we're going to rebuild the channel

889
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,567
Richard cook comes in he's talking about how like

890
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,383
Historically when things have fallen apart

891
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
People are

892
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
Much diminish

893
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
Price

894
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
Puerto Rico

895
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
The fact

896
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
That you can

897
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
Things Fall Apart

898
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Does not

899
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
People do that

900
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Intentionally

901
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
He's so they can later

902
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,167
They're just predators

903
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
In order to

904
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,775
Not necessarily always

905
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
Force for good

906
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,127
Go with the large majority

907
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
Like literal carpet

908
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
You work things

909
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
Collapse

910
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
In order to buy things up on the other side

911
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
In order for you to get me to

912
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,767
That that was a larger plan by some sort of

913
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
Coordinated group

914
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
You need to do a lot more in terms of evidence

915
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
Yeah and when Alex brings up like

916
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Soros

917
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
It was he doesn't at this point

918
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
Conversation

919
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Hadn't happened years later

920
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
He f****** what

921
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,615
Also

922
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,663
The Rothschilds at Waterloo

923
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,687
That whole thing

924
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
That's not true

925
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
So like when your

926
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,623
Arguments about the idea of like causing a collapse in order to buy things up on the other end

927
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
Hearken back to vet

928
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
I don't I don't care

929
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,839
I don't got I don't I'm not coming alone with you for that right

930
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Ratso

931
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
You need to do better than

932
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
And I am courage

933
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,751
If you want to I'll listen

934
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,055
I'll review the evidence but up till now

935
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,711
There's not any actual example

936
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
Venezuela

937
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,831
Nimeni nacar f****** Hawaii

938
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:01,695
Like name any number of these things where I Collapse is created in order to

939
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
You purchase all of this

940
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,511
Are you going to prove to me

941
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Collapses were

942
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
I created

943
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
Whether or not it was exam

944
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
And then

945
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:23,455
Like you say predatory forces at call the banana

946
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
Like that

947
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
Right right

948
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,367
Like

949
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:35,999
Conspiracy orchestrated

950
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,559
Collapse a government

951
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,095
Then take it over

952
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,399
You know like that's a thing

953
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
It's

954
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,775
The problem is he's using a numb thing to describe a thing that's a thing

955
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
You see what I'm saying

956
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,871
Somewhat probably

957
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,687
Summation of Alex Jones

958
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Intellectual

959
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Strategy

960
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:03,647
Describe a non Thing by ignoring a thing

961
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,207
Talk about the fake version of the

962
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
Which is fun

963
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
This is the only thing that really was like

964
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,679
This is going to be fun

965
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
So that this is

966
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
First of all there's a lot of excitement

967
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:23,871
This is the first time I've heard Rob do on the show back in 2009

968
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
I love the professionalism of this just shows up after a commercial break and how

969
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
Alex is like

970
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,791
Private conversation

971
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Right

972
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Does weird

973
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
Kind of brings up the

974
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,983
Pity party he talks about

975
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,799
Chores

976
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,383
Yeah I'll tell the people that interested

977
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,919
Tax protesting is boring

978
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
No

979
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,015
No it's not like no it's not like to Alex

980
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,599
He has a very specific group of people

981
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:11,999
That he thinks are legitimate

982
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:16,607
I swear to God I would have ignored this entire clip if these names

983
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
Really funny

984
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,935
I bet I looked into them

985
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,663
Let's go ahead

986
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:35,807
Let's go and get all The Usual Suspects

987
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:41,695
The 15th is the middle of the week so

988
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,047
Transparency

989
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
What's Iran

990
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,079
What's good job

991
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,663
Who else should I get on here

992
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,991
Skip larousse

993
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:14,975
These are all legitimate researchers and activists in prison

994
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,839
There's a lot of Patriots apology

995
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
Appreciate that

996
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,223
So I

997
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
First of all I love

998
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Hello the name

999
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:44,927
Red Beckman and crafts crafts

1000
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,023
And then the idea that you saying that like there's Patriot mythology out there

1001
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:53,375
I wouldn't I wouldn't do wrong by bringing in a crazy person

1002
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
I like

1003
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,287
Irwin Schiff isn't on your list of names

1004
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
Leadership isn't on his list

1005
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
The attack

1006
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
I'm stopped so I had to

1007
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
I had to look into it

1008
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,503
I had to be like

1009
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,527
Who are these f******

1010
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,807
People what are they all about

1011
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
Cuz I don't

1012
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,879
Bring a little bit of a bell

1013
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
But most of those names I was just like

1014
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
That could be

1015
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
Larry becraft

1016
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,559
Do you know what my favorite Patriot mythology

1017
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
George washy

1018
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,167
806

1019
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,191
Season that's why we have

1020
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
The seasons

1021
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
His mom got sad

1022
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,615
I'm going to tell you all about

1023
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,431
Okay my research took

1024
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,319
Legitimate taxpro to hear about first

1025
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,367
Earthquake

1026
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,463
Unfortunately

1027
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
Baby crab

1028
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,167
He's a solid be crap

1029
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,775
Text generally working in the world of Defense

1030
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:11,199
In court mean that he himself is a sovereign citizen

1031
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:16,831
You're making money off defendants.

1032
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:21,439
But I'll tell you what he's rich as fuk 1985 becraft

1033
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
Defend one client

1034
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
16th Amendment

1035
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,071
Which allowed the federal income tax was

1036
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,911
Before ratifying

1037
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,727
The judge was not impressed

1038
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,055
Beecroft is now

1039
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,079
Was the judge

1040
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
Nonplussed by his argument

1041
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:44,735
Pressed

1042
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:50,367
Impressive to go all the way to the 16th Amendment

1043
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:03,679
Possibly because of his willingness to be flexible and try anything

1044
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,775
He's one of the only text protester attorney who's ever managed to win a case against

1045
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
The government

1046
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,359
Memphis legendary ship

1047
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:16,223
On October 15th 1993 Lloyd long under-representation from Larry becraft

1048
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:21,855
Represented by Larry name

1049
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:26,719
Is found not guilty in a criminal court on charges that he evaded paying tax

1050
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Use that case

1051
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,559
Is there Smoking Gun

1052
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,399
Swallowed long approve it to

1053
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:38,495
The only problem with their argument is that long only one is criminal trial

1054
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,031
For which the burden of proof

1055
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,567
Involve the government

1056
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
He knew he had to file taxes

1057
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
And the jury found that he sincerely

1058
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,807
We did not believe that he needed to do so not guilty by reason of stupid

1059
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
Not rule that need Wheeling Nevada Texas

1060
00:55:54,879 --> 00:56:00,255
Beechcraft even make sure of his defense in his opening statement

1061
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,351
I found an entire transcript before you read it

1062
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,911
I'm already trained pre-summit it

1063
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Alright

1064
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
Texting you too f****** stupid

1065
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,247
Hurt his sort of stature in the text protester world

1066
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,831
The question is did

1067
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Meeting with a

1068
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,927
The Criminal Mind

1069
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,231
Or

1070
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Belief

1071
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,071
A reason that he's done what he's done

1072
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,863
Now that's the bottom line issue

1073
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
No it's not

1074
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:44,031
So he's even trying to frame it as like he was really trying to commit a crime here

1075
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,943
Forgotten is like he's too dumb or he is

1076
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,247
Thoroughly convinced of this

1077
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,295
Not going to

1078
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,367
So also in Civil Trial

1079
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Found guilty

1080
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,415
Backpacks

1081
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,327
Who Among Us can say that we haven't murdered somebody because we sincerely believe them to be a dragon

1082
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,351
Haha

1083
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Crazy

1084
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,447
Do you really think this man committed murder

1085
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
No

1086
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
He farted

1087
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
Dragon

1088
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
Like a hero

1089
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,359
Well I mean

1090
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:26,783
Don't ever really talk about that

1091
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
Criminal

1092
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,415
It's like he got off with it because Larry be crafted coming in

1093
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,815
Work in Texas

1094
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
I read so much

1095
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,239
He's not really been too big a player the tax protest

1096
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,543
Yesterworld

1097
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,783
Also as of this recording the only post on his blog is just him saying contact him to be your lawyer along

1098
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,647
With a picture of himself escorting his daughter across the football field when she was

1099
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,695
I'm not sure that that's customer

1100
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,303
UPS Coronavirus

1101
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,631
What water is right to escort the homecoming queen

1102
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,823
Auto

1103
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,383
Billable hours

1104
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
Gonna guess that that was

1105
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
Like his idea

1106
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
I don't know

1107
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:33,599
Involved with family stuff but it seems like he was like

1108
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
You're the homecoming queen

1109
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,207
I'm motherfuking escort you yet

1110
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
No

1111
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,447
Alright so now I guess

1112
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,751
I guess we can go next Tom Cryer

1113
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Town crier

1114
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Tom Cryer

1115
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,663
He is yet another guy who decided not to pay his tax

1116
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,943
Got in trouble for it

1117
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
2007

1118
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,271
Pleated quote

1119
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,111
Need to do that using that as a defense in order to get out of criminal

1120
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,671
His story is the absolute run-of-the-mill for

1121
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
Idiotic tax

1122
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
Protesters

1123
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
In that world

1124
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,767
You got a bad sat argument

1125
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,071
You rely on technicality to stay out of prison

1126
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Civil court

1127
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Pay your back taxes

1128
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
You pretended civil case net

1129
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
Never happened

1130
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:26,847
Tons of money in the tax protest circuit preaching the people to do the exact same thing that you got in trouble for in the first

1131
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,223
You don't have to go to jail but you still owe us this money please pay it

1132
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,271
All hide behind that

1133
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,111
Sincerely believe this stuff

1134
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,647
Right so you don't have to go to

1135
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
Prison

1136
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,207
Pay everything back

1137
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,095
Regular

1138
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,447
From all the stuff that I looked into it had people wiggling their prison

1139
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:57,311
For the crimes

1140
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,335
Super super rare

1141
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
Because he was like

1142
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,895
I'm not going to beg.

1143
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:10,367
Just haven't beat being forced to pay their back taxes

1144
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,391
The publicity that game

1145
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
Ship the perception

1146
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Going to make it like

1147
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
I stood up

1148
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
To the man

1149
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
I meant just not talk about this

1150
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,655
12

1151
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,935
He decided to

1152
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,407
Agree that he owed back taxes news

1153
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:38,783
Any further thought that he shouldn't have to pay any penalties for wasting everyone's time and court with long debunked

1154
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,063
Discreditable

1155
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,903
The RS of the Odin that north of what

1156
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,999
Where is believed that the number should be

1157
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
Nice round number let's say

1158
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,375
1008

1159
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
Bring up the

1160
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,103
Dollar bill into everybody

1161
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,455
Joe Bannister hot name

1162
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,039
You know what I don't

1163
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,831
If you are making like a car

1164
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
Pretty good life

1165
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,839
But interested because jobadder is a former IRS agent

1166
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
You turned into a text protest

1167
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:30,239
And as if by some sort of magic

1168
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,311
He slid down

1169
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:40,735
He probably had some of these ideas in the IRS which is wild

1170
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,807
To be in the IRS file taxes

1171
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,367
2002-2006

1172
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
Trouble

1173
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:53,791
Banisters first real run-in with the laws regarding 1004

1174
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
Easter was charged

1175
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,887
Conspiracy to defraud the United States as well as

1176
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,167
Three counts of aiding in

1177
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
Assisting

1178
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,215
The filing of.

1179
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,567
1997 + 19

1180
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
T98 tax

1181
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,407
Cher now

1182
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:16,063
No that was just how I pulled the quote Adams

1183
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:21,951
You had to do with a client advisor

1184
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
A luggage

1185
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
Manufacturing

1186
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,839
Possibly due to banisters

1187
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,375
Incoming employment taxes

1188
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:33,727
And also stop filing necessary paperwork for the employees to be able to pay their taxes

1189
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,519
Correct

1190
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,079
Shrek

1191
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:46,783
Ddlc leave riddles and said that he just sent the baseball arrest

1192
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
These questions

1193
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,183
Free from that press release from the

1194
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,791
The indictment further alleges that there was a second meeting on October 11th

1195
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,815
2000

1196
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,631
Thompson and Bannister

1197
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,935
Cencal employees

1198
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,239
The compensation which they received was not

1199
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:10,591
They were not required to pay individual income tax on those wages

1200
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,871
Hold on

1201
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:15,455
Bannister sure the employees of cencal that Thompson would not like

1202
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Regarding tax

1203
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,759
I'm sorry what

1204
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
To do with this idea that like

1205
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,087
Vortex

1206
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,439
Protesters believe that the only people who

1207
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:29,535
The federal employees are the only people who actually pay taxes

1208
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,839
And the money you're paying

1209
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,143
Classified as income

1210
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
It's all a mess

1211
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:39,007
All right we could be here for another 6 hours

1212
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,847
There's got to be a little bit of that on you if I went to an employer they were like

1213
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,383
Don't worry about it

1214
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:50,783
What a penny with an income I be like you guys I don't think I should work

1215
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,159
Someone who

1216
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,951
Authority implicitly

1217
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,791
You could really they could really you have screwed some people over with like

1218
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:08,447
Remind me that guy works for the IRS

1219
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Except the

1220
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:18,175
Supposed to pay taxes on this look at that f****** guy

1221
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Take another step

1222
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,551
No matter what these employees believe or disbelieve

1223
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:28,159
Maybe because he believed with ancestors

1224
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,207
Stop pandering pointment taxes

1225
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,535
That's not good stops filing these quarterly reports

1226
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,071
Need to be filed in order for

1227
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
Employees to file their taxes

1228
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
Paperwork is hard

1229
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,215
Administrative leave f****** these people over

1230
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,031
Whether or not it's all because of

1231
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
Of course the issue

1232
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
Never just

1233
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
These people don't pay tax

1234
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:55,039
If you take the money

1235
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:00,671
Absolutely believe it always end up getting

1236
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,999
An amended tax return filed they were trying to make

1237
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,535
The tax liability for the business

1238
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,559
$0

1239
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:10,143
And reflect that they were entitled to refund

1240
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:16,543
$65,000 for both 1996

1241
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,127
130 thousand dollars from the governor

1242
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:33,439
Quit it because he's a member of

1243
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
The promoters

1244
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,767
Of a false and criminal ideology

1245
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
Tubalcain

1246
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,399
Jake Atkinson attacks lawyer who studies textbook New York Times

1247
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,423
It's hard to convince

1248
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
Promoters

1249
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,495
Promoters make a lot of money off their marks

1250
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,775
Watch their marks go to

1251
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,895
And then take advantage of the loophole that lets them prepare bogus

1252
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,943
Did they characterize as protest

1253
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,735
Return prepared at the direction of

1254
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
The client

1255
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
What

1256
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
What

1257
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
So

1258
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
He can get away

1259
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,439
As an advisor to the person

1260
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Who is Doctor

1261
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,815
Taxes doing this disorder

1262
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,375
Ask a question of the IRA

1263
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,775
Somebody should have stopped at by now or whatever and I just doing this

1264
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,799

1265
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:27,199
That the client really don't think

1266
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
At his Direction

1267
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,551
You get Santa

1268
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Slither away

1269
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,391
People like banister could profit profit off this way

1270
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,951
Week shift and he knows the when everything falls apart

1271
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,743
He can hide behind even week or arguments

1272
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
Either

1273
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Doing something

1274
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,631
Not intentionally Criminal

1275
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,727
Set the timer at the direction of his

1276
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:55,103
The 2800 fraudulently filed

And ODI rs.10,000

1278
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,455
Dollars

1279
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Appeals court

1280
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
He tried to take the matter to

1281
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
Supreme Court

1282
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,855
But they recently said

1283
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
No thank you

1284
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,415
Buy your own bulshit

1285
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:11,487
You can't do it if you can't

01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:17,887
Game yourself so now we're three-for-three on Larry becraft I'm not entirely

243 people who actually do like

1288
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,311
I meant

1289
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,383
Howard Lee head wrap

1290
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
Bob Shelton

1291
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
Surprise

1292
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,231
Perhaps only because

1293
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
The perfect example of how these

1294
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:49,375
Deep down even though even more than they're driven by Prince

1295
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:53,215
Bombshells started and ran the weed the people Foundation

1296
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,751
For constitutional education

1297
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,311
He was the president

1298
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:03,711
Vice president 53 much every other important role in hives

01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,015
This house like all reputable tax protest

01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
Because he groups who have been given

Status

1302
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:12,927
He's been exempt status

1303
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:19,327
Over the years Bob used by we the people to put out his anti-tax using

1304
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,119
A lot of people down the wrong path

1305
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
Making a lot of money out there

1306
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,471
Eventually once Obama was in office

1307
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,287
Cuz we the people do different being solely text-based group

1308
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,127
Conspiracy theories about how Obama wasn't a citizen

1309
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,711
Short fuse wtp money to buy

1310

On December 1st and 3rd 2018

1312
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,439
And is that

1313
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,719
Wood cabin

1314
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,999
Thought you know

01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,815
He would have been fine really speaker

1316
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,655
Keep your head down

1317
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,959
Just keep your head down and don't attract attention

1318
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
Into yourself

1319
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,775
Stop would not have gotten in trouble for any of

1320
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,847
He would be happy as a clam make a nonsense accusation

1321
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,383
If you just paid

01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,407
It taxes

1323
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,943
His personal taxes

1324
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:12,575
Oh no we the people was the perfect place for him to hide his money

1325
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,135
Court documents reveal that he had made personal

1326
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,415
Unsecured loans to WT

1327
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,463
BP of over $100,000

1328
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,047
Do you practice the entire organization operated

1329
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,351
It short the court found that Bob Schultz

Abusive tax shelter

On July 12th 2018 for tax evasion

WTF

1334

The front

1335
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,175
I was rejected

1336
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,735
In all likelihood end up being in prison

1337
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,039
Before too long

1338
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
Your mother

1339
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
You just put it in some sort of offshore Bank

1340
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,255
Tickets

1341
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,047
More fun when you have a

1342
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:59,935
Organization your ass in front of the

1343
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:04,287
Create the tax-exempt business

1344
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,639
And then put all of my money in there and that's kind of like a big middle finger to the government

1345
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,431
Seat lookup

1346
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:16,831
Smarted your Sixteenth Amendment or whatever or amendments are going to have

1347
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,647
We should have stopped at 9

1348
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:25,279
That they're big on the temp on earlier

1349
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,887
So now we come to read back managing before the 13th for these

1350
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:33,471
I think that should be the rallying cry for these white instead of blood

1351
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,751
Soil and all that stuff

1352
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,055
Just be like the amendment before the 13th

1353
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Identify doodoo

1354
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
So

1355
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,831
Martin V the headliner of Murderers Row

1356
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
Martin

1357
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
Redback

1358
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,415
Instagram

1359
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
Text

1360
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,023
He's nineteen eighty-five book the law that never was

1361
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,559
The fraud of the 16th Amendment

1362
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,607
Is one of the primary drivers behind

1363
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
And the tax protest movement

1364
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,727
Despite the fact the claims made in the book it been repeatedly.

1365
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
Fraudulent by Court

1366
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
Novitex protest removal

1367
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,847
Existed since before the law.

1368
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,407
Never was this book led to Renaissance of idiots

1369
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
They know something about

1370
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:17,503
Beckman and his co-author William bent

1371
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,039
Represent the argument there book

1372
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
16th Amendment

1373
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
It was never ratified

1374
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,135
And therefore people don't have to pay tax

1375
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,695
The courts of review

1376
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:33,119
To be so baseless illegally classified the argument as frivolous

1377
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,167
YouTube YouTube

1378
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,775
You can hit with a penalty for just trying to make this argument in court

1379
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:45,407
That's like what's your f****** friends like she's legally a fascist

1380
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:49,759
This is legally frivolous

1381
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:53,599
What do you mean you can't just argue that a lot of amendments

1382
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,439
Was it actually ratified what's that well

1383
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
Benson's

1384
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
Clamdy did a bunch of research

1385
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,511
Sound like

1386
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,839
The versions that were ratified had punctuation

1387
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
Places

1388
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,751
Katana claims about like

1389
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:18,687
Has looked into all of the claims

1390
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
No that's good

1391
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,903
Originally when his argument started to be used

1392
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,463
The same people who got arrested for not paying their taxes

1393
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
They did review that evidence

1394
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
Found it

1395
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
To be lacking

1396
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,839
So naturally William Benson was arrested

1397
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:41,471
For not paying your taxes on over 104 years in prison

1398
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,287
He tried to appeal in the process insisted that he should

1399
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079
Allowed to have a hearing on whether or not to

1400
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,359
Sixteenth Amendment ratified

1401
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
Icracked

1402
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223
In their decision

1403
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,247
Benson is wrong

1404
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,575
Thomas which is a previous court case about this

1405
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,671
We specifically exam of the arguments made in the law that never was

1406
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,951
Concluded that Benson

1407
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,023
Did not discover anything

1408
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:10,399
Your honor I would like to challenge the 16th Amendment on the basis of

1409
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:14,239
Existence and everyone had to transcribe it themselves

1410
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:19,359
In 2007 the United States district court for the northern district of Illinois

1411
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
In his six

1412
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,175
16th Amendment

1413
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,711
Reliance program

1414
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,015
16th Amendment

1415
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,575
Selling in order to

1416
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:34,975
This is how you get out of paying

1417
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:42,655
They found that selling the 16th Amendment for Life program constituted commercial fraud

1418
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,703
He was profiting off giving people

1419
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,727
Specifically fraudulent

1420
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
Advice

1421
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,335
Because that was covered by the First Amendment

1422
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,895
But that he had to stop selling packages

1423
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,175
Some of which cost up to

1424
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
35

1425
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,991
$100

1426
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,343
All red

1427
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,743
Play William Benson

1428
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,791
Where's all been about William

1429
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,327
It's been about Benson

1430
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,375
Because he's easier one of these two to get in

1431
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,167
William Benson is a fan

1432
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
Protesting idiot

1433
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,239
Red Beckman

1434
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Is a monster

1435
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,055
Human disguise

1436
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:27,967
So we have our Rodger stone versus our Alex Jones

1437
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,391
Call the church.

1438
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,975
It was judgement not Holocaust

1439
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:45,119
The Troon almighty God use the people Nazi government religion

1440
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,935
Of those with crucified the bride

1441
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:52,031
Bad they talked about the terrible Holocaust of Hitler's Nazi Germany

1442
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,615
They are still with us today still worshiping their God Satan

1443
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
And they're still stealing from the people

1444
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,759
Rural fire to create a Federal Reserve banking system

1445
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
Huh

1446
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,367
Huh

1447
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:10,975
Call to the Federal reserve's

1448
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
There is is evil because the thing that the Jews conspire to create it but it's like

1449
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:22,751
Implies in his unwilling to correct

1450
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,311
The Jews created the Federal

1451
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,871
I think that a lot of people

1452
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,199
Side on Alex's side of things

1453
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:31,967
Do you think

1454
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,551
Gmail

1455
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:41,951
It's the same thing as a s*** you know what look you want to say bulshit like

1456
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,279
The Jews killed our Saviour whatever at least there's some kind of like

1457
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Words

1458
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
Not just like

1459
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,863
Do you know what

1460
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,167
The Jews killed all the Unicorn

1461
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
That is true

1462
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:13,183
I don't know why why do we stop yelling at me

1463
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
Stop it

1464
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:18,303
Also

1465
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,351
He has a long history which is

1466
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
Phraseology

1467
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
Apology

1468
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,447
There's a long history of speaking at whites

1469
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,471
Supremacist Gathering

1470
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
Alex

1471
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,775
Should know that

1472
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,591
Is every reason to know that in 2009

1473
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,407
When he's talking about having him on as a legitimate

1474
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,247
294 red suit a whole bunch of people

1475
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,783
Including Alan Greenspan

1476
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:43,647
In the US District Court of Montana because back in 1970s

1477
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,671
In 1970

1478
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:48,255
7 because he didn't pay his taxes there was a lien placed on it

1479
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,327
He just decided f*** it I'm still going to stay here

1480
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,631
Even though they're trying to take away

1481
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:57,983
Got everything they're Tangled Up in Westerly

1482
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:09,247
Tying up the courts with frivolous suits to dry in a phone

1483
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
Come to a head

1484
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,695
People seem to have a little bit of

1485
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
Go great

1486
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,095
Read document largely boiled down to Sovereign citizen lines about him not being a person

1487
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,631
Like that freeman-on-the-land

1488
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:29,471
And kind of stuff I'm allergic to bees and therefore I am exempt

1489
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,239
From taxes

1490
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,799
He ended up being evicted from his land

1491
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,847
Pita Pit

1492
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
When he was not going to

1493
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
Supremacist

1494
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,503
Not good no more Waco

1495
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,807
When asked about piggies

1496
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:50,207
When asked about things you told them this eviction isn't going to go the way they law enforcement playing

1497
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,791
There's going to be enough guns to make sure of that

1498
01:17:55,583 --> 01:18:01,727
The law enforcement plant

1499
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:08,127
Kicked off then doubt a burn down

1500
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:24,767
Okay I'm not going to I'm not going to know

1501
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:30,655
Long after long after he gets vacated the premises

1502
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,983
Pictures that you put those in the same setting

1503
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,055
Together I understand what kind of confusing

1504
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,895
Exactly plan Weber.

1505
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,967
Loud later

1506
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,247
Later

1507
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,623
The dude Bob Schultz Tom Cryer red Beckman

1508
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,767
Do Alex says are legitimate tax researchers

1509
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
I think we've shown

1510
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,071
They are not

1511
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,399
Yeah

1512
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:08,031
Who has failed over and over again to make argument

1513
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,079
Courts that they shouldn't have to pay taxes

1514
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:13,151
Is largely gotten in big trouble because of it

1515
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,527
You can't preach the things you're preaching because it illegally fraud

1516
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:23,903
So

1517
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,231
Okay

1518
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
Come on

1519
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
Hannibal

1520
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,559
Backpack

1521
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
Oh okay alright

1522
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
Piecraft

1523
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:42,847
He's the only one who successfully do you know that you're right

1524
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,383
My brother

1525
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
We don't need to worry about that

1526
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,855
Like I said bring them to the end of March

1527
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
First of all if you robbed

1528
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:03,839
Like people who are less reputable than these five

1529
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:10,239
We refused at a barbershop

1530
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,263
Goodwin the beat

1531
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,311
You can never goofy or troop than these after

1532
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
They're all crazy

1533
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
Very wrong

1534
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,736
Search and they are a ragtag band of Heroes

1535
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,552
Infiltrate

1536
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
Turn up

1537
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,512
Don't like I said we're going on a little bit of

1538
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,048
The 4th gear just because

1539
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:39,168
I didn't want to end on that like laundry list of tax protesters

1540
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
The 4th

1541
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,544
Alex is like he's mad at Glenn Beck

1542
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,944
Brewing Shore a little bit

1543
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,224
I'm starting to get

1544
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,296
Much more frustrated with Glenn Beck

1545
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
Doesn't really go anywhere

1546
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,392
You kind of mad about the idea that

1547
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,160
Glenn Beck

1548
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Talkin about

1549
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
FEMA camps

1550
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,512
I'm being like I do I got to research this I don't know if I can

1551
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:09,120
I was like that's my bread-and-butter grind

1552
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
I'm going to

1553
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,192
Half hour

1554
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
Finger finger

1555
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,544
Whenever I try and do that

1556
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,080
I just have too much of it

1557
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,992
You're all the time for people with all the evidence

1558
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,624
I'm so unlike

1559
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,512
Weird

1560
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
About abortion

1561
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,328
And talking about how like

1562
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,120
If you're sorry you can repent

1563
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,936
And all this stuff not mentioning his own history with abortion

1564
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
It's really weird

1565
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,080
Dimensions of stories doesn't

1566
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,872
From the Miami Herald about an abortion

1567
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:58,272
Doctor Who Threw baby up against the wall and then threw it in the garbage and ate it for a couple days while the baby was still alive

1568
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,344
None of that is in there

1569
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:05,440
It's the wall like the baby Odin money

1570
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,208
Yeah

1571
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,792
Start a Shakedown this penis

1572
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:13,376
Stories

1573
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
About is absolute

1574
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,080
They happened

1575
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
They were doing with malpractice

1576
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,408
And they do deserve

1577
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,064
Cast of all the rest

1578
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Eating a baby

1579
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,928
Who's alive in a trash can for days really don't think I could do that

1580
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,696
Possible

1581
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,744
And not in the article

1582
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,048
Can't find that anywhere except Alex's

1583
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
Weird brains

1584
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,608
But it's down

1585
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
Crazy

1586
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:47,936
He ends up

1587
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,984
Like he said he was going to get

1588
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,336
Get into the FEMA camps

1589
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
20 minutes

1590
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:01,760
Well the rest is greater than the guy who covers the rat eating babies

1591
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,856
Might be

1592
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,392
But it's

1593
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,696
Glory will come when we defeat

1594
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,256
Globalist that's when you have the Clipper he's talking about

1595
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,424
Didn't have time

1596
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,288
This is 20 minutes

1597
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:29,152
Alright

1598
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
I can't

1599
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,480
I can't

1600
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,504
They makes no sense

1601
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,344
If you want to prove it prove it

1602
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,136
Clearly is motivated by

1603
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,184
Papa Keno's

1604
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,792
He feels guilt about but doesn't want a process that guilt now so does this

1605
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,328
Rambling diatribe

1606
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120
About nothing

1607
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:53,216
Now it's like you know how when you studied really hard for

1608
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
And you know everything about that

1609
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
But

1610
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,824
You have a little bit of

1611
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,128
So the night before

1612
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,712
No you don't really sleep and then the next morning

1613
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,040
You can't stop thinking about drawing

1614
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
Incredible

1615
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,672
Metallica's most recent album

1616
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,512
That is the only thing that happens to everybody so sometimes

1617
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:21,120
You're going to prove that the government is destroying everybody's lives with FEMA

1618
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,288
Start talking about rats eating a fetus and then from there other than

1619
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,336
I'm the greatest there ever was

1620
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,384
Boba

1621
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,272
One Clip that I wanted to play from this episode of the part that I watch

1622
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
Because I think it's

1623
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,856
I think it's indicative of a couple of inter

1624
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
Trusting thing

1625
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,904
They were still tracking

1626
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
And Alex is at 3

1627
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,488
Like we be here all day

1628
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,256
If we were

1629
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,584
7:40

1630
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:02,336
Metaphorically

1631
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,360
Go down that route

1632
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,384
I would probably

1633
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,992
It was just

1634
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,808
Whoopi Sher

1635
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
So you

1636
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,696
In terms of us following

1637
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,720
A coherent

1638
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
32000

1639
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:58,400
Because I'm controlled it's conspiracy theory

1640
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:08,384
Next

1641
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:16,832
Russia

1642
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,904
Flash

1643
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,840
It's just incredible propaganda

1644
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
But Alex

1645
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,240
Describing the sort of Russo Georgia

1646
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,104
Is very clearly indicative that I just

1647
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
He is

1648
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,688
Hook Line & Sinker believe in the Russian lion

1649
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:45,760
Because what happened

1650
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,320
It's not at all the way you've described they were separate

1651
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:53,184
Ndi application region in South Australia

1652
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,744
They started attacking ethnic Georgian villages

1653
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,048
It started ethnically cleansing Georgians

1654
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,584
Out of those areas

1655
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
Georgia

1656
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,424
Sovereign territory

1657
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,728
Was George

1658
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,008
Started fighting back

1659
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:07,776
Against those.

1660
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,800
Separatist

1661
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,592
Who believe themselves to be

1662
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:14,432
Closer live with Russia Russia started

1663
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,272
Eventually

1664
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:26,976
The conflict Georgia was more complicated than

1665
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,512
Giving a service

1666
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
It's not

1667
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,960
Is very clear indications that the Southpaw sessions

1668
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,032
Were actually

1669
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,312
On in Russian

1670
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
In order to Annex

1671
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,128
Parts of Georgia

1672
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,664
To the Soviet Union

1673
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,944
When was the last

1674
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,016
Russia was the

1675
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,088
Goodguys in any kind of action towards

1676
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,904
Consolidating the old Soviet Union back

1677
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,720
And also they have occupied

1678
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,680
Seems like another insta

1679
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
Russian incursion

1680
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,008
Galaxy

1681
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,592
You know taking the Russian line on

1682
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,872
Which onion is fine

1683
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,432
Be more upfront about what

1684
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,456
Truth

1685
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,760
We want to believe the truth is

1686
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Who's going to save us

1687
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
From the New World Order

1688
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:31,232
Jesus believed that since 2000

1689
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,512
Something worthwhile

1690
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
To bring into our

1691
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
Fear

1692
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,584
This investigation

1693
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,120
Because

1694
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,680
It's not a part of whatever change

1695
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:40,960
You don't say

1696
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,264
Like all the other stuff is still different

1697
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,848
Yeah military stuff the pro net neutrality

1698
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,896
The anti-israel pro

1699
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,176
Business

1700
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,272
That's very different than where he will end up being

1701
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,832
But the brushes stuff is always been

1702
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:01,440
It's always been there

1703
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
Is that what it really is

1704
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:08,864
I mean in 2015 when he was talking all that stuff about I like Putin May save the world

1705
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,192
When you talk about that talks about it being like a masculine

1706
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:12,960
In state

1707
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,264
What is like a testosterone to

1708
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:20,128
Murdered

1709
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,920
Close to a Christian

1710
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:24,480
I think he believes that which is crazy

1711
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,112
Any like if he looks into Russian Orthodox Church

1712
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,904
It would be like oh no nevermind

1713
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
I think he believes those store

1714
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,000
Things on a baseline level

1715
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,560
Russian media

1716
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,840
Being very

1717
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,936
Accommodating to his anti-west

1718
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
There's different

1719
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
There's different reasons

1720
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:49,824
I know that Alex

1721
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,688
Alex is anti New World Order

1722
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
Yeah

1723
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,224
And

1724
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,272
Putin and his Circle

1725
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,552
Or anti

1726
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,832
Atlantis ism

1727
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,904
The western western Europe

1728
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,720
The United States any kind of

1729
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,512
Allow

1730
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,536
Them two

1731
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,328
Encroach on their neighbors and what have you

1732
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,400
Alex peas

1733
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,192
Russia

1734
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,984
To have him on

1735
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
As an expert

1736
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
And sing

1737
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,080
He sees Russian M staying very similar

1738
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:26,432
He doesn't understand that the reason for that is very interested

1739
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,992
By weakening

1740
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,016
The alliance

1741
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,064
States in Europe

1742
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,160
He thinks like I know about the globalist they're on the same team

1743
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,744
Flattery I just I just have a heart

1744
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,560
I think it's partially flattery partially like

1745
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
Twisted familiarity

1746
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:50,752
Perhaps but he sees a lot of his worldview mirrored not realizing the reason that it's mirror

1747
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,032
Is because both

1748
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,056
Destructive to

1749
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,336
Status quo

1750
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,384
Maybe

1751
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:02,784
Fruit for the amount of water

1752
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,552
That just doesn't

1753
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:06,368
Enough you know what I don't know if he's doing that much

1754
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,416
Carrying now I think it might be the sort of thing

1755
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
Grows over time

1756
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:10,976
Goodbye

1757
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,256
I think that's probably

1758
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
Probably the

1759
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,840
I don't know it's weird

1760
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:18,400
Navarre

1761
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:23,008
A little a little

1762
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:23,776
It's kind of like

1763
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,848
Satisfying in terms of like what we're looking for

1764
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,688
But it is what it is I like the idea that we got to learn about these weirdo

1765
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,112
American speed like these trends

1766
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,440
Bloons TD Transit

1767
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,488
I've already been established

1768
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
Early 2000

1769
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,072
Racino pivot we

1770
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,864
Alex not be interested at all

1771
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:55,264
Almost a week now after the Tea Party

1772
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,360
Disapproval of Glenda

1773
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,408
Yeah I think is Glenn Beck star starts

1774
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,432
And of course

1775
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,200
Michael weiner

1776
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,480
Michael weiner

1777
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,904
Michael wieners.

1778
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,768
She's one of the first people I was saying these things what do you do

1779
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,792
He's a wiener

1780
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:23,168
What we see what happens in the near future

1781
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,192
For now

1782
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,728
I'm not super interested in

1783
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Alex's

1784
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
Present

1785
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,544
Situation

1786
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,360
Twitter and I've kicked off

1787
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,384
Apple

1788
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
ITunes app

1789
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,944
Yep kicked-off yep

1790
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,480
I mean we're just going to see

1791
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
Google see what happens

1792
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,552
It's not all that

1793
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,136
Too much into the world

1794
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,160
Go to schottenfreude

1795
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,464
His painting

1796
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,768
I know it's easy to feel that it's fun

1797
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,328
Productive

1798
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:55,168
I think I think it's going to let him wash down the drain and then

1799
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,448
Become whatever you become

1800
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,984
And in the meantime I think

1801
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,032
Interesting to see what

1802
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,848
Let him slide down the banister

1803
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:10,784
Check out our website knowledge fight.com

1804
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:15,648
Knowledge underscore forever

1805
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:23,072
Can talk about Alex Jones

1806
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
Cause

1807
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,656
Very serious harm

1808
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,960
Two people and privacy

1809
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,496
Slander Folk

1810
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:34,336
Which we try not to do and if you would like to hear us not do that

1811
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:39,456
The sporting a show really appreciate it

1812
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Have I got

1813
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,272
Word or the

1814
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,832
One of the problems might be the we don't have

1815
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
Goals

1816
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,392
Up on the patreon

1817
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:59,168
We had two goals up and the two of them were roles that we just went ahead and fulfilled before

1818
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:03,264
Or even hit the one with the live show of now

1819
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,360
The other was breakdown one of the documentary

1820
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:10,176
Right and I realize like I didn't know what to

1821
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,456
To do with any other goals

1822
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
But it

1823
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:17,088
Inspired by it or whatever

1824
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,624
That's why I've stuck to new goals

1825
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,672
Yeah on the on the patreon

1826
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,000
Which were working towards one of them will do another

1827
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,536
Okay

1828
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,840
Probably not The Obama Deception

1829
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:32,704
I'm not sure we'll figure it out but we'll do another documentary if we reach that other goal

1830
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
I'm calling my magnum opus

1831
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,384
People have asked me to put out a book

1832
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,408
A book

1833
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
Don't want

1834
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,040
So I've come up with another form

1835
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,856
To put out the information I would put in a book

1836
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,392
I'll start releasing it

1837
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,416
If we hit that goal

1838
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,584
Probably serve releasing it at some point anyway but if we get it I will feel guilty if we haven't started

1839
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,400
I'll put it that way

1840
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,728
Alright appreciate it

1841
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,288
If you have if you don't and you want to help us work towards

1842
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,896
Anyway

1843
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:13,920
Has been fun

1844
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
But

1845
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:20,576
What did Alex Jones

1846
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
That is

1847
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
You probably killed a dude

1848
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,584
Alexandra Thurston color
