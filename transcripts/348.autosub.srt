1
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Respectful

2
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
Knowledge

4
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
Need money

5
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:59,136
Cam

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
About Alex

7
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:12,192
Exhausting time going on

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
Real quick

9
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
Sure

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
Question

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,432
I might have time for both of us

12
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Picture of

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
Or receiver of

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
A surprise

15
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
Nope next

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,280
I've been involved in one

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Hey there is no memory

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,704
Where I am

19
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,056
I know that I've yelled surprise at somebody

20
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Idaho

21
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,552
I am sure that I've been at a party where we all surprised but

22
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
To the extent that I remember any specific way it means I might have been like a third to your friend that was

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Therefore a surprise birthday

24
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,608
I don't know that I think I'm pretty lucky in that I don't think anyone has ever thought like

25
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
I think I would actually probably definitely

26
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
I would enjoy is not the same as thank you for syrup

27
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
I will try not to be grumpy

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Unfit

29
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
No idea

30
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
Assume I have

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
I was just checking

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
Clarifying

33
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,144
Notable

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Surprise party

35
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:53,824
I do know a lot about Alex Jones

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
Today in the world

37
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
The hills are alive with the sound of b*******

38
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
Going on in the world

39
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
Put out our last episode

40
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,400
But we've done it before a lot of the news that's irrelevant people probably interest

41
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
Analysis

42
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,288
Gone the present

43
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
September 24th

44
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Open 25th

45
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
Which would be worth that Tuesday and Wednesday

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
Have this week Ryan

47
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
There's alot going on

48
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,024
So we've got first of all for everyone who doesn't know the sort of the

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
The broad Strokes of what

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Been going on we have the

51
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,912
Trump Ukraine situation

52
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
Posterity

53
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,056
We have the news breaking of the impeachment inquiry in the house

54
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
We have Trump going to the UN and saying that the futures for Global are not for Global Entry.

55
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,064
He said Patriots I can't even listen to him speak for

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Speech

57
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Beyond Justice contact

58
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
It's delivery was like a dude who got hit with a quaalude Dart like it was very lethargic

59
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Every time somebody describes

60
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Maybe I should listen

61
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
It was upsetting

62
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Alex playing Alonzo

63
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
Of course you got all that stuff and then the big breaking news on Wednesday was the Alex Jones has launched his web

64
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
That he's been talking about forever

65
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
5 blocks

66
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
Space

67
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,119
As we go through

68
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
There'll be minimal bar

69
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
And make this podcast.

70
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759
So first of all

Sign

86
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Oh no

87
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,135
Plau gauldin

88
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
You know it's not fair

89
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
It's not fair I don't want to be

90
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,887
This guy who can't pronounce your name

91
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Will putting two I'll take the blame

92
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,359
About the appreciation thank you so much allow fine

93
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
You're now along with mosque

94
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Wonderful

95
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
Heroin

96
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
So good

97
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
Freakishly large

98
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
First one absolute

99
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Correctamente

100
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
Looks like it's math can fix

101
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
Patreon

102
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
So

103
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Is an out-of-context drop

104
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
From Today Show

105
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Stupid

106
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
Why can't you turn on the country

107
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,039
That's rough

108
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
That's bad news for Americans

109
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
When they lose the king of Americana the king of loving this country

110
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,399
You people are soft

111
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495
As we get into this

112
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,871
The beginning of the show is the first 20 minutes of it is just a pretty uninspired attack on Greta thunberg

113
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,687
Who is 16 years old

114
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,295
Alex spent the first chunk of the show comparing her to Hitler and talking about the Hitler

115
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
I had to be sure Greta's age doesn't make her above criticism but it's her off-limits to this style of Target

116
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
Even if you thoroughly detest the message that you

117
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Keep putting out

118
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,399
Like I missed out on some prime Duncan opportunities in the course of doing this podcast

119
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
As it relates to self

120
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
The racist fourteen-year-old or Alex's done wreck

121
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
But it's just not right

122
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,407
To treat you just like that even if you disagree vehemently about their position

123
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
Or at least that's my position that I think that

124
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
A pretty decent way to operate

125
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,623
I mean especially if you imagine yourself back when you were

126
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,231
Some of the things that you were you said you probably saying

127
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,047
F****** Hitler Youth for crazy

128
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
We've even talked very little about the Covington kids

129
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Almond podcast accepting the contact

130
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
Barnes lawyer

131
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,591
Yeah like they might be assholes or whatever but it's not

132
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
Leave that for other people

133
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
And I don't think this because I don't think Greta

134
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
At her age

135
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
And being a part of this younger online generation

136
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,839
I'm sure thing is her skin is thick enough to not care too much about what a loser like Alex Jones

137
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,935
It's more the disordered Behavior as the exclusive action of someone who is it by

138
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,263
It's a sort of thing that Alex would be deeply ashamed

139
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
To do where he capable of that emotion

140
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
And think it's even sadder is that he's just

141
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
Repeating other people's ideas

142
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
When are Wednesday episode came out where we went over September 23rd

143
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,391
Responses from listeners wondering why we didn't cover Alex talking about Greta

144
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
If he was complaining about the all that climate change

145
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
GameStop through a good part of that Epic

146
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,607
And I probably should have made this more clear he didn't really talk about her at all on the 23rd

147
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,215
It wasn't until Tucker Carlson did a segment about her on the evening of the 23rd

148
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
That you even really entered Alex's head as a Target

149
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Who's talking points

150
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Escalating them

151
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
And repackaging them for Annex

152
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Estadio

153
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
That's really all that's going on here at the beginning

154
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
It's crazy I was looking at the episode

155
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,879
Why we're almost a half-hour into this thing and there is nothing happening

156
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Except that

157
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
I watched

158
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Heroin

159
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Man

160
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
That Alex does misrepresent belongs in a movie of the one that we're living in

161
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Where we die very shortly

162
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
Generation is playing

163
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Generation

164
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
They have reason to know what they're doing and still failing

165
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
Alex interpreted that as a big brother

166
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
Call Ray Charles

167
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
Call Dowd

168
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:26,591
Because people applauded at that and I was just looking at all of them

169
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,407
The all of the people applauding

170
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,247
Those are the ones she's watching

171
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
Actively f****** destroying the planet

172
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,671
Don Alex

173
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
Is that her Target

174
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Who she was

175
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Speaking most

176
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Condemning lie about wasn't

177
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,679
People like Alex or even these climate deniers necessarily

178
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
But the people who will love

179
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Conviction to do so

180
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
Entire conference

181
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Pelosi

182
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Sure

183
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:07,551
This was a big chunk of the episode cuz we're going to get into

184
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Stop

185
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
It feels kind of in media res

186
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,743
A ways into the episode because it is

187
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
I just don't have any

188
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
We're listening to him

189
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Y'all about how a sixteen-year-old kid is hit

190
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,471
Pathetic we are still going to talk a little bit about some of those,

191
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Yahoo

192
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
That's.

193
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Why

194
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
Alex has

195
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
Here's what I want

196
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Popping in

197
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Great

198
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
To talk about

199
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
The death of

200
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
The Donald

201
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
Pro Trump

202
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Or domain

203
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
So he's going to have carpet

204
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,127
Right right right to give a good moratorium on the Donald

205
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,199
Really standard stuff

206
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,575
And we'll get into a little bit of it but even without listening I knew what this was going to be about

207
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,159
I'm going to talk about the

208
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22,303
I copied octopus started his memeworld site and he's trying to lay claim to the legacy of the Donald subreddit

209
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
He's hoping that he can direct traffic from the people who are there

210
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,215
Is there were millions of visitors do the Donald

211
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,799
There are not millions of visitors

212
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
101

213
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Exercise

214
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
Parsley because his website suck

215
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
Partially because what made the Donald work

216
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
Aw to do with the infrastructure of Reddit

217
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
How old is desiigner

218
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,791
Memeworld has a vastly inferior structure

219
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Google casually browsing the site

220
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
Who are the targets of the memes that would come out of the Donald

221
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,239
Without the underwear audience of millions upon whom you can subject

222
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Your b******* lose

223
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,871
And I suspect is going to learn that lesson

224
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
The hard way

225
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Cuz he is really pitching in with

226
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Disney World built

227
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Vague

228
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
H.h.

229
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
It's like watching two dinosaurs try and drive

230
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
That's like

231
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Do not belong

232
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Wrong

233
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
You know globalist

234
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,423
Stuffed starts ranting about demons

235
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
There's no better way

236
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Just ranted about bulshit

237
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Program

238
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199

239
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
The program

240
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Forbes India

241
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Free will destroy

242
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
And

243
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911

Check on their form.

251
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
Nothing more than slaves let's look at Greta

252
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
The Grinch

253
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
What

254
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
A fossil fuels pictures

255
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,735
They're real or not for parrots a

256
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Hey guess what

257
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,303
Vaccination records is my next

258
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
He's clever

259
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
Videos how to make a sentence

260
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:45,823
Girls baby

261
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
And it's just

262
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
It's Pat

263
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
She's attacking her

264
00:16:54,271 --> 00:17:00,415
Your mind's been destroyed

265
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
Even great to do an adult

266
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Do you know who insulted

267
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
16 year old

268
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Cool guy

269
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Sixteen-year-old oh yeah

270
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Do you know who shouldn't

271
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,471
Adult year old

272
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,823
Brilliant genius types like Alex Jones yesterday

273
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,663
That she's trying to get rid of the fossil fuel

274
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,247
She's trying to rule by destroying fossil fuels

275
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,087
If she can successfully destroy fossil fuels

276
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
She could forget you have shown yourself

277
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:35,743
To be a fossil fuel

278
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
You have put yourself in League with

279
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,679
Literally I well yeah I do that so you may not know that but I got you

280
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Weird things that

281
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
It's almost like it's a god

282
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,199
Earth starts losing its atmosphere

283
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
A trace cash

284
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
1%

285
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Suddenly we find

286
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Giant supplies of Hellboy

287
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
In the Earth

288
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Poquito

289
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Zoom in

290
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
Sure

291
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Yeah

292
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
So I find this really weird because here we see Alex telling his audience with the real issue with climate change

293
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
Change is a parademon CO2 to the air because the Earth is CO2 deficient God placed

294
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,399
Fuel reserves into the ground so humid

295
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
Find them adjust the time

296
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,407
Attar's

297
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,551
For me because you know the ravings of a lunatic

298
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
But it's also weird because I thought it was

299
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
Rich Al Gore and George Soros destroying the last

300
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,375
Now it's a plot by demons to stop

301
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Story straight

302
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Metastasize

303
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,455
CO2 levels are at their lowest ever

304
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
Complete bulshit

305
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Thousand Years

306
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,207
Which is a lot longer than Homo sapiens been around

307
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Some 10,000 years ago

308
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
What's the present day

309
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
Highest atmospheric CO2 level

310
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
Where it levels unseat in recorded history

311
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,103
In order to know when the last time

312
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
It's

313
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,527
Uncharted waters

314
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
Sick. Was marked by Massive

315
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
CO2 explosion

316
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
That's why the plants

317
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Priscilla large

318
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,583
Are some theories

319
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,191
Port

320
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Can't argue with that

321
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
What do you not want sports to do well

322
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Sports

323
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,735
Completely opposite of credible Source I can find

324
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
He's not living in reality

325
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:43,903
Just promoting real battle of Armageddon

326
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
And you really got to ask yourself why would someone do that

327
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
So I should tell you this

328
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,119
I got you about an hour into the show and it dawned on me that

329
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Hadn't even read

330
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Prince Donald Trump

331
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Where you know you said that

332
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
Future doesn't belong

333
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
Which is basically him doing Alex's show

334
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
In front of you

335
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,551
These Trump gave his remarks at approximately 9:15 a.m. Austin time so it was legitimately No Way Out

336
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
Should be unaware of that speech by the time he goes on air at 11

337
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
You seem really strange to me that he's waste

338
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,744
Thing is. I'm rambling about Greta thunberg and

339
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,376
Talking about that guy we're going to have Carpe donktum on to talk about the Donald

340
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
Doing nothing related to

341
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Everyone else is concerned about

342
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
It's very strange to me

343
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Videos I want to cover

344
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:43,296
It should be like we are

345
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,648
Tyvm the secretary-general

346
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Because if he

347
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Play the

348
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
The clip of it everybody go

349
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Where you haven't listened to

350
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,840
And Alex does play the clipse

351
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
So weird

352
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Country this is

353
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Business

354
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
I hate globalist

355
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
I love Patron

356
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
Here's the president saying exactly that

357
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
He's going into the den of vipers and he's like

358
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,512
Statesman coming up there you can make all sorts of this is the easiest

359
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
Kingspan printed today

360
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,144
It's so weird cuz there's no indication until

361
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
The show

362
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,264
But even really has heard it knows anything about it

363
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
It's very strange

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Instead

365
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
He spends time

366
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Complaining about climate change

367
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
And tell him almost certainly fake story about his birthday

368
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
I have that

369
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Parents

370
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
Lisa daughters the song Summer

371
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
The great Stan

372
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,360
My daughter comes home and cries when she drives by Tuesday

373
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
Just want to die

374
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
And so I kind of hear what you're saying is right now

375
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,928
A true story

376
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,792
That's a true story true story if it was

377
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,888
Explain by going to last episode you talking about like middle schoolers

378
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:42,080
What do you have to back that up an apocryphal story about a mother at a pool party

379
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Didn't happen

380
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,712
Middle School

381
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
That's a problem

382
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
That is a

383
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
No problem I think there is some holes in the story

384
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
Libero volleyball

385
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,144
Even if your kid was best friends with Alex Jones

386
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
You're not

387
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,240
Going there I mean you might just because it's unsafe

388
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,080
You might assume it's unsafe otherwise

389
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
I don't even know what this conversation

390
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,272
I don't even want to try and decode with a reality the Salvation might be what kind of polite conversation Alex's

391
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,088
Whatever

392
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
Ceramic Appliance more about Greta thunberg and this is great

393
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
Production Value Inn

394
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
On full display

395
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,888
So let's go ahead and roll video.

396
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
You're just a brief Exchange

397
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Come walking in the UN

398
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Are you up

399
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
Look at that

400
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
Amazing

401
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
That wasn't

402
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
Oh no

403
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:16,288
Oh no he can hear it but we can't know video

404
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
They are about doing the radio show

405
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Cheese's

406
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
Yeah there's a reason I don't think we've ever played like

407
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,320
A video

408
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,696
And I know Alex like I bought all these

409
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Butts

410
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
You should you should think about the format

411
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,912
What you doing

412
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
It alright

413
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:49,056
Play wonderful

414
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,616
Keaton short right now everybody's

415
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:57,760
You know there's conversation even on the 24th that's going around about

416
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Peachment

417
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
Trump

418
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,880
Starting to throw this around people having the conversation

419
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
Should be like we got to do it

420
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Butter in Adel

421
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Strongly

422
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Curtail

423
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
The subjective actually

424
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Doesn't have

425
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
To deal with any of the

426
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
The Mercury issue

427
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
The desert their conversation

428
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
I would say

429
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Moving so fast

430
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Coming up

431
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
So wild

432
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
I was on Morning Joe

433
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,144
He said that

434
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
6

435
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,800
To turn that into they're calling for the assassination of trump

436
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,872
Hey it's a Republican

437
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
Trump list

438
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,016
Anderson Primary

439
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
Start talking about the UN

440
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
But he still doesn't really bring up the

441
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
Globalist Patriot

442
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
Instead he has the

443
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Nope

444
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
What

445
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Abortion the Second Amendment

446
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
He's just done a lot

447
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
You got a lot

448
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536
Making does he actually believe the Trump is the fur

449
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,656
First u.s. president to use talk about religious persecution

450
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,472
He became president

451
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,872
Horrible set September 2016

452
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
From that speech

453
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,832
Progress is possible to preserve our identity

454
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Dominate another group

455
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,928
If our religion leads us to persecute those of another face

456
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
If we Taylor people who are gay

457
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
If our Traditions lead us to

458
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
To prevent girls from going

459
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
It's cool if we discriminate on the basis

460
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
Is the race or tribe or ethnicity

461
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,168
The Fragile bonds of civilization will spray

462
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
Right okay you mistook that for a

463
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Speech about

464
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Religious

465
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
You're mistaking

466
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Against religious

467
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,944
Said if I were allergic to persecute those of another

468
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
Right civilization Wilfred

469
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
For religious

470
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,416
Let me read a little more

471
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Religious

472
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,840
We will see. We see this mindset into many parts of the Middle East

473
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
There's so much of the collapse

474
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
In order

475
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:59,776
In order because L. Not because of policies or programs

476
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,616
But by resorting to persecuting political or religious

477
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
If you do literally any

478
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Like literally I

479
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
You'll find tons of

480
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,064
Into the pretty much every president the crying religious persecution one address

481
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
We went

482
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
Jordan

483
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
Alex isn't talking about the crying religious persecution especially not as a universal issue that needs to be done

484
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Play some trap for validating

485
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
His bulshit narrative

486
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,424
About his version of right-wing Christianity

487
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
That's what's going on

488
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,848
Respect religious freedom it's about celebrating having a president's Barber

489
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,480
The freedom of Christians then in all other religions or non-religious poke

490
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
Expensive all other life

491
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Not religious

492
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Can still feel like he's

493
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,488
Correct when he says no president has ever talked about religious oppression

494
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,328
All those other presidents were talking about all religions

495
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
Which isn't religious freedom to someone like Alex

496
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,496
Alex has a focusing on this aspect not really even highlighting the fact

497
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,824
Repeat that

498
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
Do you want which again

499
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
I don't

500
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Yeah it

501
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
It's like

502
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
It's like a

503
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
Alex

504
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Not since

505
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:20,160
Woodrow Wilson had somebody given such a speech on Racial equality

506
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:25,536
Yeah I think still is like operating off of like all right

507
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
Expected to do this show based on the talking points

508
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Tucker last night

509
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,192
Speech was a bit of a curveball in the morning

510
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,776
Let's see where it lands let me let me feel it out on air

511
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
Before I go too far with

512
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:44,736
Let me have my intern listen to it make sure he didn't say sike

513
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:51,648
I don't know what it is

514
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,976
Globalist

515
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Bendy's.

516
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
Future not going to belong to

517
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
Ralph your the globalist

518
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,704
So it focuses is very largely on

519
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Because again

520
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,360
What everyone needs to talk about

521
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Attack

522
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Attack

523
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,344
And we've come to a point where Alex is now following in the wake of people like Tucker as opposed to being the one who's more extreme

524
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
Now he has to wait

525
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,720
Follow their lead and make whatever they're saying more f***** up

526
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,280
And that's not even a really good game for him anymore.

527
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,888
Plenty of other website to do that

528
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
Industry

529
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:43,360
Scaramucci will record a video and send it to you for $100

530
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:49,248
So Alex complains a bunch bunch of little different

531
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Interesting

532
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
One piece that's sad

533
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
Better on a petty

534
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Okay

535
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
Popular in Europe

536
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:20,480
Emissions

537
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
And truck shows up

538
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
Literally

539
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:48,896
Lost the thread they're trying to be like

540
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:02,720
Alex

541
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
Just kind of making that up I don't remember her being rejected

542
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:16,288
Probably

543
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,480
Nothing in Her speech would lead a normal person to the conclusion

544
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,576
I like that question was

545
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Actively against climate change action

546
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,000
Who contributes to leaving the youth with a disastrous

547
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,608
Why do you scream all day everyday

548
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
Do the hoax whenever I know for sure

549
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Real world

550
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
It's because of Greta you please

551
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
I love you baby

552
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,432
Narrative

553
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Anywhere

554
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
Turn back around on him

555
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,904
Like he constantly screams about Democrats being literal demons trying to destroy the world now knowing should associate with them

556
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,000
So what if your fifteen-year-old Infowars listener whose parents are Democrats

557
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,840
Would that constitute Alex trying to break up your family

558
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
This is a stupid game to play

559
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
Yeah it is this

560
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Which is why he's

561
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:22,592
Alex is also doing everything in his power to associate Greta with George Soros

562
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
Which has been a big mission of a lot of the right-wing

563
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
We're grasping at straws

564
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Trying to attack her

565
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,576
Used Services is a picture of her posing with Soros

566
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,280
Was actually a picture of her with algor that someone to put cirrhosis head on outboard body

567
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,704
Alex's version is a little bit more about how Greta has a Soros link

568
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Handler

569
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,544
It was obviously a writing or speeches for in coaching

570
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,944
Greta who was along with the operation was handling

571
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
Okay I'm not sure what bulshit website he picked us up from But ultimately The Source goes back to a qanon Twitter account called

572
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
World Wide Awake

573
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
Q army Swiss division

574
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:15,072
Images of Greta with what appear to be the same woman

575
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Neubauer

576
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,424
Who allegedly works for a company called One Foundation

577
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Which has links to

578
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Soros Soros

579
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
Sure why not

580
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
Even if all these pictures are the same person

581
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,384
Neubauer does work for that Foundation

582
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,920
This is still super weak

583
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,968
As a connection and doesn't do anything

584
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,272
To prove that this is

585
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
The credibility of this source

586
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:43,488
Qanon Twitter account

587
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,792
Pizza things originally posted by Jordan

588
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,840
What are the big figures in the Cuba

589
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
Those guys are pretty

590
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Who's Jordans

591
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,544
He's a good big qanon guy on Twitter

592
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
Supple know that.

593
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Alright

594
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:03,200
The division of the coupon

595
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,088
Is crowded with qanon tweets and retweets of people like Paul Joseph

596
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,440
I did notice a whole lot of posts to be suspicious about Greta's hands

597
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
Somewhere about the size of her hair

598
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
I'm not sure why

599
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Conspiracy

600
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,608
Others were about how she went speed limiter

601
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,544
It's a very good morning and it reminds me a ton of the online

602
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
IPad after Sandy

603
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
About earlobes

604
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,688
Approved

605
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248
That was a really huge thing going around a message

606
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Woodworth people comparing earlobe

607
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,880
Wild wild time

608
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
They're putting into

609
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
Maybe if it's

610
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
A sign that they're wrong

611
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,608
Anyway from

612
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,448
Is the source for sites like big league politics to report the Greta thunberg has a

613
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Soros

614
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
Is not this thread is not

615
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,896
It starts by saying a quick look at Greta and her bisonic cabal ancestry

616
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
Alright tag

617
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
#qanon

618
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,808
Mysteriously that first tweet that starts the thread

619
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,112
Isn't cited by Big League politics

620
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,512
A random f****** weirdo qanon

621
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
Twitter account through all of this

622
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,312
Right-wing websites that I found that use this

623
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,712
Call about serious why do they not sew

624
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Flights

625
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
I don't know

626
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:48,416
Sources include like I don't know.

627
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,816
Turn on and also this is her Masonic cabal

628
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,120
Ancestry

629
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,520
Family being in the Illuminati because

630
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,848
List of names this guy found includes both like hop

631
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
Sunburn

632
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
Jacob

633
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,832
I guess if we have any listeners with those last name congrats you're now the Illuminati

634
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:23,488
A couple pictures of Greta where she has one of her eyes cover

635
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,328
Aspire Shadow and another one appears to be a coin

636
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Any online

637
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:35,008
Conspiracy World everyone is convinced that anyone who takes a picture with one of their eyes covered is signaling to other Illuminati members are there

638
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Part of the group

639
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
It's one of the older and stupider elements of

640
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
Conspiracy Message Board s*** and I'm honestly shocked

641
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Steve it's still around

642
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Everybody takes

643
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Seriously B

644
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,016
You know if there's no accounting for qanon

645
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
I'm fine

646
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
With that

647
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Conspiracy theory

648
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
For back in the Polaroid days

649
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Where is like

650
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
Pictures have more Intel

651
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
When there are

652
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
Now there's ten million

653
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
I couldn't I could pull up my phone and

654
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,192
10 million photo

655
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,616
Because people that have pictures with one eye covered in the Illuminati

656
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
And then like

657
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:17,248
Fashion photographers started doing that with people

658
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
It's sad.

659
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,880
If you

660
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
You got

661
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
Again much like the earlobe

662
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
You got to check in

663
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,024
Go talk somebody

664
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:34,144
Picture

665
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
I'm doing in one moment

666
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
I concur

667
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:43,360
I will tell you I multiple pictures of myself intentionally cover

668
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
This exactly

669
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,016
Like legitimately some of the least credible bulshit I've ever

670
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,368
Did anybody. Wedding problems and their operation

671
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,696
Looking your way Big League politics

672
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,280
But that's attacking the messenger

673
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,096
So what about this luisa-marie neubauer

674
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
What about her

675
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
She is Soros Handler

676
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
I don't know does she work for big

677
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Chew no

678
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
Gina twenty-three-year-old climates

679
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
Activist apparently has

680
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,640
Has been at protested events sometimes with Greta Thun

681
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
So f****** what

682
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,600
So is they're both involved in the same become friends

683
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:31,232
As we're working for the One Foundation I don't know solid sourcing on that outside of it

684
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
Keanu Reeves got like 5,000 retweets

685
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
Conservice

686
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
For all this right-wing reporting

687
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,888
People so much

688
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,472
I told Louisa's LinkedIn page has been updated

689
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
What's up

690
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,712
You can find Spencer for working at a group called y7 climate delegation freelancing for The Huffington Post

691
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,064
If you scroll down far enough you'll find the chief volunteers

692
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,368
With an organization called one.org

693
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
As a youth

694
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,280
But here's the cord is not a climate change organization

695
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,632
It's geared at eliminating extreme poverty particularly in sub-Saharan Africa

696
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,544
Nothing to do with being a climate rally let alone

697
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Completely unrelated

698
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Tyceno

699
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,248
The board of directors at one.org

700
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,344
Former Senator Kelly ayotte

701
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
Suspicious

702
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
George Soros

703
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
I know that and I can

704
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Yeah

705
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,376
Tax documents available for public review and Louisa's not a paid employee

706
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Confirm that

707
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,216
I've reviewed their financial documents and I see no evidence

708
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,776
Soros's heavy One Foundation

709
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Want action

710
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,967
It's donated

711
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
I would say that

712
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Sure I mean

713
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:04,415
I could see that controls organization is running Louisa as a Handler to get Greta to do his bit

714
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Why is it

715
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
So many

716
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
Become an accepted fact

717
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Within the

718
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
Conservative right-wing Circle

719
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
What assholes tweeting something

720
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:21,055
Well because there is look more real than what I

721
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Described here

722
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,871
This is a lot of the faces of it

723
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
Yeah I was able to find

724
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
One website

725
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
Call durable Reloaded

726
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,551
Better bit of Evan

727
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,647
Wait so we're talking about 1. Org and Europe Reloaded

728
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Is all a front for the Wachowski

729
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Wachowski

730
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,119
I don't know possibly but sat on that website

731
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,655
Two page on

732
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Gates Foundation

733
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
Website about 1

734
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:01,503
Posted said that Soros was one of the many people who provided funding to create an organization called

735
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Data

736
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
Poverty education

737
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,671
Within a few years this group combined with a number of other groups to eventually

738
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Create one

739
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,743
With the primary funding coming from the gates

740
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:16,607
There's no reason to assume from this or any other information that I can find

741
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,703
Cirrhosis any involvement other than being an initial funder of an organization

742
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,263
Part of another

743
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
There's no indication that he had anything to do with one

744
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
Outside of his involvement in data

745
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,199
Which literally could have just been him writing a check

746
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
One time

747
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,551
Though this is better proof than that qanon Twitter account

748
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
This is still

749
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
Completely failing

750
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
Approve thesaurus

751
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,415
To do with this organization

752
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,767
Nor disapprove that Louisa has been photographed with Greta because she's a Handler work

753
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Through one Foundation

754
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:51,679
All that is completely unfounded b******* nothing more than

755
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
A couple of out-of-context photos

756
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,543
An overriding desire to invalidate the words

757
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,847
16 year old girl is not being her own

758
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
It's an intense

759
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
Showing of weakness

760
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Save-A-Lot

761
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
It's very

762
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Still sticking

763
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
Nene's really pivot

764
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
Like I said

765
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
For the last couple years it's that like

766
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Like if it did been jacked

767
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
Pacific wouldn't have ever

768
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
Gotten a job anywhere after his

769
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,735
Mike cernovich wouldn't have a career

770
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
.

771
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
Wayback

772
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,671
Your Name Is Mud now use zelle

773
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,231
Register doesn't work that way

774
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Just doesn't

775
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,583
Yourself a man now people give you a job

776
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Cuz you're slippery

777
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,447
Dammit

778
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:00,543
Largely is that there is no evidence

779
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
To any of this

780
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,359
Being floated around

781
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
About Greta

782
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Soros

783
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,223
You look into where it come from

784
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,575
Nine times out of ten it's going to be that qanon Twitter account

785
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,135
And the other times it's going to just be

786
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
This is going to be Miss representation

787
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
Being

788
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,815
Made up of a bunch of organization

789
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,399
Data which Soros gave initial fund

790
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
Going to and that's fun

791
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
Thin

792
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
But even despite all that

793
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Do you

794
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
What's wrong

795
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
They know the greater the

796
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
Know what they disagree

797
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,551
Sweetly they love Greta the youth are really the Greta

798
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,367
No I mean like she's really cool

799
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,511
I'm 32 and she's really cool

800
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,095
Write about other

801
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423

Looks like The Walking Dead

804
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
These are they

805
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Pathetic followers

806
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,671
The cannon fodder the useful idiot the moron just munch

807
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Mark

808
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,191
People that bought the condo

809
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,751
Is there a mirror

810
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,919
Oh no

811
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
They get mad at you twice

812
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
My family

813
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,351
Winchester branch

814
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Isabella

815
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
That's a good deal

816
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:10,335
Do it

817
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
I knew it was coming

818
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
Business

819
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,735
They wouldn't talk to me I still got ripped off by

820
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,551
I thought I called the Nigerian

821
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,463
Why were you in business with this guy

822
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
Also Alex

823
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:34,399
Very clearly got tricked by both

824
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,423
Solutely

825
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,727
So

826
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:45,151
Add the chicken or the egg situation I don't know you probably got taken by the Nigerian scam and is trying to make it up

827
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:51,551
Parking garage speaker

828
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,367
I got it

829
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Yeah

830
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,255
Stop complaining about Greta for a bit and because

831
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
Good time to talk to the doc

832
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,911
He's going out to break here and he's talking about the Donald

833
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
Subway

834
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,007
He's going to have them come in after the break

835
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
I believe

836
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
And

837
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
This is

838
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
I would say that this

839
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
Is

840
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Something

841
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
A f*****-up person

842
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,111
Of the Donald subreddit

843
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,303
Don't put lipstick on them

844
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:42,239
And sometimes

845
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,039
I'd like to remind you this

846
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,367
What is the difference

847
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
Subreddit

848
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
Is a dead horse

849
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
No life

850
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
Right

851
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
People have

852
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Aha

853
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
Okay now

854
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
That is an

855
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,591
If it's not positive

856
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Right

857
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
I don't know

858
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Okay so then

859
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,807
If it's if that's what it is though

860
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
Then it's not hurting

861
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
Well there is that angle

862
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:40,607
It's very clearly I would legitimately feel an obligation to

863
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,631
When I come back from break

864
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:47,007
Explain what I meant

865
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
And is that

866
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:53,663
Sort of metaphor that you come up with when you're trying to describe

867
00:49:53,919 --> 00:50:00,063
Right right right

868
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,111
Corpse to have sex with its bill

869
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,975
What was that

870
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,511
Female Tom Petty Mary Jane

871
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Music video

872
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,351
I feel like there are other metaphors you can

873
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
You come up with

874
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,703
Describe a similar thing

875
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,287
Are keeping around your old cell phone even though it's dead

876
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:26,175
That I don't know

877
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,991
But it's not as f***** up

878
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
Anyway

879
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,575
Alex that comes back

880
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
For break

881
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
The dog

882
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
With the dog

883
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
This is

884
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
Crazy they are just talking about

885
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,863
Exactly as I expected and predicted

886
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,191
They're just trying to talk s*** about the Donald

887
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
Mostly Alex

888
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,543
Because my doctor still being a little bit diplomatic

889
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,847
But Alex is just trying to drive traffic

890
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
Exclusively / 2

891
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
To Carpe donktum

892
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,991
I need it it is way to do it

893
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,807
Is to completely lie

894
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
About Reddit

895
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,831
World

896
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,159
Died I agree up

897
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,951
That's his Intro by the way

898
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:20,351
Impossible to respond to

899
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
Really fun to yell at

900
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
People that don't

901
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,823
Reddit reddit

902
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:37,247
Little bit of truth behind this but it's also a big lie

903
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,575
This year the Chinese tech company tencent

904
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,135
Invested 150 million dollars in Reddit

905
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,975
Course that means that they've taken over read it and banned any Trump positive

906
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
Of course the problem in that is

907
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,607
The quarantine of the Donald didn't happen until 4 months later

908
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Read it was super

909
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
Clear that it was because

910
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,447
People on the Donald

911
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
Posted content

912
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
Supposedly advocating

913
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,055
Don't forget about that

914
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,615
Forget about it that's nonsense and bullshittin

915
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:10,783
It was 150 million dollars in investment from a company that is

916
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,111
The Destroyer

917
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
No I'm not

918
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,815
150 million dollars definitely sounds like a lot of money

919
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:28,447
But considered most recent

920
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
Place the site is being worth

921
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,287
3 billion dollars

922
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:37,663
If this involvement even involved

923
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:42,015
A 150 million dollars would be approximately a 5% ownership

924
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,599
Company which is nowhere near enough to unilaterally direct their action

925
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Motivated

926
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,983
The revolution

927
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,335
Explain that in the same round of funding

928
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:11,199
Wright also received an additional 150 million dollars in Investments for burns likes

929
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,271
Rapper Snoop Dogg

930
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,367
Bring up that the majority shareholder in Reddit is Advance

931
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Publication

932
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,439
I may have been for a long time

933
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,767
Parent company of continents

934
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
Who bought Reddit

935
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
2000

936
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,631
Do in 2011

937
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,911
Just became a subsidiary of it

938
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
Publication

939
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
The whole time

940
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,775
Did Alex's loved praise Reddit

941
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,823
The entire time

942
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:44,991
Dikshit their parent company with the same company that owns the New Yorker Vanity Fair

943
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:49,343
Who really Publications is a gigantic media conglomerate

944
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,647
They'll tons of local papers around the country

945
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,695
From Michigan to Alabama to New Jersey

946
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
They own pitchfork

947
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,279
Which recently gave Lana Del Rey's new album

948
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,607
9.4

949
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
Get the f*** out of

950
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,935
There's still the majority shareholder

951
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,007
That wasn't making an investment

952
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Reddit

953
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
That's okay children thing

954
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,591
Do italics is approaching

955
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
Tracing absurdly oversimplified lines

956
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
The causation where they don't exist

957
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,759
Anything to dogs taking responsibility for

958
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
For creating environment

959
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:22,111
4 tons of users felt totally comfortable promoting violence

960
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Probably all the

961
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,767
Yeah yeah every time

962
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:30,815
Corporation

963
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
What they own

964
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
And how in Turkey

965
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Curology

966
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
No no I don't want any of this

967
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,823
Wait till you're saying that also owns this group

968
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,127
But that group owns a subset of other groups

969
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,199
That are their own independence

970
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,223
This group over here

971
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,039
I regret to inform you there is a lot of

972
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
So Alex

973
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,647
Go fly a kite

974
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
Is Chinese Bots Reddit

975
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
So stupid

976
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,071
And February for months later

977
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,095
Quarantine

978
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Happen

979
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
You can't pray the

980
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167
You can't trace a causal

981
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,751
You still could

982
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,591
Disagree

983
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,383
Makes it even more obvious

984
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
The only

985
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
Smartcompany

986
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,759
Make them wait for money

987
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Cupid

988
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,879
My reasoning has been Trump

989
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
So

990
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,255
His message largely is it like they're trying to get rid of me

991
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,327
By getting rid of the Donald

992
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
Basic farming

993
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
Communication

994
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,191
So you give this browsing

995
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
We're going to keep on Mima chill

996
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,759
Morals

997
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,351
Is almost over

998
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:15,007
You hear that we're going to keep doing it and then plug me world man

999
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
Very sad

1000
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
He is losing all those

1001
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:24,479
Cut off by that break after that rousing Braveheart of memes

1002
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,295
He comes back listening to

1003
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
The real classy

1004
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:01,343
Is the Alicia

1005
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:07,999
There's a family show every speculate about what thunder and lightning in The Highwaymen

1006
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,047
Silver Stallion

1007
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:16,959
Waging War on corruption is Alex Jones

1008
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:36,159
Alright okay we got the one

1009
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:40,511
Yeah for me that the Illuminati

1010
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:51,007
This is an Illuminati a or may not be a lifelong love

1011
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:57,407
The second time they asked we don't know what happened

1012
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,735
I can rest easy now knowing

1013
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,551
Norse god Odin

1014
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
It's probably come off as Quirky bulshit

1015
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,671
Where I ain't know where Alex is trying to flex

1016
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:13,279
To completely surface-level knowledge about some Arcane subjects in present

1017
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
He's a religious studies

1018
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,375
That is probably what's going on

1019
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Completely honest

1020
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
However

1021
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:24,799
I should point out that increasingly the religion of choice among white supremacists

1022
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
He's often called

1023
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:30,175
According to a 2017 report from Public Radio International

1024
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
There were at least

1025
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:36,319
6 cases where white supremacist who identified is Odin

1026
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,343
Domestic terror attack

1027
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,135
2001

1028
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:43,231
It is trial Anders Breivik announced that he was a longtime Odin

1029
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
Really f***** up wide identity

1030
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,679
Fun fact

1031
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:55,007
His handgun after Thor's hammer a new car after Odin's horse

1032
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Anyway

1033
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,615
My point here isn't that Alex's talk about Odin because he

1034
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
He's an openness

1035
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,455
I'm saying that I would completely

1036
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:10,111
White identity Focus

1037
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,439
The place where you might find references to Odin

1038
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,463
Suspicious

1039
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,535
Another context this comes off as like a little bit of trivia

1040
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
In this context

1041
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,863
It kind of sounds like it might be a knowing wink

1042
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
But

1043
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:25,215
It's probably just Alex being a blowhard honestly

1044
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,543
I don't think the community but it

1045
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,567
Doesn't look

1046
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
The Highwayman

1047
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,711
Totally

1048
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Kris

1049
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,319
White

1050
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,159
Are we talking blade 1 or Blade 3

1051
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,975
Whitebeard

1052
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
19th Street

1053
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
63

1054
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,607
Is that the old man who fell in love with

1055
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,495
So I want only to be like

1056
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
This is

1057
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,359
It's suspicious only because of the show that Alex does

1058
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:06,175
It's completely innocuous thing to point out like

1059
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,063
Hey there is one ideology that I don't like but there's also one eyes elsewhere

1060
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:17,439
The show that is very

1061
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,023
In line with a lot of white supremacist white identity ideas

1062
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:27,423
He has a guest Vox day who really loves Anders Breivik who is a longtime open it and put the religion

1063
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
Ideology on the map

1064
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
The many ways

1065
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
Sinbad

1066
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,151
Yeah but

1067
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
I shout

1068
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,039
Yeah I mean

1069
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
Spell right

1070
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,207
Might just call it Christian today

1071
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:55,583
So Alex gets back to talking about how wet it's owned by the Chinese

1072
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,399
Play this clip here because

1073
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,191
She's already said but it's important

1074
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
You need to nail down like what he's really trying

1075
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:14,015
Did you know that a communist Chinese control tech company

1076
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,831
In February of this year in Reading

1077
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,391
Guesstimate

1078
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,975
The site was frozen and put in quarantine

1079
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:32,447
He's lying about the investment in order to try and get in remnants

1080
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
Betty has

1081
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:37,823
Crowd to move over to Carpe donktum

1082
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,407
Stop because Alex is associated with Carpe donktum

1083
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,711
That makes him have more

1084
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,271
Adjacency to wear this

1085
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,551
Stop would be happen

1086
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
Is there any like

1087
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
Directions

1088
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,719
You comes on the show more than

1089
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
Make sense

1090
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,791
Yeah but I don't think he's an employer anything

1091
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,863
Memeworld really hard

1092
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
Hosting

1093
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
Immorality

1094
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
Does he have a

1095
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,495
Not that I can tell

1096
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
Just a case of like

1097
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,567
This would really help promote

1098
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:14,687
Yeah it would really be a good advertising Avenue for me

1099
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
Control of someone who is associated with me

1100
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,319
That works better than

1101
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
Dying

1102
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,463
Millions over there

1103
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,255
That's not going to happen but

1104
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,047
It's pretty transparent

1105
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,583
Hey night in the words of Jimmy

1106
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,447
And that's something you just can't buy exactly

1107
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:42,847
Never going to work out very well encapsulated

1108
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:49,759
Start talking about who's creating content for me world this is a wild list

He's agreed to put some kind of

1115
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,359

I when he goes there

01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:11,167
The somebody guy guy who is a f****** walls

1129
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:19,103
Promoting sounds

1130
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,919
This is great to learn the guys

1131
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,735
When are you don't use real names

1132
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,527
State fair fair I apologize

1133
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:33,183
Not too long ago we heard Alex talking about how he wasn't going

1134
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:33,951
Exist in a year

1135
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,511
Infowars

1136
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:40,863
65 days and I'm pretty glad that we approached

1137
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,959
I think that we thought there was

1138
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,519
Possibility

1139
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,055
More likely it was bulshit

1140
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:52,127
And the way he talks about his sales

1141
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,919
Right here this next clip

1142
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,711
Leave me to believe that it was probably

1143
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,975
People wait for Sino

1144
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
That is put me into a pickle

1145
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:15,167
40%

1146
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:22,079
So he's talking about the sales that they'll have next year which implies that they'll be around next year and that there will have products

1147
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
Nexteer

1148
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,663
Also I don't know how good it is to be like

1149
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:30,783
We're be around but hey I'll sales are not going to be as good

1150
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:35,391
You're going to pay more for the prices

1151
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
Yeah I f***** up by selling stuff

1152
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,535
Unsustainable

1153
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
As a

1154
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,607
Reproach

1155
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Now it's not

1156
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:49,727
So it's Alex yells about how

1157
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
He's lucky

1158
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
The Chinese haven't killed

1159
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
That is good

1160
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
I think we're all Lucky

1161
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Chucky 7

1162
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,967
TheCHIVE

1163
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,247
Gmail

1164
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,951
Diarrhea

1165
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,471
But it's true

1166
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,823
It's no coincidence that

1167
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,639
Within a month or so of

1168
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
Of their investment

1169
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,967
That suddenly

1170
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,807
Subject has been

1171
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
Extra for years suddenly just

1172
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,159
Gets quarantined

1173
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
Zoe

1174
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:47,327
Has every reason to know that this timeline isn't true he absolutely he is someone who's involved

1175
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:53,727
And the Donald

1176
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,007
We reason to know when

1177
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
The investment happened and compare it to when the quarantine

1178
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,639
I came around you know that it wasn't within a month

1179
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,199
He's just parroting back Alex is talking point

1180
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,991
Because it makes a better argument

1181
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,295
And that's not true they are lying

1182
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
That's the only reason

1183
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
Riveting

1184
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,327
I mean he's so good that he's decided to make memes

1185
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
Alex

1186
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:24,959
Now descends into like yelling about the Chinese

1187
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
The bunch

1188
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,031
Another

1189
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:34,431
Dragon video

1190
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,503
Has another day gone

1191
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
Let him doing it defensive

1192
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Character

1193
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,159
Is that a new that's the new like you've got a face for radio is it

1194
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
You got a voice for me

1195
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,255
Steve level for me

1196
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
So I hear that Alex

1197
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Complaining

1198
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
Vagina

1199
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,359
So this is a big headline that he repeats all the time

1200
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,663
I know that it's not

1201
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:08,223
Truth I haven't really got into it

1202
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,015
Brookside what the f*** let's talk about

1203
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
Washington Post

1204
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,647
And Alex wants the headlines

1205
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,671
Crush Trump

1206
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:22,047
Because Alex wants the perception to be that the mainstream media has bacon the foreign leader to destroy Trump

1207
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,631
This service is Market strategy of maligning all not Infowars

1208
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,911
Adjacent media

1209
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
And you know it works

1210
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,751
However the actual headline is quote

1211
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,775
Geez choice

1212
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,335
Destroy Trump

1213
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,383
This was not a news article

1214
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,407
It wasn't

1215
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,479
Which naturally is where Alex takes most of his headline

1216
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
3 protons are news article

1217
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
Now just go to the

1218
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:48,671
Find something sounds weird Al about it

1219
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
Opinions

1220
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,975
Is entirely about

1221
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
Clickbait

1222
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Then the other side going

1223
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,863
And then you writing another opinion

1224
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,239
Has Rolling Meadows on its own a Brazen Act of manipulation

1225
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:05,823
Legitimately doesn't understand the difference

1226
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
Journalism and commentary

1227
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,663
And I would say that

1228
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,687
Probably

1229
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,455
It could be

1230
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
The editorial

1231
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:19,391
Question needs to learn how to use soft power if he's going to maximize maximize his success

1232
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,671
As a world leader

1233
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
Note

1234
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
A leader

1235
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,743
Not v l

1236
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
That's important

1237
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:31,935
It runs through how dealing with India internal dissent in Hong Kong are all examples that make his leadership style not one

1238
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:36,543
That makes China really qualified to be government the world looks on with budget

1239
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,591
Probably FairPoint

1240
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:44,479
The stuff about Trump is towards the end of the editorial to headline

1241
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,527
To reflect the actual article itself

1242
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:51,903
The argument here is that she is holding all the cards as it relates

1243
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,999
The only move Trump realistically has

1244
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,815
In terms of their relation is threatening a trade War

1245
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,887
And she doesn't really care about that nearly as much as Trump

1246
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,191
Show me article

1247
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:10,591
60% of whom spent less than $10 a day are far more accustomed to economic pain than Trump

1248
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
And they have no meaningful right to vote

1249
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,551
So she can probably afford to absorb some economic pain necessary to push the trade War past election

1250
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,135
It's all presented as the choice between soft and hard power

1251
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,439
The harp our route would be to crush

1252
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:28,511
Enforces hand with a trade war that would likely

1253
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,839
L recession and diminish Trump's chances of being re-elected

1254
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,655
The soft power route is to make some token

1255
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:38,751
Concessions the Trump could parade around and act like he's a master negotiator forgetting

1256
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,799
As the article says quote

1257
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,823
Graciously spring

1258
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,847
Trump from the trap

1259
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
Keith stepka

1260
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,687
This is ultimately weaken our ability to negotiate

1261
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,991
Further but gives trumpet artificial

1262
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,551
Can't save Trump and weaken America

1263
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,855
The editorial is not a call for G2

1264
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,927
Cross-draw but you'd only think that if you hadn't read the article

1265
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,231
Or you have and you know your audience

1266
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Isn't going to

1267
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,815
Either way I was just completely lying about this s***

1268
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,607
In order to Moline that the Washington

1269
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Supposed to

1270
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
His

1271
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,215
Mainstream media rivals

1272
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,543
You know I really loved

1273
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,919
Huge fan of all the really really

1274
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:25,855
Yeah it's trouble like the problem solves itself if people just read

1275
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,903
Like if they read the articles

1276
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,951
The problem of bad headlines

1277
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,815
Kind of solves itself whenever

1278
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Materialize

1279
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,911
It's a problem

1280
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,495
The screaming about how like

1281
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,775
The world is madness

1282
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
And no one cares

1283
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,871
The Chinese bar

1284
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:54,527
I mean we got other s*** going on man

1285
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
You know

1286
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,951
Do your magic no one cares

1287
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,511
But don't care because the thing didn't happen

1288
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:09,887
Alex turns heat along the American people

1289
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Men

1290
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
We have a country

1291
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
A little

1292
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,527
Fidgets

1293
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:33,439
Growlers and ass kissers public about week

1294
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Devil worship

1295
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,471
I thought you loved America what are you doing I mean

1296
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
Well

1297
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
This is Family Show

1298
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
Bright

1299
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,639
Did normal Americans are devil worshippers

1300
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,223
God unmasked

1301
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:02,623
Like a guy who likes America by

1302
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,743
Seems like that for the entire time

1303
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
Talking about him

1304
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:12,351
America that is

1305
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:15,423
No I really really hate that kind

1306
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Douching

1307
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,215
Despises

1308
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:20,031
But he really loves the one that's in his head

1309
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,591
Betty would like to impose upon everybody else without their

1310
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
It is very quite

1311

Asterisk

1314
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,527
The one in his brain that nobody else is aware

1315
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:36,927
Yeah I noticed that a lot of the show's been about climate change and yelling about Greta thunberg

1316
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
Now

1317
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,975
With a little

1318
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
In the in the way

1319
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Right

1320
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:45,119
Which was a good diversion pressing issue of climate

1321
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,911
Sure do that

1322
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,727
Alex is like greater doesn't know what the f*** she's talking about

1323
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,519
But I know a guy who does

1324
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:55,615
Oh no

1325
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,175

Still have some hair left and

1329
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,071
Prefer not to watch me rip it out and

1330
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,119
But I did like

1331
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,191
Lord monckton knows more than Mark Moreno like that's going

1332
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:27,103
Why not because he's over my parade

1333
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:37,599
Any reference would piss you off

1334
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,903
So the reason that Alex has

1335
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
Is because

1336
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:47,583
I guess Lord monckton has branded himself a Greta thunberg expert

1337
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:52,703
Alex multiple times and he just seems like

1338

And I told you I found

1418
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,208
Perhaps the most f*****-up clip that I've ever heard of the show

1419
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,512
Somali pirates is definitely in the Run

1420
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,144
The one where you talked about being on Artie and then being intelligent people

1421
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,728
That was weird

1422
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:45,312
This one is definitely up there

1423
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,336
Big is this

1424
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Is

1425
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,128
Crazy

1426
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920

That

1430
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
Is mind-blowing

1431
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:12,704
That didn't look there are red flags and then there are red flags

1432
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,520
What is the post scholar on US History think Smith

1433
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,056
Presidents who have been impeached

1434
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:21,152
Arrowhead proceedings open up on them are Clinton Trump and Jefferson Davis

1435
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
Like 41

1436
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,576
List is actually Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton for those who have been impeached

1437
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:34,208
Even that listed leaving office open but was never impeached

1438
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,000
Most importantly

1439
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:40,096
Was not a president of United States

1440
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,912

1441
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:48,544

1445
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,392
First of all the Alex

Which is not not good that's not good.

1449
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:16,960
Also it means he's really f****** stupid cuz he forgot about Nixon

1450
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
I understand

1451
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,872
They started

1452
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:35,392
Nixon had the articles of impeachment brought to the house

1453
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,440
A list of

1454
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,744
The point

1455
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,792
These are big

1456
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Things

1457
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,864
Then he should remember

1458
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
Pics of

1459
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,960

1460
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
Considering

1461
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
Time

1462
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
When

1463
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,544
Andrew Johnson

Contemporary

1466
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
So

1467
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
A kind of

1468
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:09,440
America during the time of Jefferson Davis was an ill

1469
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,232
Legitimate America in dust

1470
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,512

Just to show you that he doesn't correct

1478
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,576
Himself because you would think

1479
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,344
If he said that

1480
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,624
You would then be like

1481
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,184
I f***** up yeah completely clogged up

1482
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952

1484
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360

Approval rating

1486
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
When he did this

1487
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
So he doesn't

1488
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,000
Seem to even recognize that he said the Jefferson Davis was

1489
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,048
Who's the president of the United States

1490
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,840
Really f****** troubling

Going to be hilarious

1493
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,616
But never in my wildest dreams would I have

1494
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,640
Come up with Jeffers

1495
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432

1497
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,832
According to 538 Trump's numbers disappeared make a little stick upwards

1498
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,648
Recent days but you still looking at net

1499
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
Negative

1500
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,208
Approval rating which is not ideal

1501
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,168
Text out that is

1502
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:55,936
Not just now

1503
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
Something that I do

1504
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
Don't care about

1505
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,288
Thing that is actively harmful if

1506
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
If you care about

1507
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,872
His

1508
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,944
F****** of approval rating

1509
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,480
In the

1510
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,528
A criminal trial

1511
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,344
I don't care whether or not

1512
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
The f******

1513
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,160
Jury like

1514
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,720
The defendant the problem is the crime

1515
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:23,840
Yeah you're not judging you approve of the job

1516
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
Right

1517
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:28,960
Seems that way

1518
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:32,288
But Alex doesn't

1519
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,592
And here's why

1520
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,968
The Deep state is making it right now

1521
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,504
Free Society

1522
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:45,344
This is a major question and you saw that incredible speech

1523
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
President

1524
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,304
Why the systems coming after him because

1525
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,888
And parlayed our military

1526
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,520
So it's retaliation

1527
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,824
This is all just for Trump

1528
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,128
We just make sense

1529
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
The

1530
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,432
Just started before

1531
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:17,856
I guess he's being it

1532
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,720
That wasn't

1533
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,792
To release this map

1534
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,608
Clearly

1535
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
Certainly handle implies it

1536
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,264
Because

1537
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,848
I don't know

1538
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,920
I don't know about the memo

1539
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:46,784
Alright I want a little bit before we get to that Alex

1540
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,112
So recently there was

1541
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,904
News about

1542
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,440
People warning

1543
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,232
There might be a shooting

1544
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
Premiere of The Joker movie

1545
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,864
Aurora Theater would not show

1546
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
But if I recall correctly

1547
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,704
I will not be surprised

1548
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,984
See that but that wouldn't

1549
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,008
Surprise me too much

1550
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:12,128
Alex believes the global is signaling that they're going to do a false flag

1551
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,456
This that movie

1552
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:19,296
About this a little bit something really interesting

1553
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
It's worth pointing out

1554
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,624
President

1555
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,976
Getting Love Of The Nation

1556
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:34,912
Emergency alert

1557
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
Cell

1558
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,712
I didn't know that they were a cross-pollinating

1559
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,528
Battle

1560
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,320
Nonexistent

1561
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,856
Loosely affiliated

1562
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,392
Group of people that are

1563
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
Demonized by the right

1564
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,464
And then the other one is a bunch of

1565
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,536
You're going to get shot by

1566
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:05,632
Sarah never ever shooting

1567
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:12,544
That's because if there are

1568
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,568
Clarence Alpha profit

1569
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:19,456
The Army did release a warning to service people that they picked up chatter from the dark web about shooting

1570
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,992
Screening of the Joker

1571
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
Relating to insult

1572
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:27,136
Who spoke to Gizmodo said that these sorts of alerts are pretty common

1573
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:32,000
Email that got sent out

1574
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,792
Specific threat that anyone could take action

1575
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,584
They just advised avigilon

1576
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:42,752
There's nothing in that armies email or the FBI statement on the dark web chatter that would leave

1577
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:43,520
Fashion

1578
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:47,872
This is specifically about incel groups but without

1579
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,920
Make a compound epithet

1580
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,992
In order to

1581
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:53,760
This is mine

1582
01:28:54,016 --> 01:29:00,160
He does this regularly in order to demonize groups that he's opposed to most notably with his attempt to make the lgbtq

1583
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,440
T2p thing

1584
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
I work

1585
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,280
You know trying to reflect his completely erroneous claim

1586
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:08,864
The lgbtq community adopted pedophilia into their rank

1587
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,192
This is the level of s*** that Alex is working with these

1588
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,984
Just trying to create

1589
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752
Epithet

1590
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,312
To demonize groups

1591
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,592
Just linguistic

1592
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,664
Yeah it's really pathetic it's a sign

1593
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,456
Not

1594
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,248
Really having much gas left

1595
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,552
I'm just confused

1596
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
I think that would be a good idea

1597
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
Considering incel

1598
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,952
The Intel community

1599
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
Woodcare

1600
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,424
Like anybody who

1601
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,496
The s*** is going to give a s*** about what the right-wing says about

1602
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:55,200
Are far more likely to support Alex there on his the Donald

1603
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,736
You know there's some

1604
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,808
Play there's so many in that Community is like

1605
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:04,416
Maybe well

1606
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,696
Compared to Earth

1607
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,304
But I'm asking

1608
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,352
You know they they don't

1609
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,400
Ascribed right

1610
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:17,728
Ideas about virility and the energy produced

1611
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,032
Being so Central to what do you want

1612
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,312
These people to be

1613
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,104
Yeah now that you say that

1614
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,640
I can see that

1615
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,712
But

1616
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:29,248
It's still just dumb

1617
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,016
This is all stupid

1618
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,160
I don't know probably about a half hour or so realizes that

1619
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,440
He said the Jefferson Davis was

1620
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
Was president

1621
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:38,976
Red State

1622
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,000
Any comes back today

1623
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,560
Fourth impeachment

1624
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,192
420 is Trump

1625
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
So we're going to be looking at

1626
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:53,056
All of that Johnsonville Clinton and others

1627
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,592
I suggest

1628
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,760
McDonald's purpose

1629
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:08,160
He said it for some reason for some reason

1630
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,952
That he would even say not on purpose

1631
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,280
That works

1632
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:19,680
I didn't mean to tell you what's going on in my brain and that's all Confederate ships

1633
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:26,080
It wasn't completely muscle memory reaction that I have

1634
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,920
Confederacy of the United States president

1635
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,712
Alex

1636
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
That is great

1637
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
Style

1638
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:40,672
I promise to get to Alex's take on the memo

1639
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,952
It's not good

1640
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:02,688
Nothing

1641
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,736
The shareholders

1642
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,016
Sanford

1643
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,064
Partial ownership

1644
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,416
Put it on the board

1645
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:18,048
This whistleblower puts in the complaint

1646
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:28,032
Intelligence says that's not a legitimate complaint nothing wrong with

1647
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,176
Please don't throw me in the Briar Patch

1648
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,184
Level four

1649
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,816
People up what a shock that reference becomes up with to describe the situation

1650
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:03,104
Splash Mountain or something like that the president United States

1651
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,992
Really

1652
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,488
It's not right

1653
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
Text David

1654
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:28,192
So Alex is conspiracy theory here is the trumpet playing games trying to get this whistleblower to testify

1655
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:32,032
Open the door to talk about the family's involvement in Ukraine

1656
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:35,360
Hey Joe Biden's involvement in the firing of grains former

1657
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,896
Prosecutor Victor show

1658
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:41,504
All that information is already very public

1659
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:48,160
James rice and wrote a story about Joe's done hunt in 2015

1660
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,184
New York Times

1661
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:54,048
Anime 2019 you right-wing sites were already aggressively circulating the accusation

1662
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,632
He'd gotten the prosecutor fired in order to bail out

1663
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
Ukraine

1664
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:02,496
The idea that company The Whistleblower to

1665
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:05,056
In order to get this information into the open

1666
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
Absurd

1667
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,104
Just makes no sense

1668
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:13,504
Replace back up his claim Lee all about

1669
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,112
Is a Cooper Biden saying that he threatened to withhold a billion dollars in Aid if they

1670
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,136
Fire shokin

1671
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,672
And that is a real quick

1672
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,720
However what's missing is

1673
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,488
Contacts

1674
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,792
Here are the parts of the story that are

1675
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,840
Did work

1676
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,120
To get Viktor shokin fired

1677
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Missing Ukraine

1678
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,288
The rest of this narrative that is completely fabric

1679
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,848
Joe Biden

1680
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,664
Most of them not good but in this case

1681
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,224
Experts agree that he was in the right to threaten to withhold

1682
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,504
Unless shokin was fired

1683
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,808
It was deeply corrupt

1684
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,648
Installing avert prosecution on

1685
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:55,744
What are the big prosecution's was that

1686
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
Nicolas

1687
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
Lorraine crane

1688
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,376
Biggest independent Gas Company burisma

1689
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,424
This was a bit of a mess

1690
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,032
The shefsky was also yanukovych's

1691
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,080
Environment and natural resources

1692
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,896
Would you get imagine could introduce a prime opportunity

1693
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,968
Felix

1694
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
The energy

1695
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,784
Conglomerate there

1696
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,832
Well as the guy in charge of

1697
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,392
And natural

1698
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,976
What kind of ridiculous

1699
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,256
Backwards ass country

1700
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:34,400
They're f****** regulator

1701
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
What

1702
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,216
Hahaha

1703
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,544
Not investigate or prosecute cases

1704
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,312
Cuz like that

1705
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,104
Which is what

1706
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,152
In exchange for the delivery

1707
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:51,808
So now the story The right-wing media conspired in order to protect his son Hunter who

1708
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,880
Was involved in business in Ukraine

1709
01:35:55,392 --> 01:36:01,024
I should probably tell you that the sketchy business in Ukraine that Joe son was involved with none other than burisma

1710
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,584
The very company that was insisting

1711
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,120
Be fired for not investor

1712
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:09,216
The Narrative completely falls apart when you realize the actual pieces

1713
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
That were in play

1714
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,288
The factors that were involved

1715
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:17,408
Nobody people of theorize that buries them is hiring of Joe Hunter Biden

1716
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,456
Might have been an attempt to Shield the company

1717
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,736
Impossible empty corrupt

1718
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
Crackdown

1719
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,296
But there's no evidence

1720
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,832
Played out in the real world

1721
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,416
So to sum things up I'll quote from an article in the interest

1722
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,208
Ricin

1723
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,280
Webbie interview

1724
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,328
The founder of Ukraine's auntie

1725
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
Corruption action

1726
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,680
What I'm pissed off about is that show can who is

1727
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,448
Totally corrupt

1728
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,496
To undermine the reform of prosecution

1729
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,264
Performers

1730
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,568
And who didn't want to investigate the shepsky

1731
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,848
Now appears in

1732
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,616
New York Times

1733
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
Article

1734
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:54,784
As the hero who wanted to investigate is olszewski a yzma and who suffered because Joe bike demanded

1735
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,552
To dismiss him

1736
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,832
Because of his willingness

1737
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,904
Charisma which is absolute nonsense

1738
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,464
Absolutely did not

1739
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,000
Set the up Democrats or Biden

1740
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:06,048
And find any faith left in the process

1741
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,352
I would think he's in very serious trouble

1742
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
And this week s*** is the only spend that

1743
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
They have life

1744
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,032
You got you got a lot of really bad looking variables but I've been

1745
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,336
We've done this too many times

1746
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:21,152
The course of the last two years for me to be like

1747
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,200
Anytime

1748
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,760
I'm done with people who are

1749
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,320
This would take down any normal president

1750
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,392
Like this would take down a present

1751
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,208
Cannot take down the f******

1752
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:36,256
Criminal terrorist Enterprise that the

1753
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
Do Europeans turn into

1754
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,584
The president has nothing to do with how

1755
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,352
How corrupt in all

1756
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:43,424
Well

1757
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
But he's just a

1758
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,216
He's just a manaphy

1759
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
Gestation of

1760
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Yeah

1761
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312
The.

1762
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,336
Has Fallen

1763
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,384
Amazing

1764
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,712
For the first time

1765
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
I think

1766
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,296
This one in

1767
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
I think they're

1768
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,904
You very

1769
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
The GOP

1770
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
Power structure

1771
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,768
Who read that

1772
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,072
It heard that Balboa

1773
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
The whole thing is really

1774
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
Oh no

1775
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,472
We tricked ourselves

1776
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:20,288
F*** now we believe this

1777
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,336
No we were using that to

1778
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:25,152
To trick the dump

1779
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,944
Yeah

1780
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,736
Yeah it's it's

1781
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,808
It's a bridge

1782
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,088
Too far I think

1783
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,624
4

1784
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,184
I don't know I don't have

1785
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,720
I don't have a whole lot of faith

1786
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:40,768
Slitherio

1787
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,584
But I hope that it's enough to

1788
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,120
Really Joplin

1789
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:45,888
Out of

1790
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
Believing

1791
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,728
The b******* line I really hope it is

1792
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,008
Because it's

1793
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:52,800
Who year

1794
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,592
Some of the factors that are

1795
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:59,456
From the reporting that come out about

1796
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:05,856
The Whistleblower report just got released

1797
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,624
Matches up with

1798
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,904
Reporting it come out

1799
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,720
That's a prior to the phone call that Trump had

1800
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:13,024
With Ukrainian president

1801
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,608
Specifically

1802
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,656
Put a hold on a

1803
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,448
Prior to this phone call

1804
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:26,848
Not after not during no preliminary

1805
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,640
Which states

1806
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:32,736
The phone call and messaging

1807
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,016
You want

1808
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:38,112
Is Saint and the b*******

1809
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392
So like

1810
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,976
All of these things a reasonable person would look at that

1811
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,560
Conclusion

1812
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:49,120
There's enough here that really needs to be sorted out

1813
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,656
This is untoward

1814
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,448
And if allowed to stand

1815
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
Is just

1816
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
Suspicious

1817
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,080
Oh no

1818
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,616
There was a literal

1819
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,384
Violation of

1820
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,152
The emolument clause

1821
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:13,184
It's not a transcript

1822
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,536
The Trump slipped

1823
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:28,800
Trump Hotel

1824
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:38,272
No that was also reading bad read that memo is very much

1825
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:39,808
It is

1826
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,928
Is Stevi B's right the Ukrainian president lines hear the dialogue on that

1827
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
Is Soco

1828
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
Clearly

1829
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,280
Literally going like

1830
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,072
How do we get him to pay attention

1831
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,864
We flatter the s*** out of

1832
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,192
Right right right

1833
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,496
Craigslist

1834
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,264
Is a

1835
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,080
Comedian

1836
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
You can pull that show

1837
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
Yeah it's

1838
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,176
It's troubling

1839
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,456
It's all just

1840
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Real trouble

1841
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,016
My feeling

1842
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,112
It's the sign that every other country

1843
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,928
What we all should

1844
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,696
We don't already

1845
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
F****** pathetic weak-willed

1846
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,280
Tiny little baby hookah

1847
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,048
He stroked his ego

1848
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,840
Will do whatever you want

1849
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,888
And it becomes

1850
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,680
Machine

1851
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,728
Exactly it's it's

1852
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:34,848
But look at all the available evidence

1853
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:40,992
Kind of feeling

1854
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,600
So we have a lot of feelings about this

1855
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:49,184
Medications that are coming out aren't good and make it look like there's probably

1856
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,464
Real bad thing

1857
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:54,560
Confident that everything's cool

1858
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,168
What Trump said last year also Foods left

1859
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:04,288
I would anyway go over the phone

1860
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
No way shooter

1861
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:15,296
Easily torn and honest man

1862
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,112
Isaac all stories of con

1863
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:24,512
Is there a run on on at Regal

1864
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:27,072
Conning honest man

1865
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:32,448
The only don't want to talk to you at all

1866
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:38,080
This is all not true because Trump said I don't commit crimes on the phone

1867
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,184
It's a routine

1868
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,448
So Alex needs to Center this around by

1869
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:10,848
A projecting onto Trump crimes that bike committed so they could deflect from the

1870
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,384
The fact that he committed those crimes

1871
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:16,224
I tried to take out Trump

1872
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,040
It sort of capitulate

1873
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,184
Best Buy

1874
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:39,008
Now it's important to point out that in the clip it out to talk

1875
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:44,384
I'm about you never says because you're investigating my son editorial

1876
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,920
Theory

1877
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:52,320
Bulshit being applied to the actual

1878
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,936
If you don't

1879
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:14,080
Terrible story

1880
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,104
Is that true

1881
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,480
I hate

1882
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:25,600
Investigation

1883
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,392
Something happened

1884
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:29,440
Such a lovely

1885
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,536
Right

1886
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,328
Is there such b*******

1887
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,400
What's plays the actual clip of Biden

1888
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,240
I don't care

1889
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,544
I'm not into him at all I don't care

1890
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,736
Find anything

1891
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,784
Necessarily wrong with what it says

1892
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,992
And

1893
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:29,344
I remember going over convention

1894
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,416
Convincing us that we should be providing for

1895
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,720
It's Not Over

1896
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:38,816
1213 time to keys and ducks

1897
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:43,424
And I was going to supposed to announce that there's another

1898
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:53,152
Prosecutor

1899
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:16,448
The prosecutors not fired

1900
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,688
Each other's ass

1901
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,968
So

1902
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:34,368
It matches up with Alex's narrative he didn't sell

1903
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:37,184
I was working at a sketchy company Ukraine

1904
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:42,816
I didn't do that he's not saying that he did it to stall the prosecution that's built that b*******

1905
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:43,840
Sweet spin

1906
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,864
Nonsense

1907
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,888
Specifically

1908
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,656
He's saying that

1909
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,936
They were the ones

1910
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:48,960
Who forced him

1911
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:50,496
Like the deal was already done

1912
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:54,080
He was he was never he didn't plan on doing any

1913
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,640
That was already negotiated

1914
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,712
They just changed the deal at the last

1915
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:00,736
Then he went

1916
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,016
No

1917
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,552
That was that was it

1918
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:07,392
What kind of Investigation that's done

1919
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,672
Which I think is always

1920
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,976
Appropriate if they're done

1921
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,536
To reflect

1922
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,560
Like

1923
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,376
Hail Mary desperate attempt

1924
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
Create cover

1925
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,936
The only reason you do that is if

1926
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:20,960
You know you need to cover

1927
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,008
And that's probably what

1928
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,544
What's going on

1929
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,824
This is

1930
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Best moments

1931
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,640
Poor

1932
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,480
On the fox

1933
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,248
News media

1934
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:38,624
This is the this is the when push comes to shove

1935
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,160
You're holding up a memo

1936
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,696
Trump saying

1937
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,720
I committed

1938
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,280
Look

1939
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
Putting it in people's face

1940
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:47,840
And thanks

1941
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,120
He didn't commit

1942
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:52,192
For people who love to yell about 1984

1943
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,984
It's interesting

1944
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
Ecclesia

1945
01:47:55,776 --> 01:48:01,664
We live in a cliche and this is that last moment before it's like there's no coming back guys now you believe whatever the

1946
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:04,480
Is he can put an apple in your

1947
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:05,504
Come out and say it

1948
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,528
If an orange and your

1949
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,856
I agree

1950
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:12,416
So Alex Barnes on

1951
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,976
Barnes-joseph

1952
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:18,048
Alex

1953
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:21,888
Because what you haven't talked about how he's doing

1954
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,984
But Alex

1955
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:26,752
Like I said

1956
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
Has a priorities

1957
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,912
I mean

1958
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:01,824
I would say that that's probably an accurate reflection of what you should be covering your own Petty both or

1959
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,104
Duration of our country

1960
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,408
You like that

1961
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:06,944
Really close

1962
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,248
It is not it is not a disc

1963
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:12,576
No like that was neck-and-neck finish right there

1964
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,880
Barnes all day about

1965
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,464
Yeah

1966
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:21,024
Yeah it's it's pretty crazy

1967
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:24,096
I need to say this really quick just off the top

1968
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:27,936
Video people listen to our show

1969
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,960
Which they do not

1970
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:30,240
I need to say this

1971
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,288
Please do not cover these lawsuit

1972
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:38,432
If someone was a pretty good handle on Alex's current situation in life it's hard not to see these as an attempt

1973
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,712
Ag Supply

1974
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:43,552
And further as an attempt to obfuscate his main Sandy Hook lost

1975
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,136
It's my feeling people would be wise

1976
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,672
To leave these cases alone

1977
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:50,720
Let them run their course and not give out

1978
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,000
Exactly what do you want

1979
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
Which is tons

1980
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,048
Coverage of these cases

1981
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,584
Even if the coverage is mocking

1982
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:59,936
He needs an inflow of people to his sight in order to be potential customers

1983
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:03,008
No matter how he get that info he doesn't give a s***

1984
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,032
And this stuff

1985
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:04,800
Reek

1986
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:09,920
Alex The Young Turks Brianna Wu and Andrew Kimmel on Wednesday

1987
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,200
And I've read the complaint

1988
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,992
Hi my first thought is

1989
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,552
Was written by Robert Barnes

1990
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,928
Generally when I read legal filings for the show the very dry really formal and by-the-book

1991
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,952
This one is

1992
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:26,048
He let the crowd vote on how it was going to say my toes

1993
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:30,912
It does include Barnes big catchphrase couple times

1994
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:31,936
Saul Good

1995
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:36,800
What essential problem with this argument relies on a

1996
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,616
From the filing

1997
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Parents

1998
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:43,456
School shootings has employer

1999
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:47,552
After the suit was brought hackers and cybercriminals ideologically aligned with a

2000
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,576
Descendants

2001
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,136
The computers of Joneses

2002
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:56,000
Employer during the time. Does he unwittingly quote-unquote discovered

2003
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,792
Lawyers involved in the case

2004
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:02,400
By using terms in the emails that have been ordered produced by court order discovery

2005
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,448
It's very clear the barn

2006
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:10,592
Coordination between the people who's doing out

2007
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,664
I mean you put the word discovered in quotes

2008
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,712
As if to say there wasn't a real discovery

2009
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:20,064
NFL lawyers and do what they do because the hackers were their ideological allies

2010
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,880
All right here's how this here's how we go

2011
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,160
Let's Roll

2012
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
Okay alright

2013
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,512
So

2014
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,280
Here's what

2015
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,096
Shadowy Bando hacker

2016
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,888
They got together they

2017
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,472
Elkhorn computers

2018
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
At the behest of

2019
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,568
And I'm not going to say who but there happened

2020
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,592
Another group

2021
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,384
People suing Alex and

2022
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,944
I'm just saying there evolved

2023
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,712
Anybody out there

2024
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:51,552
It was all of there it was all that

2025
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:57,952
We got to take down The Young Turks completely unfounded and unproven disconnect

2026
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,304
The violin

2027
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:08,704
Ocean. Infowars Corporate email accounts were attacked by online cybercriminals

2028
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:12,800
With spyware and malware

2029
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:15,104
Including Sandy Hook

2030
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:21,504
Hidden embedded in the emails that hackers sent to various Infowars email address

2031
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:24,576
The emails were never opened by anyone at Infowars

2032
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:27,136
The court in the Sandy Hook

2033
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:31,232
Emails included

2034
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,000
Sandy Hook

2035
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:34,048
It appears the hackers who tried to

2036
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:37,888
Emails on Infowars servers were aware of this discovery process

2037
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:41,728
It deliberately using terms in emails to create a false counter

2038
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:47,360
This seems incredibly speculative isn't information to be included in your legal filing

2039
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:51,456
The basis for framing Alex is a pitiable victim is being laid out

2040
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:57,600
Ernest setup between

2041
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,904
Does canceling the hackers weather formal or not

2042
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,208
There is there's this idea that's being presented

2043
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,232
2 gear and it's just

2044
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,536
Pure speculation that's meant to opt

2045
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,096
As always I'm no lawyer

2046
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,656
But this seems deeply irresponsible as a way to

2047
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,680
You frame your legal

2048
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,216
Go complain

2049
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:13,984
What is he asked

2050
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,288
What what is with the lawsuit

2051
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,360
They want to trial against

2052
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,640
These three Defenders

2053
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,176
The Young Turks

2054
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:23,456
Brianna Wu

2055
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,224
Fans

2056
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,504
For what

2057
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,576
For saying that Alex sent child born

2058
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,160
Defamation

2059
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
Gotcha gotcha

2060
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,120
Hear what these folks over is headline statements that

2061
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:43,936
On a purely technical

2062
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:48,800
However barnes's big move on page three of the filing

2063
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,848
Is to argue that Alex didn't

2064
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,664
His employer Infowars turned over emails

2065
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,688
The plaintiff lawyers

2066
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:00,064
And Alex Jones is the owner of Infowars

2067
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:04,160
So I feel like that argument might be a little thick

2068
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,232
Play from

2069
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:09,280
His name was in all caps

2070
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,328
So it's actually the states

2071
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,888
Alex Jones

2072
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,448
From what I understand might have

2073
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,544
Sovereign ideas about taxes.

2074
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,152
Okay so we can look for

2075
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,944
And his meteoric rise

2076
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:30,016
Shortly after

2077
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,040
10 years in jail for

2078
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,576
Who knows

2079
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,112
The only exhibit

2080
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:38,464
Is a screenshot of a tweet from The Young Turks

2081
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:42,560
Lincoln to a video titled Alex Jones

2082
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:47,424
Ignore Andrew

2083
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:51,008
But I think there might be another thing this document that is a gigantic red flag

2084
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
Listed in the case

2085
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,152
Are The Young Turks

2086
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:58,944
Brianna Wu and Andrew Campbell

2087
01:54:59,456 --> 01:54:59,968
However

2088
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:03,296
In the nature of the action section of the filing

2089
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:07,648
Details about The Young Turks

2090
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,952
But there's nothing about

2091
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:10,720
A camel

2092
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,280
There's a complaint about Larkspur

2093
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,096
Who's not listed as a defendant

2094
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:18,144
What

2095
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,800
Forgot

2096
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,848
I'm not sure it's very confusing

2097
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,872
And probably not a good

2098
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,200
Lazy motherfukers

2099
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:39,392
I think there might be some implication that Andrew Kimmel wrote for Mother Jones

2100
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,952
Stop about somebody else

2101
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:46,560
In the nature of the action part 180 is the defend I don't

2102
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,352
Seems

2103
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,632
This is

2104
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,400
Same like

2105
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:52,960
The Republican

2106
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,032
Accidentally sent to ya

2107
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:59,872
The criminal mastermind that is just

2108
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:00,640
Absolutely

2109
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:03,968
Oh yeah

2110
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,248
It's even more it's

2111
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
Even more of an insult

2112
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,624
Here's some random thoughts I have about this case that I

2113
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,928
T-top for Alex

2114
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,232
1

2115
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:20,608
In claiming that this is defamation Barnes tries to argue that this is negatively affected Alex's

2116
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,680
I think it's going to be insanely hard to prove

2117
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,984
Reputation is s***

2118
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,776
And 42 because Alex

2119
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:31,616
I remember him saying he was doing better after the corn attack

2120
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:34,944
Like the audience

2121
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:41,856
There are things from Alta show that could be used very easily as like

2122
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,720
His reputation

2123
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:49,536
Solo among the rest of the world

2124
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:51,584
It could only be raised

2125
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,352
Biax

2126
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,704
People among the people who follow

2127
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:03,616
Interana second in terms of the specific statement quote Alex Jones

2128
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:07,456
Like if you accept it enforces all by Alex at the lawyers work

2129
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,992
For Sandy Hook parents

2130
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
Think that's technically.

2131
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:14,368
The Young Turks

2132
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:16,672
It doesn't necessarily imply that Alex knew what was

2133
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,720
It doesn't apply

2134
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:21,280
Really hard time arguing

2135
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:23,328
But this is a defamatory

2136
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:26,400
Really steals defamatory to Alex

2137
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:33,568
When we covered the story was my position that sing I'll accept this torn with a bit of a sensational

2138
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,104
I thought

2139
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,176
True

2140
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:40,480
It's still probably didn't capture the reality of the story

2141
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,088
I took the position that it wasn't a good headline story

2142
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:46,368
And I was probably kind of

2143
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,392
The clickbait behavior

2144
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,184
But I don't think you can sue someone

2145
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,464
And if you can

2146
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,792
Alex Verdugo scrub literally all the contact off Infowars

2147
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,840
Think it's something he does quite often

2148
01:57:56,096 --> 01:58:00,192
Is Poston stational unprovable Headlines by people that are meant to damage the reputation

2149
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,728
Consider his big

2150
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
What exam

2151
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:08,384
I figured if you wins the suit

2152
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,664
But you almost certainly will

2153
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
I even make it

2154
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,272
The courtroom

2155
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:17,088
Baby talk

2156
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,624
Literally anyone he's written

2157
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,720
Really chilling

2158
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:25,536
He went to his own abilities

2159
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:29,888
Know the person dupid idea the person who would be most damaged by him winning this lawsuit

2160
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,912
Somehow

2161
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,680
Ulta

2162
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,240
It's my feelings

2163
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,264
Attempted of publicity

2164
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,336
Hopefully

2165
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:39,360
Infowars

2166
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,640
Because the suits are

2167
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:44,224
Corridor Hill withdrawal them

2168
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,760
I don't think this is going any

2169
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:48,064
Further it really feels like this

2170
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:51,136
The temperature portray Alex's figure

2171
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,928
Something related to Sandy Hook

2172
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:56,256
In order to sway public opinion before his actual trial begin

2173
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,024
On that

2174
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:02,400
I recommend actual media Outlet leave this thing alone and let it play out its course

2175
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:03,680
As much as it might

2176
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:04,960
Feel really fun

2177
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:07,264
Two dog pile and jump in and make fun of

2178
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:08,800
I do think

2179
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:10,080
But that's his goal

2180
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,128
Let's all

2181
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,408
Just let him go to the

2182
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:17,248
We don't need a dragon

2183
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,296
It would seem

2184
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,112
So I get to talk about bar

2185
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:25,184
He does think it is

2186
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,464
Their secondary to the

2187
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:36,448
Two barns about that fighting video that Alex has from the

2188
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:37,216
Actually say it is

2189
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,240
Really yeah

2190
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:41,312
Cfrvideos

2191
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,320
The prosecutor

2192
01:59:57,184 --> 02:00:02,816
GoPro

2193
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:05,888
Noah

2194
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,424
It's very easy to overcome

2195
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,216
But notice the language

2196
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:14,592
He described as a prosecutor who was quote involved potentially

2197
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:16,384
In investigating Biden son

2198
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:19,200
Even Barnes knows that there was no investigation

2199
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,504
Dividing something to curtail

2200
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,808
But the Optics are so important

2201
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:27,648
Here you got to present the idea that there was it could have been babe

2202
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:33,024
And sincerely when this is all said and done I hope Barnes ends up disbarred

2203
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,840
His behavior on Infowars over the past couple months

2204
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:36,864
It's been a complete

2205
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,888
Disgrace to his profession

2206
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:42,240
He is not operating ethically in any sense

2207
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,800
It does kind of seem like you

2208
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:50,432
Evil DLC

2209
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:52,480
So yeah

2210
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:55,040
I would like to know the timeline

2211
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:55,808
Just f***

2212
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
Flipped

2213
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:59,392
Probably after defending

2214
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:05,024
Yeah maybe I don't know go on the show immediately

2215
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,304
After

2216
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,328
Starting to work on

2217
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,376
Friday quotes

2218
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:15,776
Is pretty close as anyone you know

2219
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,312
Just on the

2220
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:19,872
I think he was part of that

2221
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,408
To that Griff

2222
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,944
It wasn't it wasn't

2223
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:23,712
Too far off

2224
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,248
From when he started defend

2225
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:35,232
He's always seemed to

2226
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,560
You know he wants the spotlight

2227
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,120
To live out this

2228
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:41,888
Reality TV

2229
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:46,240
He got some attention and then all the sudden

2230
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,008
Sunny got a dick

2231
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:47,776
Get to the attention

2232
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:48,800
And now he's

2233
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:49,824
Loves 80s

2234
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,128
Great broadcaster

2235
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:55,968
Infowars

2236
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:56,992
Making

2237
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,552
Five grand for an appearance at a bar on a

2238
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:02,624
Friday night what's going to happen which is why

2239
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,952
The setup this evil at TLC

2240
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,976
You got a

2241
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:11,328
That's true.

2242
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,096
Which makes

2243
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:13,120
Next clip even more

2244
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:19,264
My family

2245
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,736
Course

2246
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:34,624
So you can talk about anything

2247
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:40,768
Let's look at all of your old cats Alex

2248
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,536
Category

2249
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:42,816
So sad

2250
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:44,352
You never knows until

2251
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,912
Travel

2252
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:48,448
That is trouble if you still believe

2253
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,592
You've noticed

2254
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:56,128
Left pechenik

2255
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:57,408
Your show

2256
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:59,968
Which suggests that you also do

2257
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:07,136
Music Carpe donktum on bragging about talking to a guy dresses up as a wall

2258
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:15,328
A real heroic endeavor

2259
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:21,728
Listen to this phone

2260
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:23,008
Between Alex and barn

2261
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:25,056
I really think it's

2262
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:27,616
As time goes on it becomes so much

2263
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,896
Weworewhat their relationship

2264
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,712
We don't

2265
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:35,296
As for Everybody's Free Speech

2266
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,352
Jetcost

2267
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:03,968
At the level we're at right now

2268
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:12,416
Dot-com

2269
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,208
A member

2270
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:18,048
I have a strong suspicion

2271
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,328
Pure advertising

2272
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:25,728
I have a strong suspicion that Barn for free

2273
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,776
Regal pro bono work

2274
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:34,176
Alex is promoting the free America

2275
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:39,296
Or whatever

2276
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,832
QuikTrip

2277
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:47,232
I think it's pretty clear for statement has been made in the pattern that we're seeing

2278
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:53,888
You know baby Barnes had ideas to get this off the ground and knew that Alex has a big media Empire with tons of listeners

2279
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:54,912
Is a great place

2280
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:55,680
To try and

2281
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:56,704
Cultivate

2282
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:58,752
Support for it

2283
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:05,152
Enough money

2284
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,688
Defending Wesley Snipes

2285
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:11,040
But I don't need money now or whatever I can take a hit work for Alex

2286
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:11,808
Free Takis

2287
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:13,344
High-profile Escape

2288
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,696
Play it don't believe that for a second

2289
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:23,072
But you work at a reduced rate in order to make yourself the only option Alex has

2290
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:27,424
Use them to f****** evil splc off the ground

2291
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,960
Halex great

2292
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:30,752
Don't know who you are

2293
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:35,360
Prince know and he's onboard

2294
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:38,176
I'm evil splc helps Alex to

2295
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,200
That all

2296
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:42,784
It kind of works in both of their favors but it's pretty clear with the arrangement

2297
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:44,576
Used to be yeah but one of them

2298
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,600
Is it going to lose

2299
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,624
They're both

2300
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,440
By losing Barnes

2301
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:50,976
Alex Just Lose It

2302
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:53,792
That's debatable

2303
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,072
Yeah I don't know

2304
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:59,424
Either

2305
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,216
Sure

2306
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:03,776
So there's big news in Alex's

2307
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,824
Also talked about for a second

2308
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,408
Connecticut Supreme Court was hearing the arguments

2309
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,432
About

2310
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,456
His

2311
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,528
He appealed the

2312
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:20,672
The punishment that he got for going on are drunk and trying to intimidate

2313
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:24,000
Supreme Court agreed to hear that

2314
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:26,048
Small section ride

2315
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,584
And here's Alex presents

2316
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:41,152
You know the judge was a

2317
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:49,088
Barn should not allow Alex to say things like that representation

2318
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:52,672
Supreme court hasn't taken over his Sandy Hook

2319
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:53,952
It's a small

2320
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:58,304
It was described in Connecticut paper that I was reading as a sideshow

2321
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:02,656
Of the actual case is a small matter about the sanction

2322
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,704
That was imposed because of his

2323
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,752
Million-dollar bounty

2324
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:18,016
We started recording this I don't know how that worked out

2325
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,808
Was being hurt

2326
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:22,368
I've got no thanks

2327
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,256
Relieved I don't know but whatever it is it has no real bearing on his actual case

2328
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,024
No and

2329
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,560
Either way

2330
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:31,328
He does get this

2331
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,400
The next day he'll say so

2332
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:35,680
Worthy of

2333
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:37,216
Undoubtedly

2334
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:47,968
Imply that Alex can do stuff like that on air if you want and the punishments won't come

2335
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:49,248
None and I guess

2336
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:52,832
I don't know

2337
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:57,440
Talking about how crazy

2338
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,976
Into the quarter Democrats

2339
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,768
If you really listen to

2340
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:01,792
Listen carefully

2341
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:03,840
It sounds like a perfect description

2342
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:04,608
In about

2343
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:08,448
Of the Democrats because they're so crazy

2344
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,528
Set the deepest

2345
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:31,232
Are you f****** with me all the time in various different permutation

2346
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,768
I'm just describing

2347
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:35,072
The other side doing exactly what they're doing

2348
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:39,936
Even down to staying at the other side is saying they're doing with the other side to do it

2349
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:40,704
Think it's just

2350
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,264
Intended to confuse

2351
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,032
People

2352
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:47,872
Yeah but that perfectly describes how my view of Alex

2353
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:49,920
Is from looking at his show

2354
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,992
Backed into a corner scared of

2355
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:55,552
The world's being what's actually going on

2356
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:58,112
It is operation

2357
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,136
Sad

2358
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,976
The cover for the bike

2359
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:07,072
Stop or there cover for the Trump staff

2360
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:08,864
But you see the exact same behavior

2361
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,632
Like it's all just a

2362
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,400
Dumb Shell gas

2363
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:11,936
You know

2364
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,240
Could

2365
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:15,776
Absolutely

2366
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,056
Insult

2367
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:17,824
Alex

2368
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,360
Friend

2369
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,152
If you just started it with

2370
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,688
I know this globalist

2371
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,760
Went on a laundry list of

2372
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:33,184
You started Radio Show in completely lost

2373
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
I agree

2374
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,304
So

2375
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:42,144
I come to the end of all this

2376
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:42,912
Is

2377
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:46,496
A sense of like there's a lot of really big ship going on

2378
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:52,896
In the real world

2379
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:55,200
Interesting angle

2380
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,224
And you really don't

2381
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:59,552
You're really died altimate leaves very disappointing list

2382
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:00,576
These episodes

2383
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,648
Makes me think

2384
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:08,256
Quite frankly he's not drinking because his response to this

2385
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:10,304
Kind of high-level s***

2386
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,352
Even six months ago would have been

2387
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:15,424
If you look at the show and it's just

2388
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:18,752
Yelling about Biden Greta thunberg Hitler

2389
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:21,568
Uninspired in Alderwood

2390
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,616
Absolutely have been in a

2391
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,384
Emergency

2392
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:25,920
Report

2393
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:32,320
I couldn't find one I don't know if he's allowed to do those

2394
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,344
Because of this

2395
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,136
Unresolved

2396
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:38,464
I don't I don't know I don't know what it is I feel

2397
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:40,512
Disappointed

2398
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:41,280
In some ways

2399
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:43,328
Interesting

2400
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:45,632
I think it's interesting to learn about the

2401
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,912
You know the angle

2402
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:49,472
Being attacked on sunburn

2403
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:52,800
Soros

2404
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,080
Qanon Twitter account

2405
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,360
That's interesting

2406
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:57,152
It's interesting too

2407
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:59,200
See the reality of the bike

2408
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:00,736
Stuff in Ukraine

2409
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:03,808
Alex can do better

2410
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:05,344
Or we could do better

2411
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,112
It's something

2412
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,904
Realistic be more into

2413
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:10,976
Disappoint

2414
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:15,072
Expect better propaganda

2415
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,608
You are not that any

2416
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,656
I really I really

2417
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:20,448
In his life

2418
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:23,008
That clip of him

2419
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,032
Just

2420
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,056
Telling everybody

2421
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:27,360
Right

2422
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,152
He is going

2423
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:30,176
Dude I look

2424
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:32,992
Man in the Heights

2425
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,016
Hightower in the Heights

2426
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:35,040
Moment of life

2427
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:36,576
There were two pads

2428
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:40,928
I could have gone here and then there's this reality and I went

2429
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:41,696
This way and I got

2430
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:43,488
Sure that's what the

2431
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,352
Castle is about

2432
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,120
Fair enough

2433
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:52,192
Just like you misuse and Philip K Dick's

2434
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:52,960
Fight

2435
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:56,032
Even if this is kind of uninspired and weak

2436
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:59,360
Propaganda that could just easily be done by anybody else

2437
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:01,152
It's still worth it

2438
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:01,920
To go over there

2439
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:02,944
For the revelation

2440
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:03,712
Alex

2441
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,760
The Jefferson Davis was the u.s. president

2442
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:08,320
Tank that will live on as

2443
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,880
Probably the most on Branch Road

2444
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,440
Yeah I can't think

2445
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:18,304
On Monday with a new episode

2446
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:21,120
It's been a long time since we did a Wacky Wednesday up

2447
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,912
Might do on a Monday

2448
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,192
Palate cleanser

2449
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:27,008
Wilton

2450
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:30,592
That is a good point things are moving fast

2451
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:36,224
I honestly think we have finished recording it

2452
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:40,832
But we'll see.

2453
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:41,856

2459

Could leave a review Butler

2466
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:07,200
The best way to hear this

2467
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:08,480
Is go down

2468
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:09,760
To your local

2469
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,344
I don't know which one is yours

2470
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:15,648
Specifically is off Highway

2471
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,464
Okay

2472
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,256
A real salty cup of coffee

2473
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:24,096
Terrible Diner terrible you that you had that

2474
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:27,680
I'm not sure I have

2475

And

2476
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:30,496
When the woman brings out your

2477
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,264
Your check cuz it's

2478
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,848
She's going to bring out that Notepad

2479
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,384
You going to have it in her little late

2480
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,688
Underneath it

2481
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:40,736
Poems like a magician

2482

Thumb drive
