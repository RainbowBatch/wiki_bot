1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge like I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Knowledge

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

6
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Nike.com

7
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,208
Everybody welcome back to knowledge play damn damn

8
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
I'm sure

9
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,632
Like to drink novelty beverages in their own homes then sit around and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

10
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
It does appear that that is our plan for the the time being right now Dan Jordan we are we recording

11
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
This separately probably the first

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
Actual episode that we recorded over

13
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,968
Distance it's a little bit weird

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,088
Removable remains to be seen. It's an actual episode

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
Jedi with the in

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
Intention of

17
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,256
Of a regular episode kind of kind of a mini episode

18
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,912
I don't want to again just don't want to stress to everybody that we not going to have episodes every Monday when

19
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Wednesday and Friday

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
But

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
Circumstances kind of demanded

22
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
This weekend we had to

23
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,384
We had to jump on the horse and get something

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Get something together

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Yeah I don't

26
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
I think that's a terrible idea

27
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
But simultaneously

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
We can't get together

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
Does Chicago has waist-deep snow out

30
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
It's bad

31
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Really bad

32
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
And I ran out of coffee I ran out of coffee last night

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Yaz morning

34
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
I was about to take

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
Take the dogs out for a walk and I always start

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Cup of coffee

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Coffee

38
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
A pot of coffee

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,336
Before I take the dogs out and I realized in that moment I have none

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,456
So I had to walk through close to a mile

41
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Waist-deep snow

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Coffee

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Is the most brutal morning I've ever had

44
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
I walk down to the grocery store

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
Cuz I had needed some some salad

46
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Stuff for lunch

47
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
And it was a

48
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
The Dead Zone

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
There's nobody there it was

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
It was fantastic

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Yeah

52
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
It was

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
I mean

54
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Despite

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,824
Logistical problems that everyone's dealing with

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
There was no one at a grocery store was pretty nice

57
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
There are some advantages

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,600
So I guess my bright spot is that till you and I are both doing relatively alright

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
It was coming down

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,208
All day all night yesterday

61
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Disaster

62
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,376
Last night was it was one of the first times I've seen that kind of snow storm and I was like

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
Man I think I'm actually scared for sure

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Argo

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,288
Like we did look we get covered in snow.

66
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,128
That's fine one was like oh s*** this one might be too much

67
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
For us

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,712
Yeah yeah whatever people start talking and feet

69
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
It's like

70
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,344
You didn't say 16in you said multiple

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
That's trouble

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
That's the reason that we needed to jump on the old Zoom here and get an episode together was because

73
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
Alex is also dealing with inclement weather

74
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
Usually

75
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
You got some you know. Texas is seeing

76
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
Unprecedented

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
Winter storm

78
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
They're happening right now

79
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616

80
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
Spin instructor

Bye

82
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
By the the dice

83
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
The Winter Queen

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,576
What's the name of the character in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe

85
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
Cuz I think it's just

86
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Well anyway Alex wants some Turkish delight

87
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Okay

88
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Alright okay

89
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Running out of breath

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
Will stop playing all of the

91
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
Voyage of the Dawn Treader

92
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Boy and his horse

93
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Sorry

94
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
Yeah Silverchair Prince Caspian

95
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Lion Witch and the Wardrobe

96
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Right

97
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,967
Did they say why to the Dawn Treader I think I said that first

98
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
You're two of them

99
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
You're missing the final two

100
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
The Magician's Apprentice

101
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Call close

102
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Sorcerer's Apprentice

103
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,743
Not only real close the Magician's Nephew

104
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Yes

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
There you go

106
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
I think I

107
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
I forgot

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
I think it's just the last battle

109
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Oh that's probably a pet very boring

110
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Everything really boring book

111
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
Can't believe I forgot them

112
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
The Magician's Nephew

113
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
A book

114
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,735
You know what I think that one's always been my favorite

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
I was like that one the little rings

116
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,879
Did they go into the little middle of the world to teleport thing

117
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
Always fun

118
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
I read the hell out of those

119
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
And I don't think I remember the

120
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Plot of

121
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Any of the at least the last

122
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Four of them

123
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
Oh no that's fine

124
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
Totally fine

125
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
The prequel

126
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
No and that's why I've always liked it it's

127
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
The prequel to The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe

128
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Okay so it's like the Tokyo Drift

129
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Before the main characters die

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Picture

131
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
So Jordan

132
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,439
We got tell you know some Alex Jones stupidity to deal with it'll be a little bit of a briefer episode but

133
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54,559
What's I wanted to check in with how he's doing in occupied by Ice OST

Rocksmith I was I saw it

147
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
I saw that joke coming

148
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
Try to duck

149
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
And you still hit me in the face with it

150
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
That's out

151
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Wild sorry I have

152
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Cookies on the map

153
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,935
Yeah and I think we've got one more little piece of

154
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
I think we've got one more little Visa but we're getting into this place if we're just shouting people out for

155
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
No reason at this point

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,199
Unreason over this particular Shout

157
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
One particular reason and that is it is their anniversary today

158
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Play I Believe

159
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Bonnie and Eric

160
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Happy

161
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
20th wedding anniversary

162
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
For Wednesday the 17th

163
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
20 years dance exciting

164
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Anniversary right

165
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
The 20th of the piano

166
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,823
Yeah yeah first is paper second is like silver no way that's my

167
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Much later

168
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
20th and Vienna Rose

169
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,367
I hope you guys exchange pianos and that would be the right way to do it

170
00:07:54,623 --> 00:08:00,767
Yeah that's is traditionally back to my hosting stand-up comedy days I like I like to do

171
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,327
You know you start out ever showed Zanies with a

172
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Anybody celebrating anything tonight

173
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
The difference here is that people have

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,751
Told us that they're celebrating something as opposed to us starting the show having to fish

175
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
4 something

176
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,359
To love are different

177
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
It's

178
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
It's more celebratory less sad

179
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
Jordan 16th

180
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,695

181
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Vignette

00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Of himself

183
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
At the Emporia Studio

184
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,143
Lights are out in the studio there's also

185
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
A couple of them where he's outside yelling in the snow

186
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
What does this make sense though

187
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
It's all nonsense and we can talk about it

188
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Today Show

189
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Don't be scared yellow

190
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
Hello dogs Novi property rights

191
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Wow that's

192
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
The plan that's

193
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
They are very interested in borders

194
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
They don't like immigration

195
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,631
From house to house that's the the situation that dogs are Libertarians

196
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
They are part of the Austrian School

197
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
I feel like this is just Alex like

198
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Protecting other people

199
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
From his mist

200
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,175
You know he's hurt so many dogs because he was afraid of them right

201
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,015
And now he's sharing his wisdom with the rest of the world hey guys

202
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
Just throw a rock at a dog murderer

203
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
Just throw Rockets dog that's fine I forgot

204
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Yeah yeah

205
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Don't shoot too hard

206
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:40,095
Lil'jordan we're here recording on Tuesday and that's what time is episode being put together Infowars has essentially been off a

207
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Are since Sunday evening

208
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Cancel culture

209
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Austin and most

210
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,799
Do Texas is dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime winter storm has left countless people without power

211
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
In severe

212
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
It appears that

213
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
Bn4 Studio has been left also

214
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Without power

215
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
And that means no show for Alex

216
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
It makes sense and I don't think anyone would bat an eye if you just got on air and said there's a weather emergency and they had to take an unplanned breaking

217
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Program it

218
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,071
He could be an effective way to push emergency food sales even so it might not end up being a total money loss if you did that

219
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
But Alex does not go that route

220
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Instead of

221
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Expressing solidarity with

222
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,799
The people of Texas is encouraging people to stay inside if possible and donating to a mutual Aid fun

223
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
Alex decided to record a video of himself at the Infowars studio with the lights off

224
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
Explaining how power outages are Act

225
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Actually a globalist

226
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Conspiracy really we

227
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
Had to get there hog scalar attack I would have scalar attack or what aliens if we're going to do

228
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
Globalist conspiracy

229
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
We'll get to the specifics of this but right off

230
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,095
The bad I wanted to explain why Alex feels the need to make this

231
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Conspiracy

232
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Instead of just being normal

233
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
Kind of thing you know you were human you accept it

234
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Inclement weather happens

235
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
But sometimes it gets in the way

236
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,431
I have I have a reason I've got a he might want this to be a conspiracy

237
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,807
I'm just going to go with Mage mainly one of the large contributors to this

238
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Disaster being so much worse

239
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Is his state

240
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,951
Actually being interested in following the policies that he himself

241
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Advocates

242
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,095
Number for off the list that was number four

243
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
The first reason is that Alex has a vested interest in infantilizing his audience

244
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,311
You need their critical thinking skills to be on a child's level so whenever he has the chance he

245
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
He creates childish narrative

246
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,223
When you're in bed and you hear a bump you can either think that it's the water heater or you could think it's a Viking

247
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Who's invaded your house to come and get you

248
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,367
Adults are really capable you know they're ready able to reason it out

249
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439
There's no reason of Viking would be in your home but for children

250
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,791
Reminds gravitate to the more exciting possibilities which is often nonsense

251
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,375
But it appeals to a particular emotional need in a drive

252
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
The children have

253
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
No ignition

254
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Are are we is it around like

255
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
860 ad in which case

256
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
It is a terrifying time travel is possible

257
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
So I'm traveling water heater

258
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,319
Noises the water heater doesn't prompt an irrational response in

259
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
A person

260
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,671
They can ignore it or if it's a serious noise they can choose to call the technician

261
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,023
If you can convince people though that it's actually a viking who almost got them

262
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
You might be able to sell them all sorts of product

263
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Vikings or even

264
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
Documentaries where you explain how Vikings operate and how to avoid their attacks lamp

265
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
Keeping the audience in a state where they don't deal with

266
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
The problems that the come up and

267
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
A boring but ultimately real way

268
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
And keeping them

269
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,247
Fixated on childish emotional interpretations of every step

270
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Stimulus they receive

271
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
Is essential for Alex's business model

272
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
So even a giant storm can't just be a storm

273
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
Clearly an attack on

274
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Conservatives

275
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Absolute

276
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,607
The second reason that Alex has a strong interest in presenting this storm is some kind of an act of Foul Play is that

277
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
It's really

278
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Something that just

279
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Happens in nature and if so

280
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
He should have been prepared

281
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
For it

282
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
New brand has largely built around being a prepper type of guy so the first question that comes up in the case of his Network being taken offline

283
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
Find by a storm is naturally why weren't you

284
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Prepared for that

285
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,879
Winter storm like this hitting Texas is obviously a very unlikely event

286
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
And something that the infrastructure was unprepared for

287
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
Play my heart goes out to everyone who's dealing

288
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
With the country

289
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
For Alex

290
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
The fact that he could be caught off-guard by a natural event

291
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,935
That's a contradiction of the way he wants the audience to see him

292
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
Then so obviously that's to be prepared for the literal end-of-the-world I would imagine that include some

293
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,639
Sort of the power grid going down

294
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Your rights

295
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,991
You touched on the 4th one which is the state of Texas

296
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
To somehow they operate will talk about that a little bit down the line

297
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,647
The third issue is that a storm like this brings into

298
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Some of the Elementals

299
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
The climate change conversation

300
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
But Alex doesn't want people to

301
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
Africa climate changes and weather events

302
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Become more severe

303
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
They're going to TASC long-standing assumptions

304
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Interest

305
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Structure and how we built

306
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Princeton

307
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
Houses are designed differently in different parts of the country

308
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
Like in California they prioritize Earth

309
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Quake

310
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Protection

311
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
Where I am

312
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
In Blake in Missouri where I grew up

313
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
Every single family home that you're going to find

314
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Has a basement

315
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Because of tornadoes

316
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Right

317
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
Do you know basement or less prevalent in flood

318
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Pro region

319
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,863
Florida is not known for having tons of basements that are literally underneath the

320
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Yeah it as

321
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
So do you know

322
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,031
Different sorts of weather patterns and more severe storms hit different areas

323
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
You're going to see

324
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Those things

325
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,663
Did the long-standing assumptions that we've had

326
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
Not be enough

327
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
To suffice

328
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
And Alex doesn't want the audience

329
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
About

330
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Because it requires

331
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,159
Shipping ideas and paradigms and he's not it

332
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Horse

333
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
I have plan

334
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Here's my

335
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
Okay because as shifting weather patterns are going to test our assumptions and our architecture

336
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
What if

337
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Now and hear me out

338
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
We got a lot of Real Estate

339
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,103
Now admittedly it is being held right now

340
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
But if you go underneath the

341
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
Get all right

342
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
No problems with weather issues problems with you know all that stuff

343
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
Dorm dare you knock out a few Nazis and then you got a home for life then there is essentially a city under

344
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
The Getty Museum if we are

345
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
To believe the people we've hurt

346
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Problem

347
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Face down there

348
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Yeah

349
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
It's so

350
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
You know these are the kind of things that are essential for Alex to have his audience not

351
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Wait this is a natural storm

352
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
This is this is bad but

353
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
You know you should

354
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
No middle

355
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Was a possibility

356
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,735
You are prepared for this you got caught on

357
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
On your back foot

358
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Weird

359
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
Maybe I shouldn't trust you about every

360
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
Instead of a conspiracy maybe go like milk

361
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Conspiracy

362
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
Buy snow tires just in case

363
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:05,631
You know I kind of felt like that was the direction he was going to go on Sunday after obsessing about the like

364
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
The traffic

365
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,447
Yeah

366
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
But it turns out

367
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Turns out

368
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Did Alex

369
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Is in the great reset

370
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
And that is why

371
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,663
The power is out Aiden for Studio

372
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
Our power has been turned off 40% of the state without power this morning

373
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
All the great reset

374
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
I told my wife

375
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
That this morning

376
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,023
History guy walks american-statesman admitting

377
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Coal plants in Texas under Obama

378
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
The windmills in West Texas failed

379
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
Feel weaker longer

380
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Rolling blackout

381
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Because

382
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Cole is evil

383
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,735
And we have to open the windows up to have light

384
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
They're going to give you a chair real quick

385
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,159
So Alex wants to pretend that the wind turbines freezing in Texas is what caused the blackout

386
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
But that is absolutely not

387
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
True

388
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
German article in Bloomberg

389
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,631
Quote well are uses for some turbines to shut down as the brutal cold wave drives record electricity demand

390
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,983
That's been the least significant factor in the blackouts according to Dan Woodfin

391
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,567
A senior director for the electric reliability Council of Texas

392
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Which operates the states

393
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Powergrid

394
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
The main factors

395
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Frozen in

396
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,295
Instrument that natural gas coal and even nuclear facilities as well as limited supplies of natural gas

397
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
ESAT

398
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
The article goes out the hole is evil

399
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,207
The article goes on to quote Daniel Cohen

400
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,071
Associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University you said that it quote

401
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
Is really a red herring

402
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
To blame renewable energy production

403
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
And for the blackout

404
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,263
If the wind turbines were operating at full capacity thing

405
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Still be bad

406
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,335
Because the infrastructure of Texas power grid

407
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
And how was unprepared to deal with the weather event like

408
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
Alex doesn't want to address that

409
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Point because it's real

410
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
And it requires calling in a technician

411
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,599
You would rather blame imaginary Viking

412
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Yeah

413
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
Peoples of windmill

414
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,047
You have to pay for a technician you have to pay for maintaining your power grid

415
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
You have to pay for all of this stuff

416
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,423
But if it's the imaginary globalist somehow they're paying Alex

417
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
It makes perfect sense

418
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Going to do it

419
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
So Alex doesn't

420
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,103
Quite understand the conversation that a lot of people are having surrounding

421
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Climate issues

422
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
We've heard this kind of position be expressed

423
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
On when he was on Rogan

424
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Gunshow

425
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
This idea is that like

426
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
Everybody wants like

427
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
There to be no carbon

428
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Shore shore shore shore

429
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
It's very strange

430
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Here we are

431
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
In the world

432
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,679
Carbon dioxide water vapor

433
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
Not even close

434
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Texas

435
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
And they admit

436
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
The whole

437
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
This is green energy

438
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
But it's worth

439
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
This is the new Dark Age

440
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Let's not

441
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
See that in the Austin american-statesman article

442
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,047
Just doesn't understand the issues of like

443
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
Excess carbon

444
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
Not like that there will be no carbon

445
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Dockside in the world

446
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
I don't think that that to anyone

447
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
The Advocate

448
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,615
No it's a it's this is a this is a child going

449
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Okay what

450
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,991
So I eat 35 apples a day you want nobody to have any apples

451
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
0 apples then huh

452
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
So you're saying I should have a moderate about

453
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Q

454
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,463
Yeah take apples away from the honest working man

455
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,279
I don't know why that's a six-year-old kid but

456
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,351
It's creating a false argument

457
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
Yeah it's stupid

458
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,239
And that's because Alex is able to do that because he's a climate scientist

459
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Just basically

460
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
It was a lot hotter in Alaska

461
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,927
Open tiny bit

462
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,255
Thank God that's us terraforming and a good wife

463
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Wow

464
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
He knows a lot

465
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
He's he's very very insightful on these things

466
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Yeah

467
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Yeah that's not good

468
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
No

469
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
Also oxygen is

470
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Specifically not

471
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Gas

472
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
No it's

473
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
The chase guess there's only like what

474
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
Percent of oxygen in the atmosphere nothing

475
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
And saying that CO2 is a trace gases meaningless

476
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
What's in this contact

477
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,623
Goodbye because the message you seem to suggested that there's so little of it that we should just make more

478
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
That's dumb

479
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
Ammonia is also a Trace

480
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
But I think that Alex would realize you don't want a ton of it in the

481
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
The air

482
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
Because of obvious

483
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Obvious reason

484
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:57,471
All right you're making a good point but have you ever walked near a volcano and just breathed in

485
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Pure sulfur dioxide

486
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,127
Get your breathing real good you know that's what you want that

487
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:08,223
Gas we should limit the amount of sulfur dioxide

488
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Don't you want to chew your air

489
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
So good that we raise the temp

490
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
So good

491
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:25,120
Terrible at this point if you're a climate denier it has to be like

492
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
I think I can wait out the clock

493
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Rain

494
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:33,056
You don't like there's no way Alex isn't is it like at a certain point like

495
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
Oh s*** the climate really is f*****

496
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
I can't ignore this anymore

497
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:42,784
But I'll probably be off the air by the time people would have really hold me accountable for it

498
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,416
You know it could be I mean there has to be a certain amount of I'm not going to have to pay the Fiddler

499
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
NFL

500
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
There's another part

501
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
With Alex though I really do think that he is

502
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Is just like

503
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Dumb

504
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,912
He is just not interested in someone has explained it to him in such a way that like

505
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
Play the totally clean

506
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
And he's never seen fit to have to look into it

507
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Cuz why

508
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Yeah

509
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
I just don't know

510
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
How stupid do you have to delete be

511
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,528
To just believe that unlike a gullibility scale

512
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,600
I wouldn't trust a coal plant if I walked

513
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
Like the people who run cold

514
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,512
Demonstrable be evil and have been for 150 years

515
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
Insulting to politically aligned with the

516
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
The sort of things that Alex is into

517
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
You know generally higher

518
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
Yeezys he's inclined to

519
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,056
Even though

520
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
He does

521
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,896
F****** Darth Vader Impressions all the time

522
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:47,552
The dark side is the good people

523
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,952
So Alex is inside in the hallway at this point in the video and then he eating out Elder

524
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
We can go outside

525
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
I put go outside

526
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
Okay outside and show you

527
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,144
Bill Gates 12-quart block out the Sun and look where we're at

528
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
Freezing our asses off

529
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,640
21st century

530
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
He is not established

531
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
You did not demonstrate this in any way

532
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
No

533
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
When Matt Barnes

534
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Real cool

535
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
Cool

536
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
Destroyed by Obama see it

537
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
The great reset

538
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,536
Or you could say those things but it doesn't mean it

539
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
No connection

540
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,424
Reality really Obama

541
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,520
The great resets fault Dan do you understand

542
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Yeah

543
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Sure

544
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
So Alex goes outside

545
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
And these just

546
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
The man yelling in the snow

547
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
He is hanging out

548
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
The snow backdrop

549
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Being mad

550
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
I think this is really in

551
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Interstate because

552
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,488
If you take him at his word he seems to be lamenting the Industrial Revolution

553
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
And how

554
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,888
How it made it so we don't have to make our own power or something that made us suck

555
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,216
Piety

556
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,056
Domesticated on the system

557
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Are they pulling the gas station in a

558
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,808
Or they go to the grocery store today

559
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,392
Fresh food

560
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
Away from Atlanta

561
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
But at least I know that

562
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
I don't understand what he's

563
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Complaining about

564
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
You're So Soft cuz we

565
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Back there to be power when we

566
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,616
You know I've all agreed to collectively pay for a power come

567
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Yeah yeah yeah

568
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
1

569
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,064
Hello Unabomber it's been awhile since we shared

570
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
2

571
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
No

572
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
I think it's far worse

573
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,560
Look if you if you and I want to say we're unaware that the technology has

574
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Domesticated Us in weave

575
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
Moved away from the land

576
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
And then act like that that's fine but if we are aware of it and don't take steps to avoid it and instead only tell

577
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
Other people to do it

578
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
What are the critical pieces of s*** you recently listened to

579
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,992
Oh yeah absolutely his is pretending that like at least I know

580
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Is yeah it does make it way worse

581
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
Yeah you should you should be

582
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
Putting out

583
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Little tiny videos

584
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
Should be

585
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Underground somewhere maybe

586
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
You want to join the land

587
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
Yeah if you want to broadcast

588
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
You should not ever

589
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:49,568
Have inclement weather getting away because you should have a ton of generators can you should be broadcasting from

590
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Compound somewhere that no one knows where it is

591
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,456
You got a bunch of potatoes growing so you don't have to worry about anybody

592
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,064
Hello Unabomber it's been a long time since we've

593
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
It is strange

594
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Hello there it is it's a really interesting thing

595
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Alex is like Okay so

596
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
Are uplinks are in another state

597
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,792
So they still have powers and what we have

598
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,352
To do we have to shoot these little videos

599
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
And then send them over somewhere else

600
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Men

601
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,032
You got an elaborate system to get like little tiny videos

602
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Kind of

603
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Yeah that's great

604
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Yeah it's

605
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
It seems like you should just not do this

606
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
Take the day off

607
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,392
That's my feeling about it and the argument that he's making is so not come

608
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
Compelling that I don't even know why

609
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Will you bother

610
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
Why try to make

611
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Conspiracy

612
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Stay-home

613
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
Yeah you don't need to risk

614
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Yeah

615
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,984
Yeah but on the other hand he couldn't risk

616
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,800
Other people's lives and still probably make it to work

617
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200
Which is maybe his favorite thing to do Dasher and I mean there's employees there to talk he's alone at the studio to so

618
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,784
Even better his wife is still playing tennis

619
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Probably

620
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Yeah

621
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,184
So Alex I think the reason he's doing this is cuz he wants to go out

622
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,720
Really saw this coming

623
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
He knew what was going to happen

624
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,816
Written about every

625
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
How do you think I can make a film

626
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Blueprint for Global enslavement

627
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
And you watch the damn film almost all of his come true

628
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,152
Because almost

629
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,016
You deserve to have this done to you

630
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:44,000
They all have private jets we all got a bunch of kid they all have palatial Mansions they all live however they want

631
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Yu-Gi-Oh

632
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
They're telling you

633
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:57,312
That's a lot of snow pulled out of his little brain

634
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
But like

635
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
This is nonsense

636
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,712
I'm starting to get feelings almost like Stolen Valor

637
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:10,112
On his bike his part of like being right about things yeah yeah

638
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,208
I resent that he's just pointing to endgame being like I was right about everything

639
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,256
You should go to re-watch your own work

640
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
This is not good

641
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Here's the worst part

642
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Okay

643
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Endgame

644
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
Was it say a large amount about a road

645
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Chat

646
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Had it been built

647
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,104
Would probably of ameliorated a lot of problems they are currently experiencing

648
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
So Not only was he not right about that

649
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
It should have been built so he didn't have to deal with it today

650
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,040
I'm not positive that the road would have helped as much as you think

651
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
But it was a really big Road.

652
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Pretty bag

653
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:48,000
And also Alex's does need to do this show not only to gloat about how he was right

654
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
So he wasn't

655
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,120
He also needs to make an announcement there are new numbers out

656
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
The new number

657
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
Do you want you know these numbers are

658
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Quicken

659
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Is working a new number

660
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
It's not.

661
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
It's not brand new numb

662
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
You misunderstood

663
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
Okay I'm not discovered a new number

664
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,016
I was just checking to see if maybe they discovered any number

665
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
I recognize that's a fair interpretation of what I said

666
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
To the globalist

667
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,328
Yeah long time they had claims of how many people they were going

668
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Nikhil

669
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
Sure.

670
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
There's new number

671
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
Pretending like you're part of the establishment be going along with this

672
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,456
Over to get rid of half the world's population of 70

673
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
The good people she'll be around the Earth

674
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,416
What percent of world population

675
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,816
Call Teresa cell isolate

676
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:06,080
A culling program

677
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
They decided to

678
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Dynamite

679
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,064
IQ ball

680
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
What's happening to you

681
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,952
What happened to you as it happened in real life

682
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Scumbag

683
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
Chick-fil-A

684
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
Michelle

685
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
Lifestyle

686
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,800
Poster children commit suicide

687
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
Ruthless

688
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,688
Dominate control others and if you lay down to them

689
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,624
And that's why we need to primary week Republicans

690
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,184
I'm confused is this not okay

691
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
All right take back the house

692
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
This is so exciting

693
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,120
It's just nausea

694
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
Beautiful Soul Justin

695
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:07,008
Idiot standing in the snow yelling for no reason

696
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,640
It's kind of a preview of what his life is going to be like in 10 years the visual of it is really jarring

697
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,456
Because it is like I mean it's Alex Jones so like he's

698
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
You know this

699
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
It's notable Firebrand

700
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Idiot

701
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
A complete imp

702
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Videos showing

703
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Because he's

704
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Standing in the snow

705
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Yelling about his animated

706
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,328
No he's leaving Nicholas preacher

707
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
Yeah but

708
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
How little

709
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,984
Importer meaning is there to him being like there's a new numbers

710
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,056
But ninety-nine percent of the population going to be killed

711
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Okay now you can't

712
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,432
Make it smaller or they could be survivors number smaller

713
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,528
Like you have just backed yourself into a corner where it's like okay now

714
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,904
You're just making up numbers and now you've gotten to the end of the line

715
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
There's no more numbers

716
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,792
I like the idea that there are quarterly extermination reports

717
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,912
Every quarter there's new numbers like we were going to kill 99%

718
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
At the end of the first quarter but now rebooking things into the second quarter projecting a 97 Ford

719
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Recent murder

720
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
Some weirdo like Daniel estulin

721
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,736
Call zalika Bilderberg they were saying it's 99 now

722
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
There was a faction

723
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
They were saying 98

724
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
But they lost to the end

725
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Wealthfront

726
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
Call fell apart

727
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
Not to not to spend too much time

728
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,936
Talkin about why he's standing in the snow

729
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Alex decides

730
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
BL about the vaccine

731
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
There is hope

732
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
That's why I said

733
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Marquette

734
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Get over it

735
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
Huge move that van they got scared

736
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,888
Australia vaccine that they put on a Chevy

737
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Hy-Vee store

738
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Yeah right

739
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,664
Most of that s*** we've covered in the past and episodes that's all nonsense

740
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
The India one that was a new narrative so I wanted to just

741
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
Clarify why India didn't approve the use of Pfizer

742
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
There's covid-19 back

743
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Maxine

744
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
Is reported by CNBC back

745
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
February 5th

746
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,768
The Advisory withdrawn their application for emergency use of their vaccine in India after

747
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Quote

748
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
The government in January approved

749
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
Too much cheaper shots

750
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,752
There were a couple of other hurdles namely that India requires local studies to be done to approve vaccine you

751
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
And studies advisors vaccine that had not been done

752
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
India

753
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,408
The second issue is that Maxine the one that they've created

754
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Divisor one

755
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
It requires that words in very cold condition

756
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Concern

757
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,344
About the ability for it to be rolled out all over India

758
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
Yeah there's there's

759
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Concerned about the

760
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
Supply of deep freeze

761
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
Capabilities

762
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Weather

763
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
I was just pretending they banded Peak

764
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
When in reality

765
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
Really just kind of a boring lives

766
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
6 issue

767
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Again

768
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,288
This is a water heater noise Alex is trying to tell you is a Viking

769
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,456
Yeah that's it that's like crazy India they like listen guys we're going to have to ban the import of snowballs

770
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:33,344
Now I know they don't get far once they get across the border but we just can't let this happen anymore

771
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,232
Cheaper options that will do the same thing that a snowball doesn't

772
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,328
So Alex still

773
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
Being dumb

774
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Starts talking about how

775
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
Texas Eustis

776
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,288
Supply everyone with power

777
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,688
In the summer in the winter

778
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
Credible job that we've been shut

779
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
That's a complete lie

780
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:10,464
Texas is it unique state in the country in terms of their power grid and it's actually one of the reasons

781
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,768
That the situation in the state now is so much

782
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
More complicated

783
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,608
Texas is the only state in the country that has its own

784
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
Completely autonomous power grid called

785
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
Which is run by the electric reliability Council of techs

786
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,568
Houston Public Media recently posted a very concise

787
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,104
Explanation of how the system works

788
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
And how it got the

789
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
Maybe the way it is which I will paraphrase

790
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
It doesn't and they f***** it up

791
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,112
When electricity started to become more prevalent the country saw utility companies begin to

792
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Combine and link up

793
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,184
Regional

794
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Things

795
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:46,048
In 1935f Dr sign the federal power Act

796
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,656
Quotes which charge the federal power commission with overseeing Interstate Ali

797
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Electricity sale

798
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,776
The federal government could only really get involved with regulating interstate

799
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Power exchanges

800
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
So in order to avoid that regulation

801
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,944
Texas has remained the only state in the country with its own power grid

802
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,088
This has been breached a few times notably a1976 when a Texas power company said power 20K

803
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
Oklahoma very briefly

804
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
And what's been called the quotient midnight

805
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Connection

806
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Alex is completely making up

807
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
But the state of Texas

808
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
Is formally provided energy 250

809
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
18 states

810
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,656
I suspect that he doesn't even know that his dates energy setup

811
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:29,056
I is the way it is and how some of the problems he's complaining about all these direct byproduct of his State following his own anti-federal

812
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Government paranoia

813
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
It's kind of embarrassing

814
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
That he has no idea how it works

815
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
Because everybody else does

816
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
The differently it's

817
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
It's their fault

818
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
Together not knowing how he does

819
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
Yeah probably

820
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
You know

821
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
It's really it's really weird to me

822
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,096
Cuz like it should be a point of Pride to him

823
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
Babe the Texas dozen

824
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
Supply

825
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,728
Yeah to other states and other states

826
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Why power to them

827
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
It should be like this

828
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,944
Rugged individual pre-industrial Revolution

829
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:13,344
Instead of mine our own call we burn our own call at that always f****** do

830
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,208
He's still he's instead choosing to be more attractive narrative to him

831
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:23,072
Which is that Obama made it so Texas doesn't Supply most

832
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Of the country rap

833
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Electricity

834
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
Somehow it still

835
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
The a Obama pro-coal

836
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Kind of narratives

837
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
Take precedence over his

838
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
States rights

839
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Jacking off

840
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Like

841
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,712
I think that depends on the day 2

842
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Probably

843
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Yeah

844
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,064
I would I would also argue

845
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
In this circumstance

846
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,696
Alex is

847
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
I guess trap

848
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
You know like

849
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
Everything that he says is going to be wrong

850
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,168
Because the reality of it is like

851
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
This is all f***** up Beyond reason because

852
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
You know we made choices to

853
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Get this place

854
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,896
I think that Alex might be literally trapped

855
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
As well

856
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
His wife might be driving the Audi

857
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,040
So he might be stuck

858
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Studio

859
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,136
Like this well scream on the street I'm not going anywhere.

860
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
The five

861
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
Alex

862
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
Skip's to rambling

863
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,280
About some other stuff and I found this

864
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,352
Particular thought that he has a little bit

865
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
Upsetting this has to do with the storming of

866
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
The capital

867
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
Because the globalist

868
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Fear what you saw at the Capitol

869
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
It was a few hundred that got the big Master do it

870
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Globalist

871
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
Security standard

872
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
What they feared in

873
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
In the future

874
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Could be discredited now

875
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,296
A million people

876
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
Okay so

877
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
What I'm hearing is

878
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
The globalist

879
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
Afraid of what

880
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
And on the 6th

881
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
And so they did.

882
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,888
The 6th in order to make sure that Alex

883
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
Couldn't do it better later

884
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Yes

885
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
You are correct

886
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
What is exactly what happened

887
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Gray

888
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,384
Alex's Alex's point I believe is that

889
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,432
A few million people

890
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
Over-running the capital

891
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
That's a

892
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,624
W guys that means we win this one a few hundred people with

893
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Fox

894
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
So

895
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
Yeah I think he's really against

896
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,256
The principles of what happened at on the sick

897
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
I think I think it's at

898
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:35,936
I think it's become quite clear that now he realizes he's not going to get arrested or anything he can

899
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
Subtly

900
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Just chill out

901
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,128
You know hey guys guys two weeks from now anybody not busy two weeks

902
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,432
That's where we got to get a couple million

903
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
So

904
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,320
We know that Alex is a scholar on the

905
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Matter of

906
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
Carbon dioxide

907
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
July Matt James

908
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
WWII

909
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,048
Alex does he seems to think of this

910
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
Before and that's why I wanted to play this again

911
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Because it's such a dumbass thought

912
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
That

913
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,496
I'm surprised he repeats the

914
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,312
Multiple times it's clearly something he actually believes

915
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,128
And that isn't that people are only afraid

916
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
Of carbon dioxide

917
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,248
Cuz it sounds like carbon monoxide

918
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
Oh boy

919
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
This is very bad

920
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,832
The sun is energy

921
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Light

922
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Carbon dioxide

923
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
Jenna Waters at Harborside

924
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
Very nice

925
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
No option

926
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
So what is it they attack

927
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
Carbon dioxide

928
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Just sounds like Moana

929
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,968
Penn and Teller did it 20 years ago I did it 15 years ago we got to go out and do it again

930
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760

931
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
The name of water scientific

932
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,048
Monoxide is everywhere is toxic

933
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,608
If you drink too much of addiction kill you

934
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
Even better

935
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,136
Table salt has a really scary name

936
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Average

937
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
Person will come to you

938
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
Alex couldn't remember the name of

939
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Table salt

940
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
Yeah I was going to say why didn't you

941
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,656
So proud of knowing what it is

942
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,216
Jordan I hate to say it demonic word here but

943
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Sodium

944
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,288
Chloride get the f*** out

945
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:55,967
Crossed

946
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,759
The sign of a cross

947
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,063
Scandalized weather

948
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:04,927
I might be crazy I might be crazy but I'm going to toss this out for you Dan

949
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,047
Somebody who knows what dihydrogen monoxide is

950
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
Yet believes that

951
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
The president is secretly

952
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Controlled by the devil

953
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,983
He's still dumber than somebody who thinks things are

954
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
What they are

955
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
But it's like

956
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Just say what

957
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Yeah that's my belief

958
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,759
And I think that you're leaving all that aside I know you may be right you may be wrong

959
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
My conjecture is

960
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,623
Anybody who thinks one of these kinds of

961
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,695
Studies of the public means anything

962
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
Is a dick

963
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
And they don't they don't have much going on

964
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
I mean you don't

965
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,935
You don't remember the greatest poster it before there was 538 then

966
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
Where was Jay Leno

967
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:53,311
All right or when you do jaywalking you get the right result

968
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
Yeah

969
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,407
I tricked you

970
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,943
Scientific tools

971
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
F*** you

972
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Yeah

973
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,343
So we just got one last clip here and

974
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,183
I mean read the report ends with Alex sitting in a dark Studio

975
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
Internet

976
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
Actually ends with him yelling

977
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
About how the New World Order is going down

978
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
And just do visual of it of him

979
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
Sitting in a

980
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:24,031
Completely dark is like a review that is Andy Daly

981
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,615
Review it is exactly that

982
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,175
Guys where's everybody why is everybody leaving

983
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,223
What was going on

984
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:37,343
Yeah there's a guy didn't hate him so much there be a little bit of pesos in the moment

985
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Of him sitting

986
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,743
Pacific you've got to destroy the public

987
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,559
I choose not to and re-up

988
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,375
Episode of that club because honestly it's angry

989
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
It's kind of funny

990
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
To think about but it

991
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
It's meaningless

992
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Compared

993
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
To this

994
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
This clip

995
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
Fixes everything

996
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
That you need to know

997
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
I understand

998
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,247
300 books on

999
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,575
Correct

1000
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,647
Doesn't read 100 books on Rome

00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,463

Nope.

1010
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
Just because I have to

1011
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,343
To get into it when I was like

1012
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
9 years old

1013
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559

00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
Cuz the government shut the power off

1019
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Power plant

1020
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,367
Yeah I think that's a good summation of Alex

1021
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,695
Bragging about books he's read that he hasn't read

1022
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
What what hundred books

1023

1024
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:28,447
I don't know just rambling about how well ready is it and he's not like normal people cuz he's

1025
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
He's figured all this out

1026
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
Because he's so smart and read all this s***

1027
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Atlantic

1028
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,335

1030
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,479
Chipper lyrics

1031
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:46,623
The greatest minds of my generation

1032
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
Buy a little chip in the tooth

1033
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,439
For want to do it

1034
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
For want of a toothpick

1035
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
The greatest minds of my generation

1036
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
I've been torn asunder

1037
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Yeah

1038
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375

00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Yeah that's not good

1041
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
So I

1042
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,871
Yeah I just wanted to check in with you and let you know how things go we're going for Alex and it turned out

1043
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,919
This is how it's going

1044
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,247
Last week last week I know of him at

1045
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,551
At the time they were recording this he's just sitting alone

1046
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
And I'd Ark

1047
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087

1049
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,671
Notes no telling when he'll be back

1050
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:27,327
I I do like the idea of somebody showed up at the office tomorrow turn the lights off in Alex's just

1051
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,911
At the desk just like eyes haven't blunk

1052
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
20 hours

1053
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:39,359
He's actually wearing a tie is more put together than usual

1054
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
By flooding the office for the first time in a long time

1055
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Feels really great

1056
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,319
I didn't I don't know if you know this but you can read in the dark

1057
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,719
Probably in better comprehension of stuff

1058
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
Then he does

1059
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:01,119
Guys I started reading book so with my hands even if they aren't in Braille

1060
