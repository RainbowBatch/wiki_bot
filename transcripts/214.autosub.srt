00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
Dan

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Earlier today

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,696
Got my car

6
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,008
Go to work

7
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
But hopefully this one

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,624
Hey sorry we didn't have an episode on Monday

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,024
Technical issues personnel

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,144
Well we recorded it on Saturday

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,728
Write following

12
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,288
Existence in revealing that

13
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
The Supreme Court is

14
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
Nonexistent

15
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
On any sort of executive power

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
We split a bottle of whiskey we may have gotten a little bit

17
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,856
To f*****-up

18
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
First

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
45 minutes out there were technical issues that I just was not keep

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Because of

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
But when I listen to about like the possibility

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Quite right

23
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,480
Covered Kavanaugh's livestream Kavanaugh

24
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Confirmation

25
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
Glad to hear I got the vote as

26
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,904
Is it work and there was something that just wasn't quite right there was an element that was missing

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Answer today what we're going to be

28
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,304
Going over what I believe is the element that was missing of that

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
Well covering the important points

30
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Alex

31
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Cuz live stream of

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Cavanaugh's

33
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:22,592
I know that's a little bit complicated little convoluted maybe to understand off the top I promise

34
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Things will make sense

35
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
As we go along

36
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
Annual

37
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
That was missing from our original

38
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
But it's one of those things that auto show it's kind of difficult

39
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Cover

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
Like immediate news

41
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Because of just the

42
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
The time can

43
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Strafe

44
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
The contextualisation

45
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
Needs to be done

46
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
Pulling

47
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Pieces for luck

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
If we rush things

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,912
Sometimes I think that we miss Elam

50
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
Correct

51
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
It's hard

52
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,920
And we have

53
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
I have nothing but respect for a couple of new donors

54
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,256

Angela Bassett

Morris Chestnut

00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
Forest Whitaker

62
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Idiom

63
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Less less fun than Forest Whitaker

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
I'm a policy wonk also one last breath

65
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,896
We appreciate it oh so very much you are now a technocrat

Jar Jar Binks has a car

68
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
I don't want

69
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Thank you again

70
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,007
Thank you very much

71
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,591
You can do so by going to knowledge fight.com quicknet sport the show button

72
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
And I would appreciate it

73
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
You know what

74
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
If you can't support the show

75
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,087
Find the nearest person with disposable income don't even tell them about the show

76
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
Just tell them to collect the support the show button

77
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
We don't need listeners

78
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Actually

79
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
A lot.

80
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
I'm going to walk you through

81
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
It's going to be

82
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
Confusing

83
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Probably

84
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Maybe slightly nonlinear

85
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Make sense

86
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
I think

87
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Hopefully we'll see

88
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
What world

89
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,647
Do you want what someone else has gotten less it's

90
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,999
Alright now this is why we can't release our drunk episode alright

91
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
But we don't want to Monday episode from us that sounds like a whatever episode from him

92
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
That and we were talking about Harry isn't it cool to steal someone's very attractive Broad

93
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Wework

94
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,783
Doing primarily is looking at some of the

95
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,135
Between the day that Alex Jones celebrate

96
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
On-air on his livestream

97
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
The confirmation of Kavanaugh

98
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
And

99
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Some of his celebration

100
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
From

101
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
The 2016

102
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
I went back and I tried to

103
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,519
Find the entire video of Alex Jones on election

104
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
52 hour livestream

105
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Pure grape

106
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:12,479
Hours of Alex in 49 hours of his underlings

107
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
Spilling in it but I couldn't find

108
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Some of the lake

109
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Really really talks

110
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
6.

111
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
Because Alex's YouTube channel

112
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,559
So most of the videos that he had uploaded

113
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Disappeared

114
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,935
And a lot of the people who have posted Infowars coverage tonight

115
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
Right after Trump gives his victory speech

116
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
But that's not when the show

117
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,919
And everyone was celebrating and a lot of the stuff

118
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
I've discussed about the idea.

119
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
Watching videos of Hillary supporters crying and

120
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
Like that is from that

121
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,903
So thankfully I didn't have to re-watch it at that

122
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Necessarily

123
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
That stuff towards the end of the night where

124
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
No became clear what the game was

125
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
But going back

126
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
And listening to a lot of that

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Nike stuff

128
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
I realize that

129
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
The missing piece

130
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Steam the parallel

131
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Between these two

132
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,335
Two very major celebrations that Alex has had

133
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Pink Give us

134
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
The key that we need

135
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
To unlock

136
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
What he's really talking about

137
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Dim sum

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,367
That's interesting that people who keep those clips would ended at

139
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Alexa

140
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
It's like

141
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
We're at the end of America

142
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
But they forgot

143
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
Watch the beginning of

144
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Cruel cruel

145
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,031
Cruel replacement it's far more important

146
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
22c the world that we are going to become

147
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Within

148
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
10 minutes

149
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Of the world we were ending

150
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,807
The only thing that remains is a video that you can find on Paul Joseph Watson YouTube

151
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Taking down

152
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,719
I don't know why but there is a video about like

153
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Cry-Baby Hillary fan

154
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
And so there is a lot of video on there of

155
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
You know this video that they were mocking

156
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
Instabulul on Election night

157
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,775
With like wind sound effects of interspersed

158
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Pictures of crying baby

159
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,151
And stuff like that

160
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Okay just bring me back some of that

161
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
But it's not good for our purpose

162
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
It's not the same by Audio then

163
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
I'm in the studio

164
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
Just apologize quad Cinema

165
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Report

166
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Where is dark here with

167
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Is from the cabin

168
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Confirmation

169
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Stream

170
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
Where Alex

171
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
This for you

172
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,847
They're almost done

173
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
Just like a 20 months ago

174
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
The Democrats

175
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Is it the first

176
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
The next one we win

177
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Slide with a red wave in 30 days

178
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
Election fraud two pizzas we are going to win

179
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,607
Michelle this isn't a political realignment against Realty

180
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,447
You made the comparison for us this is like Alexa

181
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
Now one of the things that's really interesting in that clip is the he is making the pre-emptive excuse for the midterm

182
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
That if they they're cheating works

183
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,759
Yeah. R r

184
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Phase of this

185
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
Triggering our or whatever he wants to call

186
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Now that's interesting

187
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
Because I went back

188
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
At the beginning of Alex's stream

189
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
He didn't think Trump was going to win

190
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Even on Election Day

191
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Didn't think Trump was going to win

192
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Listen to this s***

193
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,751
But I look at how Christians in the West

194
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,871
Ended slavery Friday in sexism and tried to build everybody up

195
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
And the Very people we tried to build up

196
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
Just roll reversed

197
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
When the Christians

198
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
Who tried to end all the tyranny

199
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
And they reverse it said you're the slave now

200
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
You're the subhuman

201
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,815
You're the reason there's problems you're the white male you're the mobile

202
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
I just wanted freedom

203
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
They say it's over

204
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Heil Hitler

205
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,127
As they destroy the West

206
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
Running

207
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
On the planet

208
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
Cares about people that

209
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
I'm not the prey on you but I got up I got to pull back I got to isolate myself and just let you kill yourself okay you want

CC there at the end I'm sorry the vampires because

212
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Preemptively emotionally preparing

213
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
The Narrative to beat Clinton is going to win

214
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
And at the beginning

215
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,319

Christian males

Are the ones who wanted to free us

220
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,823
Kill myself they only wanted Freedom where everybody murder suicide a crime

221
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Yeah

00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
They wanted freedom

223
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
They work

224
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
To you know help women equal

225
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
And they got rid of slavery

226

Wichita

227
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Specifically about minorities and women

228
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
That support Hillary Clinton have turned around

229
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,703
And are now trying to they flip the script only

230
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Great Christian men

231
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Spaceship

232
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
In society

233
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,407
All the rest of the world is barbarism only white Christian man or really the

234
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
The people who are you know they want to go around and

235
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Maybe they want to build things

236
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
This is not

237
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,391

238
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Evinrude history

Life is meaningless

Rihanna work

241
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Why

Why are we bothering with these people in that clip like how important these victim

243
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
Is to that identity video

244
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Of the white Christian Bale

245
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
He have to

246
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
Package it within the idea I'd like we try to help you so much and now you turned on us while you do that

Ted now

249
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
This is what I'm saying I'm not saying why why are we reading

250
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,175
Some people think you know what Trump people think being white is great

251
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
Every profile of a trump voter to just be like

252
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,063
Hey you know how wide is these people think it is

253
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Chanel

254
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
But

255
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
He goes on

256
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Steal from his at

257
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
His livestream on the election

258
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,007
Sunday

259
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,359
Within the context again of him believing the Trump isn't going to win

260
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
I'm sorry the Vampires will now have I'm sorry

261
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
It's what you wanted

262

I'm sorry you won't get tax cut she won't get prosperity

263
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
CNN in NPR

264
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
Telling you how you're in your car

265
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
In a fantasy

266
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
That you're in charge lie about 40 as a woman

267
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
We'll try to find Amanda men won't want to be with you because

268
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,191
They're scared

269
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,175
You bought it before the liquid acetone dissolve the fertilizer to grow the elite cross

270
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
With you

271
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
If you want the villain

272
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
You were just a species women being killed

273
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Show this grave marker

274
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
For your death

275
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
A planet

276
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,103
Will be your Victory as you die full of morphine worshipping

277
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
And so it's Contra perceptions reality

278
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
That you never exist

279
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Azad's

280
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Analyze

281
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
You worship Al-Qaeda you worship Isis she worship burkas

282
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
You worship anything destructive of the West

283
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
Because the West is such a beautiful goddess

284
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
You were

285
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
Ashamed of yourself

286
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:25,439
That's a little silly

287
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Look

288
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Be prioritizing getting with a western man on clothes

289
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:49,759
And then you'll be so happy and all the men who'll be around will be available for you

290
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:56,159
Daniel get into serving and then they'll give you an acid

291
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
Like for real does he know what Venus

292
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
Look I mean I mean it literally means

293
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
The genocide of alias

294
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Domino's side

295
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,751
Yoshino morph

296
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,591
So even though even while he's saying like this

297
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
Suggest that working with aliens

298
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
To get rid of

299
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,343
We're fighting against aliens or maybe all people who aren't white people are aliens

300
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,975
All non-white people are ate I think he believes the globalist are working with aliens

301
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
He sees himself as alien

302
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
So that word

303
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,215
Might actually be appropriate in the goofiest way

304
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Like maybe we're not from here

305
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Maybe we're not even supposed to be here

306
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Okay maybe we're not

307
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
What can I look at a summer home

308
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,015
Let's all get a summer home

309
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
Live on Mars

310
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Where else you got

311
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
I think that's a great place for white males B

312
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,327
Mall in there keep you safe and warm

313
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,727
Okay we can go and visit every now and again

314
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Pick another possibility

315
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,831
It wouldn't involve space colonies people growing up

316
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
A little bit but

317
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,583
Alright alright

318
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
It's a rehabilitation Colony you have a sporting group

319
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
False

320
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Place

321
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,895
Where they're separated from any place like a

322
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
Oh no nevermind so far left your other fashion

323
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,695
No I'm now getting what I that kind of sounds like and I don't think it's a good thing

324
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
Alright

325
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
It's interesting here

326
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
To hear that

327
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
The election day

328
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
2016 Alex

329
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Was pretty

330
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
Emotionally prepared for Trump to lose

331
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
And in preparation for that

332
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Doing all of this like

333
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Oh you idiot

334
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
You've destroyed the West

335
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
Because you women are harpies and

336
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,719
All you blacks that we wrote that's white Christians rose out of slavery

337
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
Value Pawn Donna turned on us

338
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,423
How do you not realize that we ended slavery

339
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,031
So Alex is in that place and it's Super Why

340
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,919
Weird as the day goes on clear that Trump is going to win

341
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
He changes over the course of it a little bit

342
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
Something that I find

343
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Freemelly interesting

344
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
Is there a couple of

345
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Direct

346
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Parallel

347
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,207
Linguist in Stylistics

348
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
Between the Kavanaugh confirmation

349
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Stream

350
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
The election

351
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
2016

352
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Here's the first of them

353
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Is from the Kavanaugh

354
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
This will be a day long remembered

355
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
We've seen the end

356
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407
Will show us in the end of George Soros

357
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
I apologize

358
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
That was from 2016 the election

359
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
This

360
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Is from

361
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
The Kavanaugh

362
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
This will be a daddy long leg

363
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
We've seen the end of Hillary

364
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
Wilson

365
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Upendra

366
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
We paid a lot for this

367
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Please don't take the girl

368
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
Total human domination biological operation

369
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
The difference is a little bit more

370
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
It was pretty

371
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Right but I don't think

372
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
Fighting back against the rose wanting to

373
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Make your kids trans

374
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,119
Or something like that the last time the Koch brothers gave an interview

375
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
See you there we go

376
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
I don't know what they're imagining their fighting back again

377
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:32,639
The real world

378
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,735
Hi women's rights Union

379
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
You know there's really Gotta Fight Back Again

380
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Climate change

381
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
I mean

382
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
You got to fight back against doing anything about climate

383
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
For what I make

384
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Like

385
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
A decade from now only you and your Rich Pals will be

386
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
What is a pre-emptive economic maneuver

387
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Very smart

388
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:14,367
That is super interesting to me that we here in both cases I am doing his Vader voice

389
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,208
Ain't saying the exact same thing we seen the end of Clinton will soon see the end

390
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
That alone is kind of like

391
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,704
Cuz I don't hear him say that he doesn't like the Vader voice a lot of the emperor

392
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,848
You have done what he does that a lot

393
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
When is this supposed to be Churchill

394
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
I don't think so

395
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Star Wars

396
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,880
That will be long remembered

397
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,488
Maybe it is

398
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,888
For me to think it's

399
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
Just kind of blend together

400
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
Adjust mix metaphors and character

401
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,664
Similarity another one

402
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
This very very specific

403
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
I want to salute you all

404
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
I drag my ass up

405
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
25 years ago

406
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
High school graduate

407
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,560
Texas City AutoZone

408
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,680
I decided I'd kick that ass cuz I looked at my enemy and they were a bug-eyed pussies

409
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Wisconsin

410
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,944
Because big jackass Cruise website

411
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
So

412
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,368
What do you seems to be offended by

413
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
That makes that makes more sense

414
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,560
Big old groups in the bug-eyed knows that's where you go

415
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:04,448
But uses that

416
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,032
Is the idea that go around and I want to piss all over everybody

417
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,104
What's from the 2016 election stream

418
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Here is him

419
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
On the Kavanaugh

420
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
The Democrats remember

421
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Hundred years when America was

422
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,024
We were asleep we weren't awake

423
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
You weren't intimidated

424
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,824
All you got to do now

425
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
We get

426
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
Politically

427
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
Arms around your neck

428
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
Sew-ins again

429
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,368
He seems to think that is the way he expresses

430
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
People doing him wrong

431
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,000
Kp.org

432
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,400
Enjoy a lot of people

433
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
Straight up you know you could turn it into a sexual pleasure

434
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,032
Documentaries

435
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,944
Is that the fear you're going with Alex Jones

436
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
And that's why he's so unhappy with he's got.

437
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
And that what

438
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
I don't think we

439
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
We should be

440
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
For me

441
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
I think you should vary joyfully if

442
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
You see Alex Jones

443
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,120
Asking politely if you would like if you if you would like you to Piana

444
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,520
The resolution of our New Year's resolutions

445
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,640
Hey man I know what's up

446
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
Do you want me to pee on you

447
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
We're having a good night

448
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,344
Maybe on your leg

449
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
With your consent of course

450
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
What is it one of the interesting things I

451
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
Is to look at state

452
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
And look at

453
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
What Alex

454
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Who's presenting

455
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,984
To the world as what's going to happen

456
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
Various

457
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
So here is a clip

458
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
From

459
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
The 26

460
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
16 election

461
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
What are you talkin about

462
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,272
You know how

463
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
And Hillary immediately conceive

464
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
A little bit later in the night

465
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
She called Trump

466
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
We can feed intro

467
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
She didn't give a speech until the morning

468
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Alex

469
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,144
In the in the intervening.

470
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Is convinced that she's not going

471
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Concede

472
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
And it's War

473
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,824
So he he comes up with this Theory

474
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,128
The Trump needs to immediately

475
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,200
Come out and give a speech declaring himself the winner

476
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,784
Because possession is flaw

477
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Which doesn't make any sense

478
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
But he has this idea that if he can

479
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Get Trump

480
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,536
To give the speech announcing that he's won Hillary can't undo that

481
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,680
Or something like that

482
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,728
I believe

483
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:24,128
Termite as a trick

484
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,720
Dibs are real at as long as you say your president your president

485
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Feedback

486
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,536
Is going to be like that's going to be

487
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,168
In the Constitution

488
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:55,360
Alex keeps Rodger Stone to call Steve

489
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,688
Give the speech already like that's very weird

490
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,016
What year was Alex expressing some of his fears about what could happen

491
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
If Trump doesn't

492
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Declare himself the winner

493
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,232
Plane will not spin tonight

494
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
Axelrod on the Clinton News Network

495
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Malamute

496
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
I'd say he is the winner

497
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
Have Obama launched a nuclear war tomorrow at by the way

498
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,616
I got a bad feeling I'm not saying that

499
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
For a fact

500
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,688
People know I don't play games okay

501
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
Better get that to their heads

502
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
He only plays games

503
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,928
But you have to give his speech

504
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,840
She's going to have Obama GoNoodle somebody in order to make sure that he doesn't

505
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
Or something along those lines

506
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
I don't know

507
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
I think he

508
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
I think it another point he says that she's going to Nuke Russia

509
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
Probably

510
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
So

511
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Now if you were to Nuke

512
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
Somebody that would be

513
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
A lot of death

514
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Certainly

515
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
Great song title

516
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,952
A lot of death

517
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:18,560
We make it like a slow jam

518
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,376
Dire Straits

519
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,032
Guitar licks

520
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,080
Get it going I'm into it

521
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
Let's do that

522
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,736
End portal

523
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,160
Real negative view of what the globalist are gone

524
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,768
Really weird to hear Alex say something like

525
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,584
On the David Cavanaugh

526
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Supreme Court

527
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,656
Describing his best case scenario

528
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,984
Of what is going to happen now that the Patriots are in charge of every

529
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
There is a path

530
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
If we take it this God give us free will

531
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
That has limited problem

532
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Billions

533
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
Remedy

534
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Futures

535
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Space time continuum

536
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,768
Because again I am a psychic and I have said that multiple times

537
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,096
Towards a real victory in the future

538
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
And it's a limited but it's like

539
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
Chicken

540
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
Bullseye

541
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
Try to get it for you can't do it

542
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,432
You've got to just decide you wanted spiritually

543
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,112
And I want to demoralize the Enemy by telling the truth right now giving a big secret

544
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Which they don't have next level

545
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Naked

546
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
That's why they're so pissed at me and others

547
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,096
In about 95% of

548
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
Possible futures

549
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
We went

550
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,824
Sahara realizing how to that

551
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,640
And if they do succeed

552
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
What would be like

553
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,808
He's nightmare scenario on Election night at Hillary's going to Nuke someone

554
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
Make sure Trump doesn't become

555
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,440
Then multiple billions of people dying

556
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:26,304
Which is describing in more present-day as being

557
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
The best

558
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
Case scenario for

559
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
His movement

560
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
Surviving in women

561
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
Epic

562
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
Fitzwater freshest thing

563
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,128
Sure

564
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,320
We're going to win 95% chance

565
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,648
You know results in the less violent

566
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,000
If you just let us win now we're going to have to

567
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:00,352
We're going to have to do some of those other 95% Futures where

568
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,752
Here is a way

569
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,688
Yeah it's really like that

570
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
If we are to win

571
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
It is going to require us

572
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,600
The team who is going to win

573
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
To inflict

574
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
At least

575
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488
At least two billion people dying like

576
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,888
What is about a third of the world's population has got to die in his

577
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
He doesn't believe in climate change

578
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,848
So he doesn't believe it like that could be a

579
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Extensible argument

580
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,944
Or something he's trying to talk about

581
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:50,016
So he thinks there's going to be two billion people dead

582
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,344
Just from like we're going to have to kill all the Muslims

583
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:00,768
I have very little doubt that that

584
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,560
At least a large piece

585
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,376
Of what use Imagining the best-case scenario

586
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
Is Betty

587
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
Please describe

588
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
Which

589
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,752
Profoundly scarier than

590
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
His

591
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,128
Very baseless idea that Hillary Clinton was going to have Barack Obama nuke

592
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
This is he

593
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,736
Does he have like

594
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
After the billions

595
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:29,184
Lex is so far his stay in Utopia of some sort where everyone has guns

596
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,256
Everyone has their own

597
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Money talk

598
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,960
Slavery is just sort of like it's just an economic agreement that anyone could enter into theirs

599
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
Who knows duress isn't a real thing and everybody gave us free will everybody would have their own competing

600
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,944
Currencies that you have to spend

601
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Figure out how to

602
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
Transfer among each other

603
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
You couldn't

604
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
Usually I mean if you're able

605
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,928
Missouri dollars in Illinois

606
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
Or if you do they probably be worth less

607
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
Excellently are in Missouri

608
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:17,056
Missouri's economy is not going to be

609
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Backed up

610
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:26,272
Well that's Preserve

611
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,368
Andro courtware if you

612
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
With someone you have your favorite Court

613
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:37,024
You go and appeal your case in front of they probably have their own Court

614
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,144
It is now

615
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Justice system is

616
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:53,920
If we end up in like some sort of a libertarian

617
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
Competing currencies

618
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Screw up all sorts

619
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
The transaction

620
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
Everybody's Australia antagonistic towards each other

621
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
Billion people

622
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Hooray

623
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
The worst

624
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:14,144
I mean a lot of people are going to die in the Visa vs. MasterCard

625
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,544
In order to figure out who becomes the dominant credit card holder

626
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,568
MC get of army

627
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,968
Doesn't already have a bit of an army tucked away Zone

628
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Like

629
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
Incredibly insane

630
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,416
Good scenario involves that much.

631
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,976
Is that lead me to believe

632
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
I think you probably got it

633
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Perfect that's almost a threat

634
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,656
Exactly four goals a lot like a threat

635
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,264
Navigate to another like real direct similarity but

636
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
Queen of the Kavanaugh

637
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,360
Swearing-in vote day

638
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
16 election

639
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Alex brings up

640
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,272
About the people are against

641
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
Suicide

642
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Very

643
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
Very similar

644
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,928
Here is him talking about

645
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
The stuff on

646
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
See the Kavanaugh

647
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
Vote day

648
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:21,984
Which confirms and defense of free speech

649
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,544
Defensive new process defense of

650
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
Party operatives

651
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,088
Try to block the nomination of a good man the Supreme Court

652
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,672
Really here is a referendum on the intimidation

653
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,072
George Soros

654
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Group

655
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
Where they kill gays and enslave women in

656
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,872
Forcibly abort little girls and kill little baby girls

657
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
You've got these women out here

658
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,528
That believe in there fighting

659
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
Your father brother their son

660
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
Since we're all one species

661
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
Some women are good some are good

662
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,584
So he invalidates criticism by

663
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,424
Start of everybody's on everybody

664
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Which is all great

665
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
The standard stuff

666
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,056
That's really specific there is the idea that these women

667
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,848
Are just mad at her dad

668
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,432
It's

669
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,784
Show us a fan of him immediately invalidated

670
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:44,160
What he saying in the middle of it like these women angry like

671
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
Yeah because you just said

672
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,280
With absolute disdain

673
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,864
You just said just these women as though you're like

674
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Why are these

675
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,216
I mean I have to call them people I spoke

676
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
Ensure

677
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Bad women

678
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,784
You know the good women are the ones who do whatever I tell them to lock her up

679
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,368
These women like us they must be mad at their dads

680
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,928
I can't possibly be I'm an ass

681
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
Kind of rhetoric

682
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,752
He's expressing that these women are just mad at their dads

683
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Is a pentagon

684
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
To take cars around the time of

685
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
The election

686
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
Also some women who were pretty mad

687
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
Things to say about the Democrat

688
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Mike down

689
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
Because

690
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
You will not believe how this

691
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,976
And the Democrats are running around slumming at the mouth

692
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,560
SSS

693
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Car culture

694
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,728
Look up don't have parents I feel sorry for their money

695
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
18-wheelers is Daddy's come over on

696
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
I-35

697
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
David they saved

698
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,904
Donald Trump elected president

699
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
136 Central

700
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
236 East

701
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
We're not hearing

702
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,424
They'll probably announce

703
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
Wasn't there.

704
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Christian David

705
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,384
All I know is we're going to continue on

706
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
We're going to fight the New World Order

707
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,016
Because we believe in prosperity

708
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,832
We don't want to rape you in your family

709
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,392
That's why we got free shipping running before the

710
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
Watch Big Discount 40% off a horse Florida

711
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,912
Oh my God

712
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,216
Because we all want to rape your kids

713
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:11,616
You don't Sephora charges for shipping ohmygod

714
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
That was so wild

715
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
To me like that.

716
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,088
No add pivot can ever touch that

717
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,696
That's why we have free shipping

718
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
There's only one reason maybe there's another reason the use of those words like him

719
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,056
If you could just you could disconnect

720
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Basalt

721
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,176
You could be like we're going to keep fighting because we know that they

722
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,992
Want to rape your family and we're not into that

723
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,576
By the way by the way

724
00:39:53,856 --> 00:40:00,000
Completely unrelated we have free shipping

725
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,664
That's why it's 20% off

726
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
On our way

727
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,272
Jesus

728
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
Democrats who are protesting against Trump

729
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Have Dad

730
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,440
They don't have it they don't have parents and it's so sad they're like Duck

731
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Alright man

732
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,560
It's it's a good way to sort of

733
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
Empathy dehumanize

734
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
Your Pony

735
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,544
People who believe other things than you

736
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,896
Really

737
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,712
The only reason you're mad is because you're

738
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
You don't have Tara

739
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Steal your right

740
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
So here is another

741
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,512
Almost

742
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
During the Kavanaugh scream and the elections

743
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
This one here is from the cabin

744
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Know that we could rule the planet

745
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
If we only submitted

746
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,152
We built

747
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
Surveillance system bhagat

748
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
So he can have more power if you was down with

749
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,112
Here's what he said on the election

750
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,720
I can't bring myself to see if I did I'd be

751
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
20 times more powerful

752
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,575
I mean it's sort of like a preoccupation that he has

753
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
See very clearly

754
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
Good

755
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,023
I must be good because I'd be more successful if I was bad

756
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Which suggests

757
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Success is because I am

758
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,335
As opposed to it don't have done bad things along the way

759
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,639
In spite of you being good

760
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:30,015
You are still successful even though

761
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,111
Which considered a multi-level marketing scheme

762
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,927
Is literally feeding on people

763
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:41,279
Absolutely literal 12

764
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095
Forgetting people tricked on auto-ship

765
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
Or something like that

766
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:50,239
Or trying to convince people that they need your iodine in order to be healthy

767
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:55,359
I'd like just trying to cook convince people that they're somehow deficient because of what they quote globalist have done

768
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,551
In order for you to monetize their response to those ideas

769
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,367
Is the definition of feeding off people that's all he does

770
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,951
This is like earlier he said he doesn't play games he plays so many games

771
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,743
The gamesmen

772
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
He's a parasite

773
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
He is a

774
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
F****** parasite

775
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
Sucking the life out of the

776
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Or something to that

777
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
So

778
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
Able to find the

779
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
Before videos of

780
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
The the display of Cruelty

781
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
It goes on

782
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
At the end of the 20

783
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Election

784
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,087
I'm glad that

785
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,183
You know to not necessarily watch that all over again

786
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
But

787
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
I will say that there's a couple

788
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,327
Very Stark parallels that relate to that

789
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
In terms of

790
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
Mice

791
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
Barnes firm conviction

792
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
Is that

793
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
Alex Jones

794
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
On Election night

795
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Made

796
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
Everyone involved

797
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,943
Maybe they went out of their way in order to victimize the

798
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
People on the other side

799
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
People who are crying

800
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,551
Show videos of them laughed at them

801
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Just made

802
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,135
Fort out of the idea of like haha look at these losers

803
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
Aren't we great we're not them

804
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Their loser

805
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,791
And you don't have to sort of buildup IS idea that those

806
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
You know I don't notice

807
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
20 year old

808
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,119
22 year old girls

809
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
Women who work

810
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
We're somehow oppressing

811
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
But be that as it may

812
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,311
That was the demonstration

813
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
On

814
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,199
It was what the show was largely about outside of

815
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,503
Alex getting a little bit weird and saying but

816
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
Stupid b*******

817
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
The visual That Remains

818
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,183
As evidenced by the next Paul Joseph Watson putting out that compilation

819
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,487
Of people crying and he put his ass out

820
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Exonerate

821
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,351
What they wanted to drive home is like look at these these stupid loser

822
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Crying because

823
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
When the Cavanaugh Street

824
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,983
Alex is trying desperately

825
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,263
To recreate that

826
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,359
So he kept going out to Millie Weaver on the street trying to get video

827
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
Of her finding people crying

828
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
So he kept trying to make it happen

829
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,039
The only way he was able to 6

830
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,855
Get that feeling back at all

831
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
Was by having Darren

832
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Mcbreen

833
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,231
Come into the studio his employees

834
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
Video producer Darren

835
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Brain

836
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
So the two of them

837
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
Could get super cruel

838
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
About the idea that

839
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Cavanaugh going on

840
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,703
Supreme Court was going to cause liberal

841
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
To cry

842
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,175
Pontificate all day but

843
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,247
Coldwell on Greg Harwell

844
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,807
All the s*** they've done. Us and finally we're winning

845
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,879
What's better than the confirmation

846
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
Is going to be the aftermath

847
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,095
List all the butt hurt and seeing the crying and ended the the total liberal meltdown

848
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
I'm going to just

849
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,679
Bask in the liberal tears

850
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,287
Stream of the election night 2016

851
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:10,687
We get to see the triggering now I mean they're they're going to have them in those jeans today.

852
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,439
Or something right

853
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,791
Too bad acting up it

854
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,423
So there's a young lady to get a word in edgewise

855
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
Well Joe Biggs

856
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,823
David

857
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,919
Stephen trying to say something awful and they wouldn't let her

858
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
God

859
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
Yep wonder where she is now

860
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,855
Probably

861
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,975
Interesting

862
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,279
Wild almost like that

863
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,351
Kind of what it's about you know if these guys were soldiers

864
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:11,103
Play somebody is

865
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,223
War crimes in space

866
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,527
Pretty much all my God

867
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,343
A hundred percent sure they would as long as

868
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Long as we get to see them

869
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
Because it's funny

870
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Feel like it

871
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,911
Another human being

872
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
I mean

873
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:44,383
It is it is pretty f***** up but it is what they are all about

874
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
Here if I'm election 26

875
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,063
Trending things on Twitter right now

876
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,367
United States of anxiety

877
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,255
America is over party

878
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,863
America has now been Vindicated

879
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,167
The American people have now been heard

880
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,727
We have taken over everything

881
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,799
Using social medias we have completely

882
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,359
Transform the narrative

883
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,175
For so many years

884
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
What to do what to think

885
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,319
What's a way to do respect people

886
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,599
Bowie told to do

887
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,647
What was the oppression

888
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,751
And if I start to make other people feel bad

889
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:51,199
Do not suggest that maybe I'm the one who's doing something wrong I can't allow myself to think that for even a second

890
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
What is there

891
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:59,391
Faking feeling bad in order to make me feel bad they're victimizing me with their feelings

892
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:05,279
Hang them to act like they feel bad real enemy is

893
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Monster

894
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,215
Literal monster

895
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,823
So Joe Biggs is mocking the idea that people are tweeting about anxiety which

896
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
I imagine as we've discussed

897
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,943
Ad nauseam

898
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
Obviously felt like

899
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,951
Ability

900
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
Vindicated

901
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,607
Here

902
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:45,983
Judge is already calling it for Trump and also I just tweeted out pictures from inside

903
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,383
Hillary Clinton's our celebration area

904
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
Hit the glass ceiling

905
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
Play sad

906
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Is it

907
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,463
Is a small version of what I've been talkin

908
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,071
Things that I remember is not just

909
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,863
Joe Biggs David Knight

910
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,959
And around blasting it pictures

911
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
These people crying

912
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,591
He was in the studio later

913
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,383
But that's exactly what was going on

914
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,199
You see that and that's a dark picture

915
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,503
That's a dark picture of Anubis operate

916
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
He just said

917
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,879
She was hitting the literal glass ceiling

918
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
He did say that

919
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,999
So that means knows that the glass ceiling does exist

920
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
And he

921
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,095
Enjoys and appreciates that it does

922
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
Whatever the building

923
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
So you was using it as sort of a

924
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Rephrase

925
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
To be a dick

926
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
That's pretty awful

927
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,431
So later in the night

928
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,479
Part that I can't find the video of

929
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:05,599
They sit around and watch the footage of people at Hillary rally

930
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,647
Crying

931
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,463
Bunch of white dudes and whoever that lady is

932
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Ben McAdoo

933
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,047
I wrongly of said the Jakari Jackson was

934
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
Forgotten that

935
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
I think it's all white people I don't see

936
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Single

937
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
It came time

938
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,407
A the Kavanaugh scream

939
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,479
Alex like I said was going out to Millie Weaver trying to

940
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
Her to have footage

941
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,391
Trying to get protesters that they can do this exact same thing

942
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,719
Talk about haha look at all you triggered liberal

943
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
Hahaha

944
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
It didn't happen

945
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
There were people crying

946
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,679
There were people out with

947
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
That's what Millie Weaver was

948
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Capturing

949
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
Xvideo

950
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,591
And Alex wasn't getting what he wanted out of it

951
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
I want to see some of those videos

952
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,831
Reaction to Trump's inauguration for election night

953
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,391
The trailer for

954
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,999
Rodger stone is really good who shows the lepus on?

955
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,839
This is why

956
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
The left hates

957
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Infowars

958
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,423
Show them

959
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
So

960
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,567
Because he couldn't get what he needed during the Kavanaugh stream that he was putting on

961
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,615
But that was the presentation he wanted

962
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,431
He needed to hearken back to

963
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
The original

964
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
Where he was super cruel

965
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
What again

966
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
That's

967
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,903
I don't want to wind an

968
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,719
Winning is boring I want to

969
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
Steal them

970
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,791
Under my boots

971
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,607
Yeah I want to feel them I want them to

972
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:58,239
It's almost like I want them to know what it is I'm about to do to them

973
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,031
Before I can do it

974
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Almost

975
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
I want them to

976
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
Feel the pain of what

977
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,943
Going to get off

978
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
It does seem that way also considering that Alex's dream during the Kavanaugh vote

979
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:19,743
There's not really any conversation about like what this means for the court

980
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,559
Or anything like that outside of like haha

981
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,607
And Alex drawing a lighthouse

982
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,143
Please paper and trying to shoot

983
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,935
His own camera with the cork

984
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,727
Champagne bottle

985
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,775
Twice

986
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:36,639
Except for him desperately trying to get this footage from Millie or wherever he can get it from

987
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,687
He tries to get it from

988
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,503
Let's go back to election night let's get that

989
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,295
And then later in the show

990
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Save

991
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Do this

992
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,767
Play my video

993
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:57,887
Play your video it went they got roaring a roaring last at the crowd

994
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,983
Prediction

995
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,359
The 5-minute video of protesters crying

996
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,919
Millie Weaver on Ganda computer 12

997
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:15,807
5 minutes ago

998
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,231
They believe that they have a five-minute video that mailing his shot of protesters crying which they don't have

999
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,327
They end up playing a video where it's Millie Weaver Wunderground a protest

1000
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
I just being a bunch

1001
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
People locked

1002
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,167
A bunch of people changing

1003
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,703
Bunch people with signs

1004
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
No one crying

1005
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:37,055
No one is doing what they need them to do in order to

1006
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,383
Exercise this cruel spirit that lives Within

1007
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,503
They don't they don't really get what they want but they pretend it's there anyway

1008
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,319
Your Defiance isn't making this fun for us

1009
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
Stop.

1010
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,927
There is there is a little bit

1011
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,839
You can you can speak like Alex ends up ending his dream

1012
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
The cab

1013
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,959
He gives a really long to toast about house

1014
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,751
This champagne is 17

1015
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
76

1016
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
Penny goes off air

1017
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,383
Realizes that he didn't do a good enough job

1018
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,919
He needs to be a little angrier

1019
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
3 dozen

1020
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
And then slams down the glass of

1021
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
On the table breaking

1022
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
Glass

1023
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
And stares into

1024
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
To the camera

1025
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
After he breaks the glass

1026
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:27,231
So is that feeling of he's not getting what he needs out of it

1027
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Going

1028
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
He does like

1029
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
2 hours

1030
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
And that that Kavanaugh stream

1031
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,191
He's not getting what

1032
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Which is this visual did he got on Election night

1033
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
Of people crying

1034
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
People victimized by

1035
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Hughes

1036
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
Quote unquote

1037
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,383
Except

1038
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
That is what he did

1039
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
He needs women

1040
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,759
Tears he needs minorities

1041
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
Feeling scared

1042
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
Or else

1043
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,879
What's the point of this operation anymore

1044
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:00,255
Person on my way home so I can get hard

1045
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
Why are you making this suck

1046
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
I mean

1047
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
Calls back

1048
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,703
To what he was talking about earlier

1049
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
Necklet from the 20s

1050
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,079
Something about the idea of

1051
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
Christian

1052
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:20,735
Got you out of slavery power with you guys have turned on us

1053
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
That is why

1054
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
He feels

1055
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,831
So desperate in order to

1056
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Get those tears

1057
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,135
That's why he's so desperate

1058
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,927
To get that victimization from them

1059
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,231
Because he feels that they've wronged him

1060
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Treated like he

1061
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,839
He feels that they have wronged

1062
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,423
His whiteness and his maleness by asking for equality

1063
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,495
And that's really really hard to

1064
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
Look at

1065
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
Because

1066
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,103
First of all it

1067
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
It's so

1068
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
It's so dumb

1069
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,015
Clearly his Narrative of

1070
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,623
Look white people raise you up we brought you out of this whole thing

1071
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:05,023
And I mean sure we ended I mean yeah sure we enjoy making you feel miserable and

1072
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
Flushing you under our boots

1073
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:12,959
Because we love raising you up so much but you have to be raised up to exactly where I want you to

1074
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:19,615
If you're anywhere else

1075
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
I'm going to be swinging

1076
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,967
And if you get

1077
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
You know

1078
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,295
Out of your station or whatever you know

1079
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,599
The terms that would have been used for

1080
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:33,183
I don't care.

1081
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,975
Iraq

1082
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,279
And then you won't have to cry and make me feel bad

1083
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:43,679
It's your fault

1084
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
I'm a crazy

1085
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:52,127
From your country and sold you into slavery

1086
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:56,735
You are the one thing in a Libertarian world you were the one who said hi

1087
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:02,367
You should never have done that

1088
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:14,143
Now you guys know what we would have done if you guys came to our country

1089
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:18,751
We would have separated from you if you from your family's we're not getting sold into slavery

1090
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,543
We learn from your mistakes

1091
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,639
Insane high in offering us food

1092
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,991
If it sucks but this one's from the 2016 election

1093
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,599
Although I probably the biggest

1094
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,951
I really do I think what they tried to do is essential

1095
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,279
I don't know if it was a hundred percent

1096
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,119
But that was what they ended up doing

1097
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
I think that was where their instinct

1098
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,447
Took them and they loved it

1099
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,543
I think that that cruelty displayed they had of laughing people crying

1100
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
Because they feared for their safety

1101
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,407
I think that was sort of an improvisational

1102
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,967
And then because it was so good

1103
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,271
And they made so much hay out of it

1104
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
Quote unquote

1105
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,599
Viral pieces out of it like Paul Watson

1106
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
Today

1107
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,415
They tried to do that again

1108
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,511
The pageant that they tried to put on

1109
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
That was the entire point

1110
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
So

1111
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
I don't want to undersell then

1112
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
The big piece

1113
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
But Alex

1114
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
Is a couple more really f***** up thing

1115
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
But I don't I didn't remember

1116
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,823
From the 2016 Street

1117
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:29,407
But I think I might have

1118
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
Subconscious

1119
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,479
But I don't remember it like that

1120
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,271
That is one the next one

1121
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,855
Listen to the language he uses here listen to these

1122
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
Syntac

1123
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,927
Because you follow pronoun reference

1124
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,207
You're going to hear something

1125
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Supremely f*****

1126
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:51,167
The evil has been showed how they hate you. They want to bankrupt you how they think you're dumb how they think you're scum

1127
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:56,287
Here's the problem thought you were something

1128
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:02,431
And now an Abomination you use that power to turn us into your slaves where's the news jackass

1129
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:08,319
Hillary slaves and the ruling classes slaves

1130
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:13,183
Those are those are you blow all the same damn thing

1131
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,959
I understand you hate strength

1132
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,263
Because you're ugly

1133
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
So

1134
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
Forbear

1135
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,687
Gave you the right to vote

1136
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,247
And now you're using that against us

1137
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,807
I'll talk to you about vote

1138
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Prosecco

1139
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,695
Originally only Wyoming want to hear 3/5 of what you have to say

1140
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:52,095
Originally only white males in this country that constituted 6% of the population

1141
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,143
Hypothetical

1142
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,679
It wasn't

1143
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:59,519
Except the last date they waved

1144
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:05,407
Boulevard

1145
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,223
A good eight years after the country was founded

1146
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:13,855
In 1870 the 15th amendment was passed laws to prevent voting

1147
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
On the basis

1148
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,439
Color or previous condition of servitude

1149
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,535
Naturally most southern states immediately put into place tons of restrictions message

1150
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:25,631
Disenfranchised the New Black voters

1151
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:30,239
Fun fact

1152
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,823
The really even though there was a constitutional amendment saying otherwise

1153
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,431
Practice still it was mostly just able to

1154
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
In 1887

1155
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,271
Native Americans were granted citizenship

1156
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,807
If that's the ability to vote

1157
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,391
On the condition that they break their association with their tribe

1158
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,207
You got a

1159
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:55,839
You got to get out of that tribe entire Heritage walk away from your past

1160
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,399
And everything that connects you to your ancestors

1161
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
Your lineage all of that stuff

1162
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:05,823
Your culture everything just get rid of it you can vote you can vote if you want to act White

1163
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,455
I would consider that not being able to vote

1164
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,527
Demanding a massive sacrifice of people

1165
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
For the

1166
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,575
Privilege of voting

1167
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:21,183
37 years later the US government finally just a alright fine you don't have to leave your tribe

1168
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:29,887
In 1920 The Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote but let's not pretend for a second they were given that right delete

1169
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,191
Nor the passage of this amendment

1170
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,471
All was well

1171
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:38,591
Disenfranchising forces that were used against non-white

1172
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,431
We're now being applied to help diminish the voting power of non-white women

1173
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Still in play

1174
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,879
17 residents of Washington

1175
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,951
SeaWorld allowed to vote in general elections until 1960

1176
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,023
5

1177
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:01,375
Residents of Guam the Virgin Islands Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico

1178
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,935
Vote in general election

1179
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,959
America

1180
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
Samoa

1181
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
So they're not there

1182
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,127
Also fun little fact is that

1183
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,943
The right to own property

1184
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
1865

1185
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,527
The lingering effect of the Chinese Exclusion Act

1186
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,879
Can't imagine they were allowed to vote while they weren't allowed to own s***

1187
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:28,255
Hey if you if you want to own s*** you got to vote

1188
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,887
Abusing the power that we gave you

1189
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,983
Whatever it is

1190
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,263
Whatever it is

1191
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,591
Is that your forbearers giving you the right to

1192
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,663
Because some of this stuff is shocking

1193
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
You know like

1194
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,711
First of all for those like

1195
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
Us

1196
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,551
People US citizens in like Frederico Guam

1197
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,719
The Washington DC was the last generation

1198
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:02,047
That's like Alex do 10 years before he was born

1199
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,863
1920 with the 19th Amendment

1200
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,167
Not your forebears at your grandpa

1201
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,775
He says your forebears he's talkin about the founding of this country

1202
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,383
He's talking about he's shaming White

1203
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
Listen to this again

1204
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:27,903
The evil has been showed how they hate you. They went bankrupt you're dumb how they think you're scum

1205
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:32,767
Here's the problem thought you were something

1206
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:39,167
And now an Abomination you use that power to turn us into your slaves will hear the news jackass

1207
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,751
He's talking to white people who don't fall into his

1208
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
Plan

1209
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,311
Don't fall into his program

1210
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,407
Talking about the people who got the right to vote

1211
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Later

1212
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
I don't think

1213
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
That

1214
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:01,439
To use this is like a general like

1215
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,511
Are Fairborn our forebears gave all of you the right

1216
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
It's about instead he is saying

1217
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,351
Are Fairborn our forebears

1218
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Why can't I say that

1219
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,239
Our ancestors

1220
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
You

1221
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
White men

1222
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,823
The right to vote

1223
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,383
Have used that

1224
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,407
To become

1225
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Raiders

1226
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
You race traitors

1227
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,879
You were given the right to vote you weren't you weren't subjugation of the king anymore

1228
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:35,743
And then you turned that and used it to remove white peoples headphones

1229
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
Post

1230
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,839
Well that's the most likely

1231
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,239
I want the right to vote over the course of history

1232
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,031
Which is first of all time

1233
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Xbox 4

1234
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,663
And were beaten and killed

1235
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
In the process

1236
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,479
Get those bright

1237
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
Right

1238
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,575
I need Mike literally think that everybody was allowed to vote

1239
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,111
He might

1240
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:06,207
He does believe in a lure

1241
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,047
But if you go that ain't saying is

1242
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
So let's say

1243
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,375
You blacks and women

1244
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
You were given the right to vote

1245
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,447
And how dare you

1246
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
Vote in ways that are in your best

1247
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,799
So even that doesn't

1248
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,103
Well because if that is

1249
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,663
Shockingly white supremacy

1250
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,967
Supremacist it's a non-zero-sum game

1251
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,271
Zero Sum game

1252
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,367
If you if you are if you vote for what's in your best interest

1253
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,463
Truly that mean that you're not voting for what's in my best

1254
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,535
And if your voting against

1255
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,375
Pinterest then you're abusing me with the right I gave you

1256
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:49,471
You should be voting in my best interest as a as a an active

1257
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Great

1258
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,871
In order to make sure that I continue giving you good things

1259
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,503
It all it all doesn't make sense

1260
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
Like from

1261
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,855
Sensible

1262
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,439
You look at it through the prism of

1263
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,975
Rambling

1264
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,255
Bigot

1265
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,887
This next clip is from the Kavanaugh

1266
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
Stream

1267
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,191
It's one of the other thing

1268
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
The entire

1269
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
16 election

1270
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:29,407
He has to present this idea that the left is

1271
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,455
Out of control and they're rioting

1272
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,247
This is a narrative that he needs

1273
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
For very specific

1274
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
Civic reason which

1275
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,575
Wolfie in the clip

1276
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
Right after

1277
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,135
B place of safety

1278
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
He's making all of it up

1279
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
Here we are just

1280
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:46,047
25 minutes ago they confirm Kavanaugh and Alaska

1281
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,167
We have live feeds on infowars.com

1282
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
Cuz you just insane

1283
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,263
This is

1284
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Total

1285
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:04,991
SodaStream that he's playing from infowars.com in Millie and all them out on the street

1286
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,551
Show liberals

1287
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,391
Unless people standing with signs and chanting

1288
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:19,327
Or too freely congregate or any of those things come out

1289
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Cuz you lose

1290
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,375
I think I hope

1291
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,447
God I hope not in the Supreme Court

1292
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Alex

1293
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,031
People on the right are very desperately

1294
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,823
Have been for a long time

1295
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,639
The idea of all the liberal protest

1296
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
Are completely out of

1297
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
Control

1298
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,063
Recently wanted Trump rallies he was talking about how he left

1299
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,087
And Democrats

1300
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,623
To become ungovernable

1301
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,415
It's the rule of the mob and all day

1302
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,231
This is that language coming in

1303
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,511
Its final form

1304
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,071
Alex is the Alex is one of the first

1305
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,351
People who was

1306
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,911
Really going out there and pushing it real hard

1307
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
Has been

1308
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
For a very long time

1309
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,007
I have the function of it

1310
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Is 2

1311
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Now

1312
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
Try to delegitimize

1313
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,871
An entire

1314
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,919
Side of the debate

1315
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
And it's working

1316
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,783
There is no other side there's only good meal.

1317
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
Sure

1318
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,439
Sure you mean there's another side what you think you have a good point

1319
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
Evil doesn't have good points

1320
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,607
Good only has good points

1321
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,983
I mean sure they're ripe

1322
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,615
That's that dab dab

1323
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,455
I don't want to hear that that makes white people feel bad

1324
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,527
Evil things

1325
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,063
Tell me why

1326
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
Suck

1327
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,879
This is going to be dangerous

1328
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
And hopefully

1329
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:54,303
It's already too far

1330
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,863
The president of the United States going to

1331
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
Some weird

1332
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,727
Unnecessary cult-of-personality rally

1333
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
And

1334
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
Delegitimize

1335
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,567
Entire opposition party at

1336
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,103
Ungovernable

1337
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
You have now entered into

1338
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Like

1339
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,455
This is

1340
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,015
This is what history warns us about

1341
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,295
This is

1342
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,599
Don't know it

1343
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:25,279
Telling me tap for MS

1344
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,815
Open people do this

1345
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:33,215
Bad things happen that doesn't sound right

1346
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:39,615
You are the same posts along the way and that's all I'm saying

1347
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,895
Is that

1348
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
Hitler did give you the right to vote

1349
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,063
Wait no he didn't did he

1350
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,599
I'm not sure no

1351
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,391
Play my history

1352
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:00,351
The reason that this rhetoric is really important and the reason that Alex

1353
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,191
Reddit

1354
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:08,287
Send the world the first or the only

1355
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,335
But he was one of the very strong voices

1356
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
Is there any leads

1357
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
And in this clip

1358
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,967
From

1359
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,247
His head was feeling

1360
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,807
On the night of the 2016 election

1361
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,879
We're here where that rhetoric is intended to go

1362
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,695
And we'll go on stopping them forever

1363
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Because

1364
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,839
Big jackass Cruise

1365
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:37,983
They take some nice man or woman who just a hard-working good person and they think we're webs because

1366
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,519
We don't want to break their neck

1367
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,871
And so they attack us and pestilence into things until

1368
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,919
We finally stand up against some of the

1369
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,991
They they fight us we decide to break their legs

1370
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,855
Python movie

1371
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,415
Don't keep saying I'm the night to Gosney

1372
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:00,255
Continue coming

1373
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
You realize that

1374
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,607
You just can't give these people

1375
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Court

1376
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
Won't be happy

1377
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,215
Metaphysically

1378
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,287
Stomp

1379
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
So

1380
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,639
We understand you can't tell exist with us

1381
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
Because we're altruistic

1382
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
What's wrong

1383
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
We don't want to hurt you

1384
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,159
You want to hurt people like a little Tasmanian Devil piranha

1385
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,463
And show

1386
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,303
We're just going to stop here at it

1387
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,351
And kiss you on the deck

1388
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,655
And it's no hard feelings

1389
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,239
But it has to be done

1390
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:48,639
You can go around and find Radical Muslims you can find abortions all day you can

1391
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,711
You can be a weapon lie about what you really did

1392
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,247
But we're going to man up to

1393
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,807
And the final equation

1394
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,367
You belong the ashibah ministry

1395
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,719
No one wants to be around you or with

1396
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,303
No pleasure

1397
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,119
But you tried the better

1398
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,263
You may have shot Humanity in the chest

1399
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,567
Willie Nelson

1400
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
What was Merle Haggard

1401
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
Was Johnny Cash

1402
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,455
You'll never get the best

1403
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
Supremely ugly

1404
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
Do you know what that reminds

1405
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
And in the Sandman

1406
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,071
There is

1407
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,375
Storyline

1408
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
Where

1409
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,959
This woman goes

1410
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,751
Accidentally goes to

1411
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
Convention

1412
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
For serial killers

1413
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,359
And all the serial killers

1414
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,663
Irr living under this

1415
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,223
Delusion that they are there the hunters there

1416
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
Inhumanity stronger

1417
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
They're the good guys

1418
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
They're there for a reason

1419
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
And at the end of it

1420
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,879
Morpheus shows up

1421
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
And he gives

1422
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,183
The greatest curse

1423
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:05,951
In history

1424
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,999
Which is he just shows them he just

1425
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,535
Shows them who they really are

1426
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,327
Like they see themselves

1427
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,607
As they really are

1428
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
And

1429
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,399
Everyone like

1430
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
That is what

1431
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Alex

1432
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,775
Like I'm waiting for Republicans to outlaw

1433
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,079
Like what Alex

1434
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
Actually do it

1435
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,199
Like all of the things that you just described

1436
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:31,807
That they are

1437
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,111
You hate us cuz we are altruistic

1438
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,927
All of this stuff is like

1439
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,951
Coexist

1440
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,999
Weakness for altruistic

1441
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
Exactly

1442
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:47,423
Like please like if he if he was forced by some Twilight

1443
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,495
Himself

1444
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:56,895
Like that's that's the only way to truly punished Alex on the road to

1445
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:06,111
Because what are you staying in there is all this like

1446
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,183
You keep saying

1447
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,975
And the only examples

1448
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:15,327
Can come up with are you fund radical Islam and you fund abortions

1449
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,167
Abortion thing I don't even give a s*** about like that

1450
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
You know Alex

1451
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:27,359
I know I know where you are on that

1452
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,151
What is radical and what is not

1453
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,711
He's afraid of every single Muslim that exist

1454
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:36,575
Covid-19 you support Muslims and you

1455
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,903
Support women's right to get Healthcare

1456
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
That

1457
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,743
What pissing on you is

1458
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,863
You can't coexist with that's what requires you to

1459
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,679
Stop someone's skull

1460
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,983
That makes perfect sense to me

1461
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Like

1462
01:15:55,775 --> 01:16:00,639
I don't even know how to put it into words but it's one of the most pathetic tragic

1463
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,431
Things that come out of his mouth

1464
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,015
Specifically you have this idea of like

1465
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Talking about

1466
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,623
Actual rose

1467
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,463
Look when it's just people having rights fathers

1468
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
Rhetoric

1469
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
So

1470
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,143
Uncomfortable

1471
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,447
Because I I

1472
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,775
I don't know how to deal with

1473
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
The

1474
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Truth of it

1475
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
Because the truth of what he

1476
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
You saying is this

1477
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,455
No matter how hard

1478
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,015
No matter how hard we try and

1479
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:38,783
Stomp on these

1480
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
Whether we were move their arms and legs

1481
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,623
They will keep,

1482
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,695
So the only way to stop them from coming

1483
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
Is 2 killed

1484
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,535
That's how we end up with it

1485
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,815
Exactly

1486
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,007
How do you defeat

1487
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Nothing

1488
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,615
Like what what if we what do you do

1489
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,175
Like how do we do that like a Beyond

1490
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,063
Metaphorical mirror that shows them for who they really are

1491
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,599
Like how do we stop

1492
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,903
Because look we had a good run

1493
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,231
Tons of liberal policies

1494
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,047
F****** keep coming

1495
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,119
I think in the aftermath of World War II was

1496
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
Denazification efforts

1497
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,007
In the same way that after

1498
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,031
Apartheid

1499
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:35,615
There was a Reconciliation committee

1500
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,687
I don't know you need something fairly

1501
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
In terms of

1502
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,991
Levels of understanding

1503
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:44,319
And something that would be very uncomfortable for everyone to go through

1504
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,367
But it probably would be the only way

1505
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
To do it without

1506
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
Without

1507
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
You know is

1508
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,743
This career option which is

1509
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,023
Is people actually hurting me

1510
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
Yeah I mean

1511
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:59,423
8834 all voted for all of the things that I say like

1512
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,983
When it when it comes down to

1513
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,311
The people who most embody the things that I hate

1514
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,895
Are my family

1515
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,943
You know like I don't want

1516
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,807
I don't want them because I'm not on their team

1517
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,647
You know like that's gone

1518
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,975
How do we how do we

1519
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,279
Cuz changing their mind sure didn't work

1520
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,583
Or doesn't work or isn't working

1521
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:30,143
No communication

1522
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,167
Weird

1523
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
Where ungovernable

1524
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,983
Demons

1525
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,263
We're evil

1526
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,311
For doing all of this stuff

1527
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:42,431
We're slandering a good man Dan where we're tearing him down

1528
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,991
How can you trust

1529
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,783
People who want witches dance

1530
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,111
How can you communicate how can you talk to these people

1531
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,695
Saying it to them

1532
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,071
So what are we f****** do

1533
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,143
How do we do how do we do it

1534
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,727
I'm not certain people who have their minds

1535
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:09,311
Made up about the top or under the sway of very powerful propaganda

1536
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,639
Would be able to get outside of it without

1537
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,407
Some moment

1538
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
That really weather

1539
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
Some sort of metaphysical mirror

1540
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,551
Able to see the real

1541
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,367
Some sort of world event

1542
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:27,231
Realize

1543
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,279
Yeah that's really what I was apart of

1544
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
I thought it was something

1545
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,167
Because there's a very small fraction of the people who

1546
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
Are on the right

1547
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,983
Who actually

1548
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
Support

1549
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
Noxious

1550
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:43,103
Mentality

1551
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,151
I have fallen under the sway of

1552
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,687
The illusion of populism

1553
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,503
The idea of what they're going along with

1554
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
There is

1555
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:58,975
Something that would open their eyes I don't know what it would be

1556
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,863
Not just one story

1557
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:09,727
Multiples of children

1558
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,263
Children under the age of

1559
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,080
Shouldn't that have been a Flashpoint

1560
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,688
Was saved by Kevin Automotive

1561
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,528
In any situation the only reason my family got out of

1562
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,576
Was because they killed a kid

1563
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
Right

1564
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:34,304
And you would think that a Nazi rally where a guy murders a woman that would be a Flashpoint

1565
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,072
Nope

1566
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,120
If the inertia of this movement

1567
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,912
Continues along this line of

1568
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,752
Cruelty and it's only accelerated it's only getting stronger

1569
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,288
They're not losing people

1570
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,152
You know people aren't Jumping Ship aside from a couple a****** columnist

1571
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,736
You don't like

1572
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,600
Reaction

1573
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:02,976
That's going to break that inertia is only going to become stronger

1574
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:06,048
There is only going to need to be stronger

1575
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,448
What's going to stop this

1576
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
Is not going to be

1577
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,008
Be good for anybody

1578
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,664
I mean what's what's going to stop that. Well obviously the way they were going what's going to stop this is climate change

1579
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,712
Radical displays of love

1580
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
Caring and

1581
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,760
Possibly

1582
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
He could have

1583
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
The very strong

1584
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
Ensure

1585
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,928
Yeah I see what you're saying

1586
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,976
Maybe maybe I'm idealistic

1587
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,048
Maybe I don't know but I also think that you know

1588
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
Look at the history of

1589
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,864
Being attempted

1590
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,656
Generally speaking it's not so much

1591
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,216
How much do radical empathy in Lovitz

1592
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,240
Expressing radical

1593
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
Kicked out of them

1594
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,360
The Jesus

1595
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,944
We're talking about somebody's going to have to

1596
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,504
F****** take one in the chin for us

1597
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,296
Like that kind of

1598
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:02,624
Situation

1599
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,024
Well on the right imagine that the second coming is around the corner so maybe something like

1600
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:15,936
Some artificial version of the second-coming could fix things

1601
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,984
I need to steam

1602
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,776
You really are and I don't know

1603
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,544
What can

1604
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,408
Yeah but I think that's one of the problems

1605
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,968
For us fixing everything is

1606
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
Something that we do

1607
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,528
Touchdown a little bit

1608
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
Over the course of these

1609
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
That we do

1610
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,160
Alex Jones

1611
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,440
People like him

1612
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
Especially

1613
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,024
Propaganda

1614
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
They speak

1615
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
2

1616
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,096
Whether it's a

1617
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,680
Intentionally difficult to figure out but I feel like it is

1618
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
They sneaked

1619
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,264
To get rid of the Avenues by which

1620
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,056
People can have that waking up

1621
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:59,456
Try and limit access to outside world information

1622
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,504
Like the internet that could disprove them

1623
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,088
News Network

1624
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,392
One of the Prime

1625
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,952
Focuses of people who are

1626
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
Play

1627
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,096
Discredit the idea that

1628
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,656
Anything in the media being a cure

1629
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,240
Tucker Carlson

1630
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,776
And Dulce

1631
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,384
Trumpets f****** true don't worry about it

1632
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,944
Those things really

1633
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,504
Limit the ability of people to save

1634
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,272
Give themselves

1635
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:37,344
And it also hurts ability to view to talk anybody

1636
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,160
Use primary sources

1637
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,208
Chinese people

1638
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,768
On property

1639
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,048
Did a lot of State

1640
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,072
Oh hey

1641
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:52,448
You can bring those things

1642
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,216
I believe that

1643
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
It's just it's just believe

1644
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,824
So I don't know I don't know

1645
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,848
All I'm going for

1646
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,896
Is I want you and I

1647
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
Big enough

1648
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,480
Where

1649
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,504
We get invited

1650
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
One of those

1651
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,856
Haha because here's my dream Center

1652
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,672
Alright I don't want to do it

1653
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
You like my bow ties

1654
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
I love you

1655
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,584
Just wanted to bring you here so I can

1656
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,656
Insult your shity beard all I want

1657
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,192
To go on Fox News

1658
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
To do is just

1659
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:32,896
Damn

1660
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
And

1661
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,456
I just want to say this

1662
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,272
You're a giant piece of s***

1663
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,576
Thank you for having me on I'm going to get out of here

1664
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
I'm going to get out of here

1665
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,160
Nod

1666
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,720
Booyah

1667
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:53,376
I just want that moment I want one mocha Carlton cries what I'm saying

1668
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:59,776
Video camera

1669
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,824
I need a live show

1670
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,920
Some friends

1671
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:09,248
I'm sure, I have to really stretch it out

1672
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:18,976
Control for a minute

1673
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,768
Control for a minute then

1674
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:27,424
Well maybe you'll be able to overcome their delay and get a message to go fuc yourself

1675
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,520
Afterworlds

1676
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:38,432
I have to say I don't think that would be the flashpoint

1677
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,456
There is some sort of

1678
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,480
Flashpoint possible

1679
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,040
Do you think about

1680
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,320
You know that would be the

1681
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,344
Real world version

1682
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,160
The metaphorical mirror

1683
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,720
Or something like that

1684
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,536
What you would think

1685
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,864
Climate change deniers

1686
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,216
All of the hurricane getting hit with another hurricane right now

1687
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,664
12 years left

1688
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,064
Those alarmist of always buffet in Superchick

1689
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,392
100 otherwise

1690
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:25,792
I just want to try and get carbon taxes going

1691
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,888
Is it not over it finally comes home and

1692
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,240
F****** swabs of the coastline are just gone

1693
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,288
I think that's so much as

1694
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
Can be like

1695
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
I think even though

1696
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
Weather weapons

1697
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,200
Canada

1698
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:43,968
There's always

1699
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,736
There's always

1700
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,624
Exactly what I hoped to achieve with this episode

1701
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,416
I noticed

1702
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
Those Stark parallels but

1703
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,720
Between

1704
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,024
The Kavanagh stream and the election

1705
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Stream

1706
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,840
Hangout

1707
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,608
I don't know

1708
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,704
Whether it's worthwhile or not

1709
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,264
There was that cruelty in the Kavanaugh stream

1710
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,056
Did I really felt it was important

1711
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,104
Time for us to discuss even if

1712
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,688
We didn't go over the entire screen

1713
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Trista

1714
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:19,808
There wasn't all that much outside of the cruelty that was worthwhile

1715
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:24,416
Alex just Rambles about a drawing of a lighthouse that he made for about 5

1716
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,208
Define but

1717
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,768
The things I do

1718
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,048
The parallel

1719
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,840
That you have made and I think

1720
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,400
The one thing about it though

1721
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,448
Strangely hopeful

1722
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,008
What the parallel that you've made

1723
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,032
On Election night

1724
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,568
We are

1725
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,384
Crying we are all

1726
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
Watching the Doom of America

1727
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,784
Cavanaugh's inaugurated on Kavanaugh's confirmation

1728
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,576
There was no crime

1729
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,856
There is none of that

1730
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,880
Everyone

1731
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
Was ready

1732
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,232
Everyone was raising their fists up everybody whip

1733
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,000
Staying

1734
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:03,840
Not this time we're not crying mournful situation

1735
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,376
This is a fight

1736
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,984
The would-be victims of Alex's propaganda patch

1737
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,544
Put on

1738
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,616
Lady Vols

1739
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,152
And we're getting more Act

1740
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,992
Where is the glimpse of Alex as a propaganda Outlet

1741
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
Head not evolve

1742
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:25,600
He was trying to do the exact same thing

1743
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:31,232
That is slightly optimistic Democratic National Committee

1744
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,000
Every

1745
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:35,840
Even now people are like I don't know if we should run Warren

1746
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,632
She's too angry

1747
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,728
She's too shrill for the Democratic voters

1748
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:47,360
This is to say that times are ugly ahead

1749
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:55,296
Let's do let's do Clinton in 2020

1750
01:28:55,808 --> 01:29:01,952
What do building in there

1751
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,888
I don't know

1752
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:13,472
To sum up other than to say I mean everybody knows where we stand on

1753
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
Yep

1754
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:22,432
RIT website knowledge where else could you find a trailer where at

1755
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:28,832
What about another social media like

1756
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:32,928
Smaller social media

1757
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,512
What if you went to iTunes and

1758
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:42,400
Very nice that would be great any of those things would be great

1759
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,960
On Kavanaugh

1760
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,288
Call Kevin Alden.

1761
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:51,360
And we saw Alex very similar

1762
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:56,736
Between those two days

1763
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,808
Holding

1764
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:05,440
Alexandra Thurston color
