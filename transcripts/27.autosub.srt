Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,728
Everybody walk

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,152
Another episode

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,968
We're couple dudes you like to sit down have a good time

5
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
What's the address

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
I live

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
That we drink a lot of wine

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,184
Just a reasonable model

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
Reason

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
It is a reasonable

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,072
And I don't know

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
Goddamn

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
But you're quickly

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,984
And I appreciate it

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,360
If only I were the Eddie Bravo

16
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Dumbly going through this What a Wonderful World

17
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,808
If you are sensitive

18
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Please turn off this podcast

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,368
I love your smile

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
Warnings about

21
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,560
Today we're going to be discussing an episode where Alex Jones is disgraceful

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,912
Abuse to children

23
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
I don't want to do this episode

24
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Jordan alright well guys thank you very much for listening to the first 5 minutes

25
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Are you really

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
Arthur episode

27
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
We've talked about this

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
We've texted

29
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Discuss this

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
I sincerely don't

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,608
Like I don't want to do this but I think we have to

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Yeah

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
Clear that if this is

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
To be your

35
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
True Crusade against Ali

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
Eventually we're going to have to dive

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Into the Heart of

38
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
Friend in the interest of actually covering if I were I would

39
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
I'd be derelict in my duty

40
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
And it just so happened that on Friday

41
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
March 31st

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
Alex Jones in an episode that I think is one of the most

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
Disgraceful things that are

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
I posit

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
That this

46
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Is where Alex Jones

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
His propagandizing

48
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
And

49
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Being a bad person

50
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Entirely new level

51
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Somehow I find that hard to believe

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,760
I will get into

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Tell all I know

54
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
All I know is what it is

55
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
And I feel like that's more than enough to go to

56
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,768
All of my my reasoning why

57
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
The case I will

58
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Establish my premise

59
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
I will give a few more warnings

60
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
But first what I want to do is play

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Out of context

62
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
With

63
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
What we're going

64
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Oh my God

65
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
In the White House

66
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
Call me Alex Jones

67
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
What is the Texan doing

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:14,816
The President says what is the Texan up to

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
Nearly at Macado's are in the background

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
Which store or they refuse to speak

71
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
F****** horrible

72
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,696
Emojis for Leanne Macado's

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,512
Alex

74
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
Just sit there

75
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Watching her

76
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
The tiny little piece

77
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
It's not nearly as shocked as I would like

78
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
Get to be I would like her to be more offended by the things

79
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Unfortunately

80
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Think she's in

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
Operator

82
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,200
Clarification that I'd like to say is a boilerplate before we do this episode

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
You wrote it down

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
I did because I want to make sure

85
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
I've got to have

86
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
This word for word appropriate

87
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
I just want to make sure that I'm clear

88
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Here we go all right

89
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Reading

90
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
In no way

91
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Do we seek to minimize the

92
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
The seriousness of abuse against children

93
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799
Nor are we in any way impugning the important work that law enforcement agencies

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Please do to fight against

95
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
We acknowledge that pedophilia is real

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
A very serious problem

97
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,759
Any answers about the bigger picture Quest

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Regarding

99
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
It is ours

100
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Vallarta

101
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
I mean me

102
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Did Alex Jones

103
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
A documented propagandist in Liar

104
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
This is

105
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Dan Alex Jones is a documented propaganda

106
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,079
In this episode his behavior is not above board and his actions absolutely serve

107
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
The cause of

108
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Protecting children

109
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
My contention Jordan

110
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,991
I'm going to be laying out over the course of this episode

111
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
Alright is it Alex Jones

112
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
Intentionally put on a p

113
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Piece of stage

114
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Propaganda

115
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Eddie used it audience is understandable discussed

116
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
About pedophiles to exploit

117
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
I believe

118
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
What is motivation

119
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
R34

120
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
1

121
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
He wanted to say

122
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Ever everyone in the world

123
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
A publication

124
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
And on the internet and

125
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
In Social conversations

126
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,871
Made fun of him for desperately trying to avoid a lawsuit over his coverage of pizza guy

127
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
He wanted to sell more of his products

128
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
Cuz I think he's going through an economic downturn

129
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Cuz he's broke

130
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
3

131
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,111
Finally he wanted to perpetuate the myth that Donald Trump is

132
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
Is working behind the scene

133
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Against the pedophile

134
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
He's doing this

135
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Because

136
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Is that mrs. accepted

137
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
It follows from that position

138
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
That a pedophile Network actually does

139
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Exist

140
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
Yeah if it does exist

141
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
1st and Donald Trump

142
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
Well you'll forgive a whole hell of a lot because somebody is got to stop

143
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Please God damn

144
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
Right in that third point

145
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Is

146
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
All of our enemies are.

147
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:21,951
I mean look can't be bogged down in small potatoes

148
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Of trans rights

149
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
Isn't coming back

150
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
We are fighting literal demons

151
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
That's

152
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
Negotiate with them

153
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Do anything other than

154
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
Kill them no quarter

155
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Yep

156
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
It is a war

157
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
I don't know if you think

158
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
That my Claymore make intention

159
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Is 2

160
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
What do you think just hearing that laid out what do you

161
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
I think I'm only going to refer to him

162
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,951
Is labeled

163
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
Code name of the

164
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
You know what I can't allow that

165
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Pretty cool

166
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
Not really I think I hate

167
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
Quarterback

168
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
I would have to do a voice in

169
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
Riffing around the DL

170
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Protopic

171
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
Are going like

172
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:27,231
Am I even necessary for this

173
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,631
No I'm horrible stuff

174
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
So if you're worried that we're going to be playing

175
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Clips of Alex

176
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
Really just like a pig in mud

177
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Rolling around in the

178
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
The filthiness that he believes is going on I cut out most of that stuff

179
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
Not going to be grass

180
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
My contention

181
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
Will be borne out over a series of clips

182
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
More than enough already

183
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
If you feel the need that

184
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
You want to make sure that you can bury him in

185
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
In his own goddamn self

186
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
You can go find him rolling around in that

187
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,775
Really

188
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
Jose hard at Muslims

189
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
Claiming that they are mostly responsible for sexual violence

190
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Extraneous part three tries to bring in

191
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
How abortion

192
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Is part of it too and like celebrating

193
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
The killing of children

194
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Is what abortion is about

195
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Are we not

196
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
A lot of complete nonsense

197
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
To try and streamline mypoints

198
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
That I believe this is all theater

199
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
And I think

200
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
She knew it

201
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
From the beginning of the show

202
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
To wear the show on

203
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Soyuz

204
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
This is pre-written

205
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Yes and it's 44

206
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
I think more likely than pre-plan

207
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Hehehe

208
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
He had a belief

209
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,559
The things would go the way they do and that's what he was hoping for

210
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Okay cuz he could exploit it

211
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Alright I know we're speaking to vaguely and I apologize

212
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
Okay so basically

213
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
Victory of Friday's episode

214
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
Is that he has a guy on the show name

215
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
Craig Szymanski

216
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Alright well I'm already out

217
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
He's a former Navy SEAL

218
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
Red flags

219
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
What is gas

220
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
There's not the like

221
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Weird

222
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Horrible

223
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Track that I can find

224
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
It seems like he might have his heart in the right place

225
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Okay

226
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
She is coming on to promote

227
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
A new website

228
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
But he has started

229
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
And a new initiative

230
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
Call Vets for child rescue.org

231
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Sounds like a very positive thing

232
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,487
Going by the name I can assume that at the end of your very next.

233
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
I will fully support

234
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
This website

235
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
Listen

236
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Answer there is yet

237
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,727
How things play out is what this episode is all about

238
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
But for now

239
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
Sorry but for now let's just get to the first clip

240
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,199
And this one Alex talks about how evil the forces that are against

241
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
And then on top of that he gets

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
2

243
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Some facts videos

244
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,671
And so it's like eagles coming out of the nest is coming out of the cave

245
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,399
All the answers before these people but

246
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
We're dealing with very very very very Wicked people

247
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,335
What's 18

248
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Alleged pedophiles

249
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
With the kids in cages

250
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,783
California

251
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,695
28 kids

252
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,559
Nothing about the kid.

253
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,399
Thousands of times over the years

254
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
And so this is the real currency the global so I don't know

255
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
Watch

256
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,503
People

257
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
You can't

258
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
You can put all those

259
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,463
Together eseverri can't say that b******* and then

260
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Just throw on

261
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,303
And then Democrats

262
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Fat people

263
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
Everybody who doesn't believe in Jesus Muslims everybody everybody who supports

264
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
What's the ACLU

265
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
You can because he

266
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
He believes that all of this is all package

267
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Kidstogether

268
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
And that

269
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:06,527
You know I mean we've been over this a little bit and he does David later the children are the currency of the global

270
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,343
Yeah and what do you mean by that is that they prayed

271
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Child slaves around

272
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,231
And that's the way that they gain favors with each other

273
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
Absolutely how do you know what when the value stock market for that like what

274
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,007
Reality Intuit

275
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,847
I want to know what's the what's the Chinese dollar

276
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
What's the youngest a child

277
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
I really want to know

278
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Didn't read this KTLA article

279
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
That is what I think

280
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
You shouldn't

281
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Damn

282
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
I have read this

283
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
And many more

284
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
And many many more

285
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
And his main theme

286
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,519
About the world as it is is the Trump is rolling up the pedophile

287
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Thousand

288
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Why where did that come

289
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
The number I cannot substantiate

290
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,295
Anyway he's given the green light

291
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Is what Alex says

292
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
He's told these agent

293
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Being held back by Obama

294
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
Cuz he doesn't want to

295
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
6th grade 2N

296
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
Do you know he was holding the back

297
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Right

298
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,471
Them off the chain and that's why there are so many arrests

299
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Now

300
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,335
This Theory and narrative is incredibly

301
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Full of s***

302
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Explain why

303
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Before I do

304
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,247
I'm not in any way again

305
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,575
Impugning the law enforcement officers who are doing good work

306
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
My operating

307
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Stuffy

308
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Alex Jones is talking

309
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Bulshit

310
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Yeah

311
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
To make fun of Alex Jones

312
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
At reality

313
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
So

314
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Let me read my

315
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
And wipe myself off anyways

316
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
The article starts

317
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Hundreds of people were arrested in

318
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
Dozens of sexually exploited children adults

319
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,375
We're rescued across California during a Statewide operation

320
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Trafficking

321
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,983
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department

322
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
So that starts out with

323
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
It does say dozens of sexually exploit

324
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Children

325
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,247
There's no indication of kids in bondage there's no

326
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Discussion of cages

327
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
None of that information is there

328
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,159
As best I can tell cuz I Googled it I looked into this as deeply as I could

329
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
There is no stories anywhere currently

330
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
About kids in cage

331
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,071
There are a couple stories from last few years

332
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Massive

333
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
Child abuse stories

334
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
Kid being saved from abusive parents

335
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,799
Those are the only stories I can find that involve cages

336
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
That's not to say that that's not

337
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Horrifying

338
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
But it's not what Alex is talking

339
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,711
It's at the very least

340
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
Here's where Alex gets in trouble

341
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
The second paragraph

342
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Alright

343
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
More than 30 federal state and local law enforcement

344
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
And please

345
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Including the Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking task force

346
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
Participated

347
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
Third annual

348
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Operation reclaim and rebuild

349
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
Enforcement operation according to the Sheriff's

350
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
It's the third annual one

351
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
So nothing to do with Trump

352
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
It's like a marathon

353
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Yes

354
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
Flight to Boston

355
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Yeah

356
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
And you know why they do it every year

357
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Also because

358
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Barack Obama started it

359
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Oh boy

360
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
This is business Apartments

361
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
I

362
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
Entirely agree good idea

363
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
I mean this was because of Obama

364
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
In 2010

365
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Former President Barack Obama did

366
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,127
Declared January National slavery

367
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Right

368
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Barack Obama started that

369
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
When were these boss

370
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Well

371
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
He sold

372
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
When were the bus

373
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
They were at the end of January

374
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
They were the culmination

375
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,743
Of human trafficking a national slavery prevention

376
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,375
They were the ceremonial end-of-the-month that Barack Obama was allegedly

377
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
Soft on human trafficking

378
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Created

379
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Well

380
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Also

381
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,735
A little dump

382
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
Statistic for Alex Jones

383
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
The chew on for a little while

384
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Is b u s human trafficking arrests

385
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Getting an all-time high

386
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
In 2016

387
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
Under Barack Obama

388
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
Well it's because law enforcement

389
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
Was coming

390
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Cuz because they do Trump

391
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Let the

392
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Proverbial

393
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
The Baha Men

394
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
Have finally got there

395
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Gallo

396
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
I don't know that much

397
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,879
That's all I remember.

398
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
How do I

399
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
How do I know

400
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Said something to do with

401
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
The national human trafficking Awareness Month

402
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
The Barack Obama Started in

403
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
2010

404
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
We got a couple of reason

405
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
That just timing matched up and I'm like

406
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
No I read the press release

407
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
Explicitly layout but the three-day operation at the end of January

408
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
In conjunction with human trafficking Awareness Month

409
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:09,279
Yeah so that entire narrative about Trump being responsible for all this stuff is really busted

410
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,887
It's made up in order to once again take credit for Obama's action

411
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Because we can't

412
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Great

413
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
Sing about Trump for all the Republicans

414
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
Pretend

415
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
The Trump is responsible for all the good things that they

416
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Couldn't allow

417
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Obama

418
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,063
Look at how the economy

419
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Well we can't

420
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,439
We can't admit that Obama took us from a terrible place to where we are

421
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
Look at all the good ship

422
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,351
Obama was a good president

423
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
And they really like and respect

424
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,543
Camp in their brains are connected

425
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
It's not because of racism

426
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,503
Still around

427
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
We got rid of

428
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,599
People were arrested

429
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
47

430
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
If it stings

431
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
Operation

432
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
California

433
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
Which of the massive star

434
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
Hello

435
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
I meant a lot of people

436
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
The result

437
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
I mean

438
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,847
You would expect to say worst thing in the entire State you like a couple thousand

439
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
Yeah

440
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
The reality is 28 children

441
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Who were sexually exploited

442
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Were saved

443
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,855
And that's awesome that is the thing I want to make very clear

444
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
Is that legally speaking

445
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,695
A child is anyone under age

446
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,791
Yep so Alex's whole thing about this being five-year-olds

447
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
In cages and s*** like that

448
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
That's not necessarily true

449
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
We don't really have that information

450
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
It could be just a larger part of

451
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
The fact that there's still a lot of women

452
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,175
Hurricane going on

453
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
18 year old woman

454
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
Right or 17 year-old woman with a sexually exploited child

455
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,743
But I will say that it's very different in the mind

456
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
Like what you picture

457
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
If it's

458
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
Elementary kid

459
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
A runaway team

460
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Yeah

461
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Neither were good

462
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
But they're very different

463
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
There

464
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,615
Now

465
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Oh my God

466
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
10 year old your f****** monster

467
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
It's it's

468
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
I like it's not good but it is lesson

469
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Like

470
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,487
Almost grown

471
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
I mean part of that is because

472
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
Is the word you have to recognize that there are tragic realities in our world

473
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,799
Goddamn terrible home system

474
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:05,151
They might run away from home or they might just be homeless

475
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Might get into drugs

476
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
That could lead

477
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,807
A sixteen-year-old of their own volition

478
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
To end up in prostitution

479
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
And get arrested Flash

480
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,159
Save-A-Lot

481
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
Percentage

482
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
Minority that winds up

483
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Yeah

484
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Alex don't give a f*** about that

485
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,104
It sure would be nice

486
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Unfortunately

487
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Of course

488
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
California situation

489
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,368
Pedophile Network literally everything Trump has ever done

490
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,488
Let's not get into that because

491
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
This

492
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Statement

493
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
From

494
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
The sheriff press release

495
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Investigators focused

496
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Enforcement operations wherever

497
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
King of human beings

498
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Took place

499
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,336
From confronting the reality of sidewalk prostitution

500
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
By conducting Johnston

501
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,736
The challenging is right next to conduct

502
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,064
The challenging the virtual reality of the cyber world

503
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
We're tractors believe they can operate anonymously using the internet

504
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,488
The experience of specialty trained

505
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,840
Who posed as an interacted with suspect on social media

506
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
I threw that tractors and customers were anxious to exploit

507
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Found their plans foiled

508
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
So a lot of this

509
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
Prevent

510
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Sure

511
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Yeah there were some

512
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Children

513
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Adults who ended up being

514
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,344
Even adults need help is there in a pimp situation

515
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
Maybe we should protect them as well instead of considering them criminals and forcing them to work in an unregulated

516
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,608
Industry

517
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
That is a larger point

518
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
That I want to make also is that

519
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
A great number of these arrests

520
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Prostitution

521
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Yes

522
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
There

523
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
Some of them

524
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Illegal

525
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
More illegal immigrants

526
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Some of it is

527
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
Not just because I want to minimize if it

528
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Somebody

529
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
To Catch a Predator

530
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,768
Yeah and that's not stuff that you do

531
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
And there's a fake victim involved

532
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah so you didn't save anybody

533
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
You just got a guy

534
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
We're just

535
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
But it's not what I want to talk

536
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
Who's this case

537
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Really doesn't work

538
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
The service Point clip 1

539
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:53,088
Write a pile of garbage

540
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
Create

541
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
Beer

542
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
In people of something that

543
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Isn't what we're talk

544
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:03,328
Haley misleading on the packet

545
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,472
He also says that we don't know what's going on with these children legal for you to know

546
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,568
It would be illegal to report on what's going on with these miners

547
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Without their consent

548
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
Without them by coming out

549
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
I'm talkin about it

550
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,296
Well that's one of the things that is so difficult Elizabeth Smart until she came out

551
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,416
Well if you're if you are a journalist who is trying to expose

552
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
You can't

553
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,024
It's against the law to be a part of it for many reasons you can

554
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
But also

555
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Alex

556
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
Images even stupider because

557
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Is the next paragraph in

558
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
The sheriff press release

559
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Meijer in Canton

560
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,128
Personnel from various Department of Children Family Service Agency

561
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
What's going on

562
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,016
That's really good family services

563
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,416
Recycled back into the pedophile Network they were places

564
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
At the very least

565
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,792
Abolish slavery

566
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,912
Coordinated Emergency Services response

567
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Service organization

568
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
We have a little bit of information

569
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,104
Now now you shouldn't give us all the information because those people

570
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,944
Definitely don't

571
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,528
Deserve Alex Jones on this b******* and f******

572
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Once again putting

573
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Victims

574
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,232
Exactly why there is

575
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Misperception that Trump is

576
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
Getting all of these pedophile arrest

577
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
Going cuz I have no idea

578
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
People are publicizing

579
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Mostly

580
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
Uno's

581
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Sex workers

582
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
And they're claiming that

583
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
They're about things that they are

584
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
So I found a massive list

585
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
That someone had posted

586
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Of all of these bus

587
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
What happened since Trump took office

588
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
And I went through all of them

589
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
And almost none of them are reasonable

590
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
Almost none of them are

591
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
What Alex is talking about

592
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
They aren't pedophile ring

593
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Again

594
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
There's a story here from Memphis

595
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
A lot of these cases

596
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Law

597
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
When is not the hero

598
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't know

599
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
What do you mean

600
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
I mean

601
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Again a lot of

602
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Helping

603
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,648
Not necessarily they're not good I'll make your point for you

604
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
This case in Memphis

605
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,816
Memphis operation led by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation

606
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
Thirty-eight men and four women were arrested on prostitution related charges

607
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
Hayden's Post for ads on Backpage

608
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
For about 17 hours a day for 3 days

609
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
People in

610
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,920
And some ass undercover agents posed as a juvenile girl

611
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,736
Eight men responded in page have underage female

612
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
To those specifically paid money to have sex

613
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
The fourteen-year-old girl

614
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
These people are creepy

615
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
But there's a fake victim

616
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Involved

617
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
So you're not saving anybody

618
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Except

619
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Hypothetical future victims

620
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,168
Which is good it is good but the problem with a lot of things like this is those charges aren't going to stick

621
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Thoroughly

622
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
If you look at that this article list

623
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
All of the charges

624
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,360
And most of them are patronizing

625
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Esthetician near a church

626
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
School

627
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Which is

628
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:37,344
Not a not a big offense

629
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
Anytime there was another charge

630
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,792
They worked the patronizing prostitutes and they were charged with

631
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
For instance

632
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
This guy

633
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,168
Charged with possession of cocaine heroin and oxycodone

634
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Or this guy charged with

635
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
Having marijuana and cocaine

636
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
Actual charges are charged with prostitution one

637
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,272
Just turning into one of those like broken windows policing

638
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:11,136
Where is like you just do whatever bulshit you can to try and get any charges on peep

639
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,512
I will say it's good in the case of things like

640
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
It's good but

641
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,424
It's not doing the effective

642
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
I'm not sure

643
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
I don't think we have the answer

644
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
I just have the answers to why Alex Jones

645
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
The f****** liar

646
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,688
Are you saying two comedians living in Chicago don't have all the answers

647
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
4

648
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
Complicated

649
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
Procedure

650
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,648
Southeast

651
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Pose a massive sting

652
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,536
It was around the Superbowl

653
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
Happens every year

654
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
It's notorious

655
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,728
Every single because people go

656
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:04,128
Come into the place and then they're all these people are rushed into

657
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:09,248
Cons of prostitution that goes on around

658
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
It's

659
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,904
Are just like they're just going to if they're not put in jail there

660
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
I'm just going to go back home

661
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,864
Human trafficking victims

662
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,424
Updating

663
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,520
On its latest operation during press conference Wednesday February 1st

664
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,616
Operation at the end of January week

665
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,944
Human trafficking Awareness Month

666
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,344
Operation violent crime against children

667
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,184
The victims ranged in age from their early twenties to late 40s

668
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
So none of these people were killed

669
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Good

670
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
If they need help

671
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Good on you to give it to him

672
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
I'm not taking that away

673
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
But it is not what I want to talk

674
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
This is an octopus another article

675
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
About

676
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
More people

677
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
That's all this is

678
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Almost

679
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
Temporary Transit

680
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Yeah

681
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,904
So it doesn't actually do anything to address the larger or deeper issue

682
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
Richmond Virginia

683
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,584
This isn't exactly the same thing it was another online operator

684
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,496
It's just

685
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:39,616
I've gone through and look through it and I found almost no evidence that any of these

686
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Legitimately

687
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Possibly

688
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Connected to

689
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
What would be a child traffic

690
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Even worse than that post links to all of these stories

691
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
No it seems like all of these things are

692
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,376
Really more just to generate

693
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Publicity

694
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Cuz it is

695
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
To coincide with

696
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
And then

697
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,992
The darker side of it too is that there are probably Quotev

698
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,552
Another

699
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,648
Human trafficking Awareness Month

700
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,976
The thing that you've got to bring in

701
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,608
So I think there's some of that but I mean eight if you are legitimately helping people

702
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
I'm not I'm not upset about the motivation

703
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
In for it if it is to get

704
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Statistics

705
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
I'm very

706
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
I'm a little

707
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Some people who don't deserve

708
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
Yeah but at the end

709
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
I don't know

710
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
How do I look

711
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
Is Alex

712
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,488
You just made the intro for almost all these photos just going to be Alex

713
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,008
Yeah I want us to shut up about what's going on

714
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
Nope no you

715
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
What's going on

716
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
Thousands of girls

717
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,376
What's happened

718
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,216
Orthodox radical Islam pedophilia

719
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
Networks

720
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,616
So I forgot I did actually leave in a little bit of that

721
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
You

722
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Questions

723
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,832
Yeah he's doing that

724
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Well I'm just I'm just ask

725
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Question

726
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,488
Why are people be doing things and you're like well

727
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
Well they they aren't

728
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,400
Why were they doing

729
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,960
Explanation

730
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
No

731
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Do they do it

732
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,640
I would I would like to

733
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Just

734
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
Get to the bottom of a couple of

735
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
First of all we can

736
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,576
Dismiss the idea that

737
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Love is in the Quran

738
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
No it's not

739
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
There are a lot of

740
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,488
Children that end up getting married to adult

741
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
And that's because

742
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
It's an ancient book

743
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
There are traditions

744
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Go back

745
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
Even in

746
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
That have to do with

747
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,896
The time

748
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
And

749
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,272
It turns out a lot of history is filled with all dudes

750
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,832
Some of the western civilization has

751
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
Admittedly

752
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Cuz you died

753
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,256
Yeah and a lot of these stories that are coming out about

754
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
Muslim rape gangs and stuff like that is

755
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
I've found no basis in reality

756
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,704
Looked into it baby not as deeply

757
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
Is

758
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,664
Suspiciously only on Breitbart and Infowars

759
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,968
At what rate games I am the most

760
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,552
Where Evan concerned about

761
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
Sorry

762
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,280
The number one thing that

763
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Is

764
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Is the

765
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Most

766
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Is that

767
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,776
Christianity spread

768
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
To the point where

769
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,872
They demonized Gabe

770
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
People

771
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,736
Very much

772
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
And those rape gangs go around raping lesbian women

773
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
In order to

774
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Turn them straight

775
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,440
Yeah

776
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Not

777
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
And I'm not even to save that say

778
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Christian

779
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Sanity

780
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,936
That is a perversion of everything that

781
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,984
Humanity should be I agree

782
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
I agree

783
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
Ghetto cowboy

784
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Do you win

785
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,968
Pedophilia to be a respected Orion

786
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
To make sure that if

787
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Man

788
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Comes to your house

789
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,952
Hey I want to take your five-year-old on a date

790
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
You can't

00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,376
But the only evidence that I can find

792
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
That

793
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Facts

794
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:59,360
Is it in 1993 the international lesbian and gay Association of Chief United Nations

795
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Consultative status

796
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
Nablus membership

797
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
Neil GA Drew heavy criticism

798
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,064
And caused the suspension of the eye gilga

799
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
From the you

800
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,392
Oh okay

801
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
Explicitly not

802
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,072
International

803
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
Association

804
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Back in 1993

805
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
Covid-19 94

806
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
The ilga Expelled

807
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Continue f****** looked at him

808
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
Yeah it look

809
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
Yeah

810
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
You say that

811
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,992
The UN is trying to pass

812
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Agenda

813
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
Under 21

814
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,416
Yeah dilg a still was unable to get their status back

815
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
2000

816
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,816
They weren't able to get their consultative status back

817
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
United Nations

818
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,472
This is caused a really interesting

819
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
Sort of fight

820
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Between

821
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
NAMBLA and

822
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,384
There can't be an intern

823
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,320
Human Rights Campaign

824
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,696
Organization

825
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
Words to insinuate

826
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
The pedophilia is an issue related

827
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
The gay and lesbian civil rights

828
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
I agree

829
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
NAMBLA says

830
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,192
Man-boy love is by definition

831
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
The Western homosexual tradition

832
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,544
From Socrates to Wild to get

833
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,848
Many non-western homosexuality

834
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,152
From New Guinea to Persia to Zulu the Japanese

835
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
We're for bipedal

836
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
Man-boy lovers are part of

837
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
The gay movement

838
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
History and culture

839
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,048
Most recent like here's

840
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
Most recent reference

841
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,400
For what I'm doing is okay

842
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Is Greek

843
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
2300 years ago

844
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,336
Yeah maybe maybe you guys are wrong

845
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:12,480
What the representative goes on to say homosexual to be attracted to adolescent boys

846
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,784
Or just as ludicrous as heterosexual saying it

847
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
It's not heterosexual to be attract

848
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
The adolescent girls

849
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,672
I don't know bro

850
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Stretch

851
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Right

852
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
Man you got to do

853
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,096
Complicated math

854
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,704
Yes this person is of the same sexy retracted

855
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Me and that it

856
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,032
Part of the natural sexuality

857
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
I don't think we need to unpack.

858
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
And

859
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,344
Nah

860
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,952
This International Association was kicked

861
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
Yeah because of because of Nampa

862
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,912
Anybody else

863
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,984
Right and then all the sudden

864
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:12,640
Like here's the thing

865
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,016
Yeah which is why we should the federal government

866
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
That is not

867
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
That it is not a

868
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,024
Gay or lesbian or straight

869
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
Sexual orientation

870
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
What it is

871
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Is you want to f******

872
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,400
Right there's no

873
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,008
There's no I have a gender preference

874
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
There's

875
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
Tire

876
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
I have a kid prep

877
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,640
It seems to be more in Port

878
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
Yeah anyway

879
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
Why is that

880
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
Salon

881
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
Pedophilia is okay

882
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:58,208
This is based on a series of articles

883
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
In 2015

884
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,376
He was a guy who came out of the closet

885
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,424
Pedophile

886
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,264
Who wrote These articles

887
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Say art

888
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
Supporting pedophiles

889
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,224
So she won't even the most right-wing of people even they are like well hold on this isn't really

890
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,296
This isn't what these crazy right-wingers say

891
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
Here here's just a little bit of

892
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
His

893
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
His article

894
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
My name is Todd Nickerson and I'm a pedophile

895
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
Does that surprise you

896
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
Yeah they're willing to share our stories

897
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
For good reason

898
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
The children's delay claims

899
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
The most reviled status on the planet

900
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,192
1 p.m.

901
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Any chance you have of living a normal life

902
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Yes I'm not the monster you think

903
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
I've never touched a child sexually in my life and I never will

904
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
Nor do I use c****************

905
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,968
But isn't that the definition of a pedophile

906
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,992
Someone who molest

907
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Children

908
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Not really

909
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,112
Although pedophile and child molester have been used interchangeably in the media

910
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,464
A pedophile is someone who sexually attracted to children

911
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
That's it

912
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,560
There's no inherent reason you must act on those desires with real children

913
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,120
Sometimes

914
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Because the powerful taboo Keeps Us

915
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Hiding

916
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,496
Is it possible to know how many non-offending pedophiles are out there

917
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
Besides

918
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
And too often we suffer in silence

919
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
That's why I decided

920
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Speak out

921
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
He goes on

922
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
To call it

923
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
The highest order

924
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
And a massive

925
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,624
It is hard to have sympathy

926
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Right

927
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
But

928
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
I think that I do

929
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
I'm in the same way I

930
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
This is a false equivalency

931
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
But I was really into diaper

932
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Sure like that's gross

933
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,312
It's got to be tough to do that with you

934
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,407
Most play files

935
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
Are not practicing

936
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
They've never touched

937
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:02,879
We're getting it we're getting into consent

938
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
I appreciate it

939
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
This article

940
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,423
Really leave you with necessarily sympathy

941
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
And it's not supposed

942
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
What it's supposed to

943
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
Express is that

944
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
There are people

945
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
Who didn't make this choice

946
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,687
Being attracted to Children isn't a choice of

947
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
These people have made

948
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
It's a horrible curse

949
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,807
Facebook when they were younger

950
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Something

951
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Danos

952
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,231
He knows exactly what it comes from

953
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
The guy with a brain tumor came in all the sudden he's at

954
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Did the children

955
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Take it out

956
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
It's

957
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
Is that attraction

958
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
Is gone

959
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Children

960
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Emojis

961
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
Weird dumb

962
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
Monster survive

963
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
And I'm the only thing

964
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
But is it all

965
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
Is it the guys making an argument that

966
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:08,415
Not everyone acts on these things there's a lot of people who have these feelings who understand

967
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,999
But they can never act on it and it's a horrible person or trying to

968
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
To get help with it

969
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,583
Maybe one of the reasons I can't get help

970
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Because if

971
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
They come out and say

972
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
Pretty much they're going to jail for murder

973
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:25,823
Yeah and I understand the reaction that people have to them too I get it I get all sides

974
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,711
Crazy but the thing is that this article is this article is interesting and

975
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,759
Thought-provoking more than it is

976
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
Looking for

977
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,879
Yeah but we know that Alex Jones doesn't know how to read

978
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,207
He reads this and he's like kind of files okay

979
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
And that's not what the article is

980
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
So in that one clip

981
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
We have three in

982
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Edible live

983
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
All-in-one

984
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
He's really crushing

985
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,751
So far we have not even gotten

986
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,567
So now we get to

987
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
We get to

988
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
This man

989
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
Greg Solomon Sawyer

990
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
Here Comes Alexander.

991
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,879
Tell us about your idea

992
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
Currently

993
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:19,839
I can doing raise all the world

994
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,143
Make Spotify some patriots

995
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,823
That's illegal

996
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,383
Hey we're not going to talk about these

997
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,247
Horrible Vigilantes operating outside of the law with very little oversight

998
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,855
Probably going extrajudicial in

999
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Yeah

1000
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,183
We're big fans of lynching

1001
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
Yeah I mean

1002
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
That the net really gets to the heart of why a lot of ism

1003
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
The problem with Alex

1004
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Is doing

1005
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,399
Operating outside of

1006
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Any Authority

1007
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,495
And that's really dangerous

1008
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,311
Part of the of the law and this is

1009
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,103
The most

1010
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Addition of

1011
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,199
Everybody deserves

1012
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Affair.

1013
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Defense

1014
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
That is there

1015
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
Text the bad guys

1016
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
It's

1017
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
To protect us from going

1018
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
Far-right

1019
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
If you

1020
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
Absolutely

1021
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
Because he said it

1022
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
He said if I catch somebody

1023
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
Touching my daughter

1024
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
I'm going to kill them

1025
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Right

1026
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
That's your

1027
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
Pizza stinks

1028
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,615
And that's one of the things that we see so often from

1029
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,687
Electing judges in electing

1030
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
Attorneys in all that stuff to be prosecutors

1031
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Is

1032
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
We are elect

1033
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
Them because we want them to

1034
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
To punish

1035
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
As hard as they can

1036
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
And that is the most

1037
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Damage

1038
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
The people that are being

1039
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
Punished

1040
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Don't have it

1041
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,119
Will like baby Dory minimums

1042
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,983
Susan drug offense

1043
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,567
F****** the murderer are pale

1044
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,711
Terrific deserving of the death penalty are payout

1045
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
In f******

1046
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
What boxes

1047
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
Years before they were even charged

1048
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
Yeah that is

1049
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
That is why we don't

1050
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
That's why we have those laws there

1051
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
And

1052
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,119
Are also good reasons to not have

1053
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
Vigilantism

1054
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,959
If you're going to get the wrong people

1055
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
Are you sure

1056
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
Yeah

1057
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:40,383
Issues

1058
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
We still mythologize this guy's a hero in there so many times

1059
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,975
Oh man I beat up the wrong guy anyways moving on that guy's going to have to shoot out of a tube for the rest of his life

1060
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
Walter White

1061
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,071
Here's a is not a clip

1062
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,863
Introducing the song

1063
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
Intro

1064
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
I should also add

1065
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,103
He said he's going to pause a lot.

1066
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,663
Oh no we're going to get interrupted

1067
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,271
Enforcement officer

1068
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,391
Positive unfortunate time he was saying that in addition to being a Marine

1069
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
Saw man was also

1070
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,791
A federal investigator and I've done some research into his

1071
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
I read a biography

1072
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
There was also an interview

1073
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,983
On a website

1074
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
It mentioned no

1075
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
Law enforcement

1076
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,871
His career

1077
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
How many times have

1078
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,431
These guys come on

1079
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Turns out

1080
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
None of what they say is

1081
00:47:54,623 --> 00:48:00,767
Okay we have documented evidence wasn't making it up

1082
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
For five years

1083
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,679
Colby from Survivor

1084
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
The Host

1085
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
But he was

1086
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Gun

1087
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
Expert or whatever on there

1088
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
He's a Navy Seal Seal trainer

1089
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
He's

1090
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:26,623
Listen to app. But Alex's laundry list of other credit

1091
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Is not

1092
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
Anything I can backup he's never been investigator

1093
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Well you have now

1094
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,823
Federal law enforcement

1095
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,431
You have also obviously in the CIA Navy Seals everything you've been in all of it

1096
00:48:54,015 --> 00:49:00,159
3000 + reported pedophiles arrested and it goes totally dark

1097
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,207
Shows total proof the total control

1098
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Sunlight is

1099
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
The best antiseptic for corruption

1100
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
I agree and that's why

1101
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
To Alex Jones claims

1102
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:24,735
Give me a vet in sensationalizing the idea that it's all these people have been arrested or supposed

1103
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
The pedophiles

1104
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,063
That's not the case

1105
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
Have adult prostitute

1106
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,183
The idea that you sensationalizing it with kids

1107
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,255
Some cages and all this s*** is just

1108
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Again it

1109
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,559
It's propaganda

1110
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,911
What's the right term for it is exploitation of fear

1111
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
Sure it is at 2

1112
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,359
So he's going to get into why Craig is on the show now in this next

1113
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,407
Clip and this brings us to act

1114
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
2

1115
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,015
Act one was the setup of his premise the Trump

1116
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
Doing all this stuff

1117
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,599
Wiping out pedophile network switch

1118
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
I think

1119
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,207
Based on all the evidence

1120
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,535
So according to traditional screenwriting rules

1121
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,095
We've introduced the characters in

1122
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
To get into the

1123
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Yeah

1124
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
So here is

1125
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,495
What you doing here

1126
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:27,455
Virtually every

1127
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:33,087
Theron

1128
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,719
With this and it's really all about her for our organization

1129
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:48,191
Organization

1130
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
Walkthrough

1131
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,223
It's a pedophile

1132
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
That fill your head

1133
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
We're just crazy

1134
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:24,799
Oh maybe it was in that minute-and-a-half long expletive rant that Alex did on our last episode

1135
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
I don't know what that mean

1136
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,223
I don't know either but she was fighting

1137
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,575
Is it like a as a like a

1138
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:40,415
Help

1139
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,863
Okay what's your point of Jordan

1140
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,727
Stop bring that up is that this

1141
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
Was Friday

1142
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
March 31st

1143
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
That night when he was drunk on air

1144
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
For 2 hours

1145
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
Was March 30th

1146
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
This is the next day

1147
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,527
And I

1148
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Believe

1149
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
But at this point in the show

1150
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,367
Alex is sober

1151
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Maybe hungover

1152
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
But by the end of this

1153
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,535
Know how many hours

1154
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:24,447
Houston because of how this radio drama

1155
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,495
Does radiodrama ends up

1156
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
Necessitating

1157
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
I'm staying around

1158
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,591
I think he did his time

1159
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,663
And then had to get back on air

1160
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
That's my theory

1161
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,295
Okay sounds very different at the end of this

1162
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
He sounds like

1163
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
Last episode

1164
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,439
Where where unraveling

1165
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
Right either way

1166
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,023
He did that embarrassing f******

1167
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Learn

1168
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,143
Oh yeah little learn Rob do

1169
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:57,471
He did that the night before that

1170
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
Down

1171
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Down

1172
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Left right

1173
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:05,407
Within 24 hours

1174
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,967
Calling Adam Schiff c*********

1175
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,271
Screaming he wants to fight him

1176
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
Losing his s***

1177
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:19,231
Do a duet with the architect

1178
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,583
Let's finish out this clip

1179
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,423
Keep in mind this is within the same 24 hours

1180
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:31,007
Todoroki

1181
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,615
It's by the end of this episode how dry I am

1182
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:42,527
Alex

1183
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,975
Recreational feel like I have

1184
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,327
The ability to make a positive difference

1185
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:10,687
Since then

1186
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,135
Search for child rescue.org

1187
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
And Just Dance

1188
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,959
We got a pedophile Network in control Beckley the NSA

1189
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,543
Crazy

1190
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
He is going to do

1191
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
So much

1192
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,895
And his heart

1193
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:47,807
Search in the right place probably

1194
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,671
Respect

1195
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,719
You know he's doing what he can with what he has

1196
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
Jordan Spieth

1197
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
Into early

1198
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,303
Oh God damn

1199
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,167
It seems like that might be the case but you're speaking far too early

1200
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:10,335
Is Pedigree a little bit

1201
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,895
You know how he learned

1202
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:17,503
That the media is always going to lie that the media is the only

1203
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
Boyd the mediator

1204
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Scare

1205
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,647
Basically

1206
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:28,255
Is a puff interview for the most part and then we get to this part

1207
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
Where Alex predict

1208
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,351
So you would say that Alex Jones

1209
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
Is acting like a narc

1210
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
Archetypal

1211
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,263
I wouldn't put those words your hand

1212
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,687
So this next clip is where Alex

1213
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
Go-kart switch Alex

1214
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,111
It talks about how everything you do about pedophilia gets

1215
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
And that is important

1216
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
Keep in mind

1217
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,591
And the police

1218
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,919
Meanwhile

1219
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,967
We try to share that on Facebook

1220
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
So this is important

1221
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
Because this

1222
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,623
Is Alex giving up the game

1223
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
I believe

1224
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
I believe that this is Alex

1225
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,255
Sort of showing his hand but he knows

1226
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
What's going to happen in act 3

1227
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
Spoiler

1228
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,399
Also I want to say that are you

1229
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:42,751
Are you, down home country lawyer Matlock b******* right

1230
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,479
Cuz I like to take a moment to say that the only thing that I support

1231
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
On this episode

1232
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
Is it coming back from break

1233
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
One of a Time

1234
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Alex Jones

1235
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,623
Came in from break

1236
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
Silent Running

1237
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,463
Play Mike and the mechanics

1238
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,583
That's a banger that's a good song

1239
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
But

1240
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,911
I realized you know that song

1241
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
No

1242
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
Is a great song

1243
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,151
I'm not I'm not disagreeing with you because I'm assuming that

1244
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
Your

1245
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,967
About to play

1246
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,807
I'm going to play a little bit of it just it's fresh in your mind

1247
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,831
I think it's important

1248
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:33,183
I swear to God this is

1249
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Is actually rella

1250
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
Okay

1251
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
Feel like it is but I promise

1252
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,631
So after cut through the you like

1253
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:48,031
52nd introduction

1254
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:54,431
Does every 80s movie in one song this is Top Gun this is

1255
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Days of Thunder

1256
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,759
Basically this is Tom Cruise

1257
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,039
But the reason

1258
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
I love that I love that since

1259
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,903
The reason I wanted to play it is I realized

1260
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,975
This is the most Alex Jones song in the f****** world

1261
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Okay

1262
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,631
Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar

1263
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:20,287
Now the fighting will close it will be close at hand don't believe what the church and state and everything they tell you

1264
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Believe me I'm with

1265
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
The high command

1266
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:24,895
Whoa

1267
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:29,503
There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway

1268
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,551
Use it only in emergency

1269
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
Better you should pray to God

1270
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:38,719
Are you bothering the spirit will guide you and protect from

1271
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
Mike and the mechanics

1272
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,631
Came to life

1273
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,471
I know I'm tapped into reality as Alex

1274
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,543
I'm saying that I came back from break

1275
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
To Mike and the mechanics

1276
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,127
Silent Running almost as a tip of the Hat

1277
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:01,247
Almost like a I get it I get it I think it's a little clue

1278
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,343
For those who like in a really look into it

1279
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,159
It's probably just that Alex

1280
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,439
I love this song

1281
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
Swear allegiance to the

1282
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,535
The flag whatever I like they offer

1283
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,839
Never hinted what you really feel

1284
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
Teach the children quietly

1285
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,447
For some days Sons and Daughters will rise up in

1286
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:25,567
Fight where we stay still

1287
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
What is happening

1288
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,687
Silent Running

1289
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,783
Because we need some sort of like

1290
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
Fun and amusement

1291
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,903
So anyways that song is pretty hot I recommended

1292
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,975
So we now get to

1293
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,023
At this point in the show

1294
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,047
You might be wondering

1295
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,583
What is going on

1296
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
He has this

1297
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
His

1298
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
He's launching

1299
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,471
Yes he is also launching

1300
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
A fundraiser

1301
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,543
Youcaring.com

1302
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,591
Okay in order to raise the money for it

1303
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,127
And they get into the specifics here

1304
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,175
The website is

1305
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,551
Cinema World chart of the word

1306
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,599
Child rescue.org

1307
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,879
For the number 4

1308
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,927
Call rescue.org

1309
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:19,327
There's a way to donate for starting a nonprofit organization

1310
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
At The Gatekeepers

1311
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:29,823
Yeah but we can get all the bureaucratic red tape

1312
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,687
Interruption

1313
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,903
Donations I know you guys are for real

1314
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,095
That poor child rescue.org

1315
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,191
He's doing this fundraising

1316
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,239
Campaign that they

1317
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,031
Youcaring.com

1318
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
Think

1319
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,895
To create a documentary

1320
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
About this

1321
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
Riches

1322
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,759
Legally problematic

1323
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Because

1324
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
It massively approach

1325
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Is defamation

1326
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
Oh wait

1327
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:27,935
So they're making a documentary web series about specific people did I mess up Network

1328
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,775
How would you do that without going after the people

1329
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,103
He's talking about going and documenting and going

1330
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,895
Buster Network

1331
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:42,271
Well yeah but he doesn't mention it doesn't mention Alex Jones specific level

1332
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
Pedophile Network

1333
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:48,927
I would not be on the show I didn't

1334
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,743
Does go after them

1335
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
That's not what

1336
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,863
Of course not but I know you're right you're right now

1337
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
Pause Alex Jones

1338
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,167
Actually Donuts

1339
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,471
Well

1340
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,287
Enough

1341
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,127
But

1342
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,431
No look there are pedophiles

1343
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,223
Communities online online

1344
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,503
The dark web

1345
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,791
You know you want to try and work with that

1346
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,703
Goodonya

1347
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:38,335
I'm at work again

1348
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,455
Globalist

1349
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,783
Is where there's a problem

1350
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,599
If you go and you end up trying to

1351
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:54,719
Make a documentary Series where you're going after these people inevitably they are

1352
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,535
The crime when you are going after them

1353
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,095
And if you're going after them knowing they're not going to

1354
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
Charged with a

1355
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,703
You're probably going to take justice into your own

1356
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Do go around

1357
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,639
And you document something

1358
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
You find

1359
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,943
Is it someone has committed a crime

1360
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,503
Now your evidence is inadmissible in court

1361
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,855
Yep so there's no you're doing more harm than good by vigilante

1362
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:27,231
There's a legitimately no upside to this outside of exploiting the fear

1363
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,767
Exploiting

1364
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
That's the only

1365
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351
Real game

1366
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,191
Documented all of the evidence that's being cited

1367
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
This KTLA story

1368
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:44,127
Number of proper Boston

1369
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
So

1370
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:48,223
I have to believe that they're motivated by profit

1371
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
Beds

1372
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,855
I still can't believe this Navy SEAL guys

1373
01:03:55,391 --> 01:04:00,767
If it's possible and I can totally understand why he wouldn't understand all of it

1374
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:05,631
If your Navy SEAL it's not exactly like you're used to worrying about

1375
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Search and seizure laws

1376
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:15,359
Yeah like that's not really a thing that you have to be concerned with whatever you're committing those exact crime

1377
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,431
You should be you should be concerned if it based on Alex's fake

1378
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:25,599
Curriculum everyone everyone who

1379
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:28,415
Whatever it is

1380
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,719
I like what you're doing out

1381
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,887
Good on you Alex civil forfeiture

1382
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:44,287
Bobbitt all this stuff is going on all this terrible stuff and then he lies about

1383
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
I really like

1384
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
That show your watch

1385
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,383
Oh yeah never watching the game

1386
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
Hey

1387
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:01,695
And you see the proof about Trump on a few issues like this Healthcare thing not being

1388
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,279
Obamacare was better than nothing

1389
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,959
And I just have every week I'm literally like 100 article

1390
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:33,951
But that also that article on Townhall is where I got some of the references

1391
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,999
Is that I discussed earlier

1392
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:41,631
Garbage

1393
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:47,775
What's the local news

1394
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,359
Things that are

1395
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
It's it's

1396
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,271
It's infuriating because this isn't funny and it's such a serious issue

1397
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
It seems to me

1398
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,623
Like I hate I hate this

1399
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
Average intimately hate

1400
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,487
Not what I was doing but the weird

1401
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Anyway

1402
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,863
There's no

1403
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:19,519
In the middle I'm not I'm just I just hope there's no evidence

1404
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:23,103
In any of these articles that their legislators or judges being

1405
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,127
Caught up in this

1406
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,943
There was one legislator who recently got caught

1407
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,015
The seventeen-year-old boy in a hotel room

1408
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,855
Party

1409
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Look

1410
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Scump

1411
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:52,031
The guy in the hotel room

1412
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,055
Do you process

1413
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,759
It's not good but it isn't as bad as kidnapping children

1414
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,087
That is not it's so essential

1415
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
It's it's

1416
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,903
Anyone here

1417
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:20,703
Obviously

1418
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,007
Delaney's

1419
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
If that's the case

1420
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
That's illegal

1421
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,127
Yep the military is not allowed to do operation

1422
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,687
Uso oil

1423
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,063
Especially not bonforte

1424
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,623
Operation separation

1425
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,415
And it's scary that the police

1426
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
Becoming so militarized

1427
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,023
Yep goes deeper with Ally

1428
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,383
His narrative essay that he's spinning isn't there these

1429
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Compound

1430
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,455
That are being infiltrated

1431
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,991
With military might

1432
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
In our country

1433
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,807
That are housing

1434
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
Child pornographers

1435
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,879
And torture dance

1436
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
And stuff like that

1437
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:15,999
Military

1438
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,071
I met everyone on this

1439
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,191
Who is your source is lying

1440
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,727
That's why

1441
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,007
This isn't going on

1442
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
Yep there aren't

1443
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,615
Military scale battles going on

1444
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,479
Because it's not possible

1445
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,039
I would say it is possible but

1446
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,903
Hopefully we still have some

1447
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
We still have some

1448
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
Vivid

1449
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:51,071
The instances of high-profile people who have been

1450
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
Caught up in

1451
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,399
Are numerous

1452
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
And it's big news

1453
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,727
It's all over the place

1454
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,287
Also when people are kidnapped

1455
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,871
Their stories

1456
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
People are safe

1457
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
From kidnapping

1458
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,967
Stories about

1459
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,295
We see it over and over again I guess I brought up Elizabeth Smart

1460
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
Tuesday

1461
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,183
Girls

1462
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,231
That's our in that house with that creepy dude

1463
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,511
Yep

1464
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,583
There are Dorados

1465
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:30,751
A big media topic cuz they know that people will

1466
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,079
Unless

1467
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,407
The globalist know

1468
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,199
That's the only way for this narrative to make sense

1469
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:42,015
Fortunately

1470
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:46,111
Donation

1471
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,999
I'm going to give $10,000 to this

1472
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
Right

1473
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,351
Whatever

1474
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,167
I mean it is a lot of money but

1475
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,215
You're worth over 10 million dollars

1476
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
So

1477
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
$10,000 is

1478
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,663
All the months

1479
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,319
How this is supposed to work

1480
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
And like

1481
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:20,159
Why can't we do it through proper channels

1482
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,207
It sure seems like

1483
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:27,327
Independent

1484
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:34,239
Circumvent

1485
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
Also if you try to do it

1486
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:42,175
If you're just a reason we can't do

1487
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,039
If you're doing this

1488
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,391
Without the

1489
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,767
Breast involvement of law enforcement

1490
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
That's why it's okay

1491
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,911
Bristol Police Department

1492
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:06,751
For you exactly what they're saying is being covered up

1493
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Yeah

1494
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:17,247
Put Chris Hansen

1495
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,551
Big is the

1496
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,087
That just b*******

1497
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,647
Joe the mainstream media is

1498
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:28,511
Distracting you that's the fake version that they want you to see not the globalist

1499
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,047
Cabal organized

1500
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,839
The oldest is organized man

1501
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
See pictures of

1502
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
You can just create your own reality

1503
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
And there's never a there's never a bottom

1504
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Floor

1505
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,823
There's no there's no argument you can

1506
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
Can make when your

1507
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,919
When you're fighting it's like fighting somebody with religion

1508
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:52,319
How do you know how do you know God is real and one of the things in the Bible is just like

1509
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,903
When you know you know you know you know you know you know

1510
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,231
Great Bible

1511
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
Alex Wright

1512
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,119
I agree it is mild

1513
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
Schizophrenia

1514
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
Inability to

1515
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,751
To deal with things that are outside of your preconceived notion

1516
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,775
It's it's

1517
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
Form of denial

1518
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:17,663
Living world that you have

1519
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
Control over of your own choosing

1520
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759

1521
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,855
That was the presentation

1522
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
The fisa

1523
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,719
The sort of scenario

1524
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,999
Is Ben Diaz

1525
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,303
Marine on

1526
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
Who wants

1527
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,607
To crowdfund

1528
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,911
Half a quarter million dollars

1529
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,959
In order to make a docu-series

1530
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,239
Where he out pedophile

1531
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
Gotcha

1532
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
Again

1533
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,567
Legal issues with that

1534
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
Whether he's doing this

1535
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,175
As law enforcement

1536
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
Or as entertainment

1537
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,015
Either way there are some dubious

1538
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Pieces of it

1539
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:58,879
We're just to go back to Catch a Predator a lot of those people flat-out

1540
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,927
Prison

1541
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
No they weren't

1542
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:06,303
TV a lot of them ended up with very minor charges

1543
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,583
Maybe even a fine

1544
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,935
What liver enzyme

1545
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,727
Yeah it was like The Running Man

1546
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,775
Sure he wants to do that

1547
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
God bless him

1548
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
There's

1549
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,847
Chosen Temple

1550
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
So

1551
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
He's got to do it with law enforcement

1552
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,343
Seems to be against

1553
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
Two pieces of

1554
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,159
Keeping it independent

1555
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,695
So your f***

1556
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,767
Here's the beginning of

1557
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
Act 3

1558
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
Now at this point

1559
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
We're about to start

1560
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,423
Into the end of the show

1561
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
Leah McAdoo is around

1562
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,239
Eventually David

1563
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,799
4000

1564
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,103
That this point Alex has ended his shift

1565
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,127
Essentially

1566
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:57,759
You might notice that sounds like she has a little booze

1567
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,559
Whatever

1568
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,607
Garage

1569
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
8/8

1570
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
Inflection at the end

1571
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,103
Is the inflection of the end goes up and gets

1572
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Borat

1573
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,223
Where's Malik

1574
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,247
I also tell

1575
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,831
I also kept a clip and because it was the infant

1576
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
Pennsylvania McAdoo going

1577
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,183
Alright

1578
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,719
But here's worth X3

1579
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
Start earnest

1580
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,791
Weather

1581
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,583
And

1582
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,423
We're spreading everywhere

1583
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,703
He's talking about the

1584
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,527
Along with our great hacking expert I got involved

1585
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,575
Michelle Taylor they made the calls

1586
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
They have the email Rochelle it

1587
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:15,839
They should you violate our terms of service up a guy with a History Channel show 5 Seasons

1588
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,191
When we are on channel 5

1589
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,223
Again if you legal

1590
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
To say

1591
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,855
Feel like

1592
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,415
The credits of the people is like

1593
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,255
There's a guy I'll from the History Channel

1594
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:50,399
Are you kidding me a guy from the Discovery Channel we know these are things that are impossible

1595
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,263
Hitler's been on

1596
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,799
I have

1597
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Spell

1598
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,615
Giorgio Tsoukalos should be invested

1599
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
And

1600
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:10,111
Touch this it's over

1601
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:16,255
We don't have $100 Starbucks

1602
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,887
Immediately

1603
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
Gets in

1604
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,799
Alright

1605
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:33,663
SimCity need to set up the exact

1606
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
Situation

1607
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:47,999
Because they are so scared

1608
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:53,631
It's in KTLA

1609
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,447
Who are the kids

1610
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,775
I'm talking to my kids are on milk boxes

1611
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,967
Based on the fact that

1612
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,991
He has

1613
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
3 lies

1614
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,087
In there I just assumed the fourth thing he says is a lie

1615
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,439
Is that is that wrong of me

1616
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:20,767
I don't know I don't know if these kids are on mailboxes

1617
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,047
I don't know

1618
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:26,911
Do it

1619
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,215
My point is I don't

1620
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:32,543
I don't know and there's literally no way to legally know who the

1621
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,847
The 28th door saved

1622
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
Los Angeles

1623
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
There's no way we should be allowed

1624
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,063
Speculative and he has no evidence

1625
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,111
Is sources have been shown to

1626
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,695
Is Alex Jones being told those things

1627
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
Can probably assume

1628
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
He's being told those thing

1629
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
By the voices

1630
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,327
Just weirdo collars or Liars

1631
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:01,983
Direct message on Twitter

1632
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543
Really plays the vicar

1633
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,303
Yamin is pretty straightforward

1634
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
Let's see what else he has to say

1635
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,359
Violation

1636
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,943
Oh you don't think so

1637
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,735
Solomon Sawyer

1638
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,511
That's not a good time

1639
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Semi clean the man

1640
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,095
Can you please

1641
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,191
I found five instances of him breaking the rules

1642
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,711
Countdown Lexa Letterman

1643
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,991
Had any

1644
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,271
Effort

1645
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,551
Justin putting in more work

1646
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,575
I would put drumroll

1647
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,927
Okay so the first one

1648
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,951
Is just from there

1649
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
Boilerplate

1650
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:34,655
Although you caring has no obligation to screen

1651
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,727
Youcaring reserves the right

Anytime

1655
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,127
If for any reason without notice

01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,943
You are solely responsible for creating backup copies

1657
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
Bababababa

1658
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,575
Already on you can refuse service to anybody

1659
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,159
Exactly like most customer service

1660
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,439
That alone

1661
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
I got no legs

1662
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:04,863
No shirt no shoes are illegal no service

1663
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,679

The way it's set up

1705
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,352
It is kind of illegal

1706
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,424
It's definitely it's definitely its

1707
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,520

01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:56,736
For that

1711
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,600
If he was an established nonprofit

1712
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,416
History

1713
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,952
He's not giving this money

1714
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
No

1715
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,256
This is a criminal thing

1716
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,584
This money and he's going to

1717
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
To use it

1718
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
2

1719
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,472
People down

1720
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,056
I feel like at no point in the movie The Dangerous

1721
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,456
Okay I'm going to need the crowd

1722
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
To hunt down people

1723
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:41,536
You agree not to post upload to transmit distribute store create or otherwise published

User content that is unlawful libelous graphic

1726
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
Indecent lewd

1727
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,984
Suggestive harassing

1728
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
Threatening

1729
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,056
Invasive of privacy or publicity right

1730
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
Abusive

1731
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,104
Inflammatory.

1732
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,408
Misleading fraudulent or otherwise objectionable

1733
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:03,040
Pretty sure he falls into a number of them

1734
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:06,880
Certainly very suggestive invasive

1735
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:13,280
Definition

1736
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,560
Yes

1737
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,352
I believe so

1738
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:20,192
Misleading hundred percent

1739
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,752
Absolutely yes

1740
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,056
Objectionable

1741
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,016
This

1742
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:36,320
What Alex Jones

1743
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,600
Cuz the law is

1744
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
Is the law

1745
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,416
Now we get down to this next

1746
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
Dissection on

1747
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
Indemnification

1748
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:47,840
You agreed to defend and hold harmless youcaring its independent contractor service

1749
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,424
And their respective directors employees in Asia

1750
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:54,752
From against any claims suits or claims

1751
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,896
Against all damages cost liabilities expensive

1752
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:05,504
Including but not limited to reasonable attorneys fees arising out of related to

1753
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,064
Any user content you post or otherwise train

1754
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,600
Northridge

1755
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
Or you

1756
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,392
The interactive area

1757
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
There's no way that they could

1758
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,208
Indemnify you carrying

1759
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,488
Out of this Witch Hunt

1760
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:17,536
New operation

1761
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,840
This is slander City

1762
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
Lawsuit City

1763
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:28,288
Because actually charged

1764
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:32,128
Actually trying to do a show like this would only work if

1765
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,456
The people who are featured on it are already convicted of a crime

1766
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,480
Yeah

1767
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,040
A release form

1768
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:42,112
Nevermind. Do that

1769
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,648
I'm not I'm not

1770
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:46,464
Trying to give legal advice

1771
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
The last one

1772
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,888
The five infractions that I believe I found in the terms of service

1773
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,704
User content

1774
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,728
Constitute

1775
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:02,848
Encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense

1776
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:08,480
Or that would otherwise great liability or violate any local State national or international law

1777
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,248
Including

1778
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,064
Without limitation the regulations of the US Securities Act

1779
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,720
Commissioner

1780
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,608
This would be very

1781
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:27,936
This this show this fundraiser is very illegal

1782
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:31,264
For those violations

1783
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,056
Do they make a big stink out of

1784
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,152
Do you know what they did

1785
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,480
They wrote that up

1786
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,552
After that probably

1787
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,856
I got you a once again

1788
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
Globalist

1789
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
Now

1790
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,696
This is why it's important

1791
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,976
That I brought

1792
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,024
Attention to the fact that earlier

1793
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:53,792
Alex

1794
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,096
Was talking about how this always

1795
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
Spencer

1796
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
He predicted

1797
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,216
Novice

1798
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,056
That's something

1799
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,360
Crystal ball

1800
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
Perhaps

1801
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
Reading the terms

1802
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
My argument

1803
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
But I'm making

1804
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,528
Set up at the beginning

1805
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Fully layout

1806
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,088
Okay is that I believe

1807
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
That they made this you

1808
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,648
Youcaring

1809
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
Get shot down

1810
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,464
Oh okay

1811
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,512
Did that

1812
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,560
A trap

1813
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,352
And that at the end

1814
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:34,752
At the end of the

1815
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,288
He's going to read those terms of service

1816
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:42,688
And they're going to tell people that don't have anything to do with that

1817
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:47,296
Even the late tomorrow

1818
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:52,160
Googling necessary to find all of that is their martyrdom is

1819
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,976
Complete and all of that is to set up this what happens

1820
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
All of it is

1821
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,536
Is just a justifiable

1822
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:00,352
So you're going to you're going to Colombo the f*** out of

1823
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,144
I believe

1824
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,960
Just one more thing

1825
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,080
They have no idea about violation

1826
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
Yes

1827
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:20,832
Your acts are a little bit but I like your I like your style

1828
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:29,536
Okay

1829
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,864
I believe that all of this is laying the groundwork for them to

1830
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,400
To be able to get into the stuff

1831
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,168
After they get into

1832
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,472
I believe that wholeheartedly

1833
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,872
I believe it they did it also to reinforce all the ideas until already presented

1834
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,432
About Trump going after pedophile Network

1835
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:50,016
Be at the fact that this guy is fundraiser

1836
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:56,416
The pedophile Network or super powerful even sensor

1837
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,024
Fake evidence manufactured

1838
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,584
It's propaganda it's stage propaganda

1839
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,912
Yeah and the only way that my brain can make sense of it is

1840
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,520
That's lucky coincidences or they knew going in yeah

1841
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,152
Tough question

1842
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,224
Because I I I believe that they have

1843
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,760
That level of cutting

1844
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,552
Or someone behind us

1845
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
Cuz Alex's pretty

1846
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,136
No Alex doesn't

1847
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,672
Alex

1848
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
Sing.

1849
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,000
Direct

1850
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,304
That ability there

1851
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,608
Being the producer

1852
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:42,496
I mean

1853
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:50,432
Rocky seems like the simple are we calling route

1854
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,760
Putting Alex Jones through the wringer for the night before

1855
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,552
Just visible that it

1856
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,368
No I believe it robbed was a True Believer and

1857
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,160
If you not be getting Alex off track

1858
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
But

1859
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,512
Let me see if I can find a way to more

1860
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,632
Crystallize my point I'm not sure I have okay

1861
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,752
So here is your main point is if I understand

1862
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,336
This is

1863
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,872
Design

1864
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,664
This is all bill

1865
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,736
Switch their narrative

1866
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:25,760
Back

1867
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,552
To him being the Martyr

1868
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
Abraham being

1869
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:39,840
The stink off of that

1870
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:44,448
I've been on this ship

1871
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,080
I made a mistake but we got

1872
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:54,944
Distracted from the main issue exactly

1873
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:01,088
This is where Alex Jones lies a bunch of

1874
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,624
More about what he did

1875
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,096
No you're not

1876
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,888
Out-and-out lies

1877
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,216
In the interest of protecting

1878
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:17,984
Defensive sentence

1879
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,776
Like the idea

1880
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:23,360
We're proud of our attraction in the entrance of a

1881
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:24,896
Reality

1882
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,664
Alex

1883
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,968
Please address the fact that you

1884
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,760
Still have not said that the

1885
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,552
The shooter in the cat back bossk

1886
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,832
Was a white dude

1887
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,880
Please address that

1888
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,440
Give us

1889
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,976
That retraction

1890
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,768
You know but you're not going to get a lawsuit for

1891
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,792
From a dude and came back

1892
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,816
Who's in prison

1893
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,096
Yep

1894
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:44,864
Okay

1895
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
Good breakfast

1896
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,472
Emails come out

1897
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,776
Aleister Crowley Stone

1898
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:58,176
Rituals

1899
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:08,160
And then there's all these peaches

1900
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,488
They say that that's your cheese pizza Shelbourne all that stuff

1901
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,024
Check pizza child born

1902
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:18,912
Well that's like internet phone

1903
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,704
Yeah you know

1904
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
That's troll internet

1905
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:30,176
That's what they do in the media awesome 4chan comments they probably constantly

1906
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,480
A pizza place

1907
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:48,096
How do you spell Claudia

1908
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,424
The flooring is coming

1909
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,496
All that is there ever

1910
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,264
And

1911
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,664
Even then

1912
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,992
Story straight but we have

1913
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:07,552
At least that one video of him

1914
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,904
It is completely contradictory

1915
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,232
A documentation of him lying in a different way than the way he's lying

1916
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,536
Right and no one is no one

1917
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,352
No one

1918
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:25,728
No one who believes the pizzagate is stupid you're stupid damaging

1919
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,264
The cause of protecting children

1920
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:34,176
I can't imagine I know that there's Atlee

1921
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,456
At least one dude who does

1922
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,760
Cuz There's 7 billion people on this

1923
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,552
But

1924
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,832
That dude

1925
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,856
Isn't it

1926
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,928
And it's not it

1927
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,744
It's again just this

1928
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,048
Miss aligning your critics

1929
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,840
Miss aligning of people who are against you

1930
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,888
One way is to say

1931
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:56,960
That everyone who were fighting monsters

1932
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,984
Keep kids in cages

1933
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,008
The other way is

1934
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,568
To say that people are arguing pedophilia

1935
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:08,224
Well as an example of a strong man but it wouldn't be

1936
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,992
Helpful

1937
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:13,856
So anyway in this next

1938
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,648
This next one

1939
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,024
This is one of my favorite thing

1940
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,560
That is

1941
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,840
Alex Jones

1942
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,144
I am

1943
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,680
This is

1944
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,240
Adjust his Showmanship coming out

1945
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:34,592
And then on top of it he started off by insinuating the Civil War is about to break

1946
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:47,136
I can feel it

1947
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:52,000
I'm feeling good

1948
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,936
I believe we're crossing

1949
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,360
Those kids are crying out to God

1950
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,384
Cliche

1951
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,456
We don't want to be

1952
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,992
It's got to be

1953
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:16,320
And so as a man

1954
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
You can see how f******

1955
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,256
Fake that is

1956
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,304
Alex Jones

1957
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,632
If you watch the video you can absolutely see how fake that is

1958
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
It's a fence

1959
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
The content of it

1960
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,520
Makes it all the worse

1961
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,384
There's not enough words for how bad I feel about the

1962
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,200
This Is Us

1963
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:48,064
Are you getting Wyatt are you getting why I have labeled it a new low

1964
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,368
Yeah for him this is absolutely

1965
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,952
This is

1966
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,488
Words fail me

1967
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:04,960
Motorcycles I don't know I have failed me as well this is unbelievable

1968
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:13,920
But we are doing so

1969
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,712
Why do blisters go by

1970
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:17,504
Water filters things you need

1971
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,904
Roblox all out there trying to Shutterfly that he's such a best-seller

1972
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,976
Yep f*** you

1973
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,000
F*** you

1974
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:31,584
CoQ10

1975
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,888
Fair enough

1976
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:43,872
I lived in a world where that didn't happen up until

1977
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,920
You make me here

1978
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:54,112
It's it's it's one of those things where you put on this show

1979
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,160
Visit 3xplay CenturyLink

1980
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:02,560
Because everything is so severe

1981
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:13,824
Yep that's exactly what the game

1982
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,664
Support him you need to donate

1983
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
Twice

1984
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
Yep

1985
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,480
That is

1986
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,504
The game that is

1987
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,784
100% the game

1988
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,832
Navigate to ralix

1989
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,368
I think

1990
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,136
That

1991
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,208
That is that low level

1992
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,000
Yep

1993
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,304
This whole thing

1994
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,840
This whole thing

1995
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:39,680
On f****** believable

1996
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,216
No this is

1997
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:41,984
This is

1998
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,520
This is

1999
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:47,104
Televangelist level

2000
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,920
You know like if your if your

2001
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:54,272
Not paying attention to what's actually going on easy to get caught up in

2002
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,576
The sensationalism of the emotion

2003
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:59,392
And if you're someone who is easily

2004
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
Influence

2005
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,976
You know

2006
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,256
I think people

2007
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:08,608
Rightfully so are very offended when they hear about children being harmed

2008
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:13,728
I think that using that is one way that you can

2009
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,336
Trigger people into not thinking rationally

2010
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,384
When you bring those sorts of fat

2011
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,664
Alex's doing that

2012
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736
Yeah it's f****** insane

2013
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,016
It is next

2014
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,040
We get to

2015
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,320
The point where Alex

2016
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:29,856
Doubles back

2017
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:32,160
On re-establishing

2018
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,952
To make it seem like this

2019
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,232
Has been a real turn of events

2020
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,280
Right so here's this

2021
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:49,312
Because thousands of bucks every month

2022
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,176
No more show scared of this

2023
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,224
Nope drunk blurry

2024
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:04,928
And he's trying to reinforce the earlier cuz everytime you bring this

2025
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,208
They don't know

2026
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:18,240
I'm not telling you the truth

2027
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:22,080
Millions of people listened to your show every week Alex theoretically

2028
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:27,200
But 1245 using his own numbers

2029
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,248
Yeah he's far more popular

2030
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,272
Craig Sawyer

2031
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,552
The salt man

2032
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:36,928
So they censor this guy but not how it doesn't make any sense

2033
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,488
Walking theater

2034
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,256
So anyway

2035
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
David Knight

2036
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:47,680
Has been silently sitting by as co-host

2037
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:54,080
Most of it out

2038
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:57,152
You do have to listen to it for a minute you but

2039
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,968
I don't think I made this clear enough

2040
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:05,856
And then they finish their call and Alex Goes

2041
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,952
And then

2042
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,720
When

2043
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,256
What the f***

2044
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,280
Don't

2045
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Where am I

2046
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:21,472
So whenever the thing

2047
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,752
Taken down

2048
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,824
They get saw man back on the phone

2049
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,360
How to get back on Skype

2050
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:30,944
So there's a break or he's not there and then they bring him back

2051
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,016
So I wanted to make sure it was clear

2052
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:36,064
The sort of narrative

2053
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,624
So he was on there and then.

2054
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,440
He was on 42 announced

2055
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,720
The fundraiser

2056
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,000
They finish the call

2057
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:48,096
There's a break of like maybe 45 minutes half an hour or so

2058
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:52,448
And it's boring so I got most of that have

2059
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,216
And they get him back

2060
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:55,520
During the show

2061
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,592
Immediately after announcing this

2062
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,872
Yeah

2063
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,408
Wow

2064
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,224
He probably got

2065
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:11,904
Why they had to have taken because there was a guy

2066
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,952
Sing it got up to like $50,000 and

2067
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:17,792
Yeah

2068
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:20,352
But still do it

2069
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,120
Is like

2070
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
Did he actually

2071
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,472
Click the buttons on air he shows his receipt on it

2072
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,776
I don't know

2073
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,056
I'm inclined to be

2074
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:40,064
And they realize

2075
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,368
Radar

2076
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:45,184
Yeah it wouldn't get up to the q18 whatever

2077
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,000
Well well either that or illegal

2078
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280
As we know it

2079
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:52,096
It's 45 million people are listening to Alex Jones

2080
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,656
I'm assuming at least one of the employees

2081
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,424
Possible

2082
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,216
Yep

2083
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,264
David Knight comes in

2084
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,056
And

2085
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:07,200
That's the sign of a man ready

2086
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
For whatever

2087
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:11,808
Well he wants to talk about abortion

2088
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
Speeding

2089
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:15,392
A sacrifice children to dark God

2090
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
Baphomet

2091
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
But

2092
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,720
Skips off that

2093
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
To make this point

2094
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,352
I'd like you to not talk

2095
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:27,168
I know I say this too much and I'm sorry

2096
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,216
You have never said that too much

2097
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:34,336
Please let the click play always been absolutely correct

2098
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:36,640
Play cuz it's horribly fence

2099
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,112
Accepted because we have do not have

2100
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:58,912
Decide that they want to be 12

2101
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:07,616
We can have the teacher you can have a psychiatrist

2102
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:12,992
If I can do that and the kid can make that determination at the early age

2103
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:23,488
California

2104
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
Yeah

2105
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:29,120
So a couple of interesting things that I would like

2106
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,424
But they are very formal

2107
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,240
In terms of psychologist

2108
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,288
And how they interact with France

2109
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:41,920
The reason is because it is a very serious thing

2110
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,712
It is a real thing

2111
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,784
Ever use the word

2112
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,576
Genderism

2113
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
In my present

2114
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,928
I'm going to feel my hand

2115
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:54,976
Garfield

2116
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,024
So it's really

2117
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,840
Is because that makes it seem like it's

2118
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,888
Some sort of plot

2119
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,472
Psychiatrist

2120
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:09,568
Sandy community-at-large swallow

2121
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,592
Standards of care

2122
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,200
Wpath standards of care

2123
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,736
Are the

2124
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,016
Generally accepted

2125
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,040
Standards

2126
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:24,160
I'm dealing with children represent with gender dysphoria

2127
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:25,952
Mattress

2128
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
On your own

2129
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,584
What are things that interesting is this first paragraph

2130
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,912
Important difference between gender dysphoric children and adolescents

2131
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:37,984
That isn't a proportion

2132
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,080
Gender dysphoria during a continuance

2133
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,872
Rather

2134
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,152
Little children

2135
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:45,920
Bailey boys

2136
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,992
Who referred to clinics for assessment

2137
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,528
The story of Perseus

2138
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,600
To 23% of

2139
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
The children

2140
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,952
Boys in these studies were more likely to identify as gay

2141
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,720
Transgender

2142
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:02,048
Newer studies including also including girls

2143
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,840
27%

2144
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
Persistence rate

2145
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,400
Gender dysphoria into adulthood

2146
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,680
In contrast

2147
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,216
The Persistence of gender

2148
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:12,032
Dysphoria into adulthood appears to be much higher for adolescents

2149
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,592
No formal prospective studies except

2150
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,152
However in a follow-up study of the Adolescent

2151
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,200
Gender dysphoria

2152
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,992
And given puberty suppressing hormones

2153
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,552
All continued with the actual sex reassignment

2154
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,368
Beginning with simonizing masculinizing hormones

2155
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,720
The percentage

2156
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,864
Adolescent adolescent

2157
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:41,984
Who had gender dysphoria

2158
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,568
No 225

2159
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:49,152
625

2160
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,944
12 to 27 in the most recent

2161
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,736
2000

2162
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:56,832
Once you got into adolescent if it persist

2163
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:59,392
They would persist on into adulthood

2164
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,440
Wow

2165
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,208
Cher

2166
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
That seems

2167
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,024
That's crazy

2168
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,840
A 100%

2169
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:16,800
Other Studies have shown that there is a strong

2170
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,080
Indication that if it is

2171
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:18,848
Persistent

2172
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Into that age

2173
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:25,248
Absolutely

2174
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:31,648
When you're younger around sexually

2175
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:36,000
And the reason that it's important not to treat people like they're weird or

2176
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,048
Because

2177
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,864
Some people grow out of phases

2178
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:44,192
And for some people it's not even

2179
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,728
Who they are

2180
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,008
When you have this

2181
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,544
12 to 27%

2182
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,872
Distance to Dalton from the age of

2183
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,664
You can't

2184
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,200
You can't be shity to that

2185
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,736
April 27th

2186
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:01,344
Psychiatrist

2187
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,672
It's your responsibility to

2188
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,696
Protect those

2189
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,720
12 to 27

2190
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,512
Percent while at the same time

2191
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,792
Acknowledging

2192
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,560
That

2193
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,376
As they get older they may

2194
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,424
And they may become

2195
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,472
Not

2196
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:22,336
Okay with who you are

2197
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:29,760
Where is

2198
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:33,344
84 2

2199
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,624
63%

2200
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,648
Of the population

2201
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
70

2202
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,440
Yeah

2203
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,000
So you have to as a therapist respect

2204
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,816
People who aren't going to age out

2205
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:46,144
And not bully the other people who

2206
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:49,472
It's a very delicate line

2207
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,408
F****** hard

2208
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,688
And then of course

2209
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:01,248
Is it where everybody knows psychiatrist to

2210
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,320
You know how many how many psychiatrists have you cycle

2211
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,856
My number

2212
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:12,512
Some socks or grab right buttons in the cancel stuff like this

2213
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,560
Clear-cut standards that are that exist

2214
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:20,960
And the idea that schools and doctors are telling them

2215
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:25,568
Years old you should be a boy when you're a girl that's exist

2216
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,592
Any response

2217
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,152
Undermine

2218
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,688
Your trust in

2219
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,712
Any of them

2220
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,808
Any school

2221
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,392
Very possibly

2222
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,696
Telling your five-year-old child

2223
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:42,976
You should be a girl

2224
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:46,048
And it's further undermined

2225
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:48,096
Everybody who has

2226
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:51,936
Non-binary or non-traditional sexual gender

2227
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:57,056
And so why would you

2228
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,872
And maybe being tricked by doctors

2229
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:00,640
Your f****** kid

2230
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,248
Do anything but yell at that

2231
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:07,552
All day everyday

2232
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
You are the

2233
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:11,648
Singapore

2234
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:15,232
And if you if you run one of those camps

2235
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,280
Again you are a criminal

2236
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:21,120
Glossed over in Thailand

2237
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,656
I feel terrible that we have

2238
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:28,032
The goddamn pedophilia

2239
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:28,800
People

2240
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:31,616
Who identify as trans

2241
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,456
Tune that out right

2242
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:37,504
That's well within character for him

2243
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,576
The drunken lieshout that not even

2244
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,344
Really

2245
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,368
Relate

2246
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,648
It's horrible

2247
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,928
White noise

2248
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:48,256
But the other thing that he doesn't understand it all as the difference

2249
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:50,816
Between sexual

2250
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
Number three

2251
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:58,752
Sexual orientation

2252
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:01,568
Which is further offence of sexual

2253
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,128
Anything like that

2254
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,152
Even

2255
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,992
We also know he can't read

2256
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,040
Makes it difficult

2257
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,368
All the stuff that I presented

2258
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:20,000
Do any of the stuff I know

2259
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,584
We did figure that one out

2260
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:28,704
Here's the wraps everything into Trump and then

2261
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,728
Really weird way

2262
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,264
Really f****** weird

2263
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,128
Right now

2264
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:41,248
Red cedar mommy in 2 years and they

2265
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,208
Is saying no and all these other people I know

2266
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,536
Human Nicki Minaj military operation

2267
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:58,656
Outside of basins in the US

2268
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:05,312
Obama is Muslim

2269
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,760
Epic time

2270
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:24,768
If absolutely not based on any reality

2271
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:28,608
Sure that's irrelevant

2272
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,656
Niacin

2273
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,472

Atq

2311
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,576
Youth in New York we're going to do something like that

2312
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,368
But I want to

2313
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,904
Just play this

2314
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,464
In case you missed the end of our last episode

2315
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,256
This was Alex

2316
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:05,536
Amir

2317
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:11,424
11 hours

2318
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:15,264
3x play about a propaganda about child abuse

2319
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,312
This is what he sounded like

2320
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:20,128
Before but

2321
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,664
Learn to experience

2322
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,712
Didn't learn through

2323
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:26,016
Education

2324
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,112
Or you can learn through

2325
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
Revelation

2326
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:33,952
Race memory

2327
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,072
Erase memory

2328
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,864
So there is always more exactly

2329
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,656
Common sense

2330
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,448
Shelly's common sense

2331
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,056
Learning

2332
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,616
Elearn

2333
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,688
Well you have education

2334
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:57,760
Like you said

2335
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:03,136
Experience

2336
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:07,744
Well it's spiritual Galaxy

2337
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,448
And you really learn by screwing up

2338
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,728
Screwing up

2339
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:21,312
The best way is to learn

2340
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,616
That's why she was quite

2341
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,944
The three ways a movie.

2342
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,480
Lake

2343
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,016
The best way to learn

2344
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:34,368
Slippery

2345
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:40,768
I want I want to play

2346
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,816
The night before for 2 hours

2347
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:45,888
He was threatening and standing up like that

2348
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:47,936
Clear parallels and similarities

2349
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,240
At that clip to the end

2350
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,008
The other club

2351
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,312
So in summation

2352
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:56,896
I believe that what we've covered here I apologize

2353
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,224
You talk about some of this stuff I really don't like covering

2354
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,272
These sort of issues

2355
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,296
Necessarily

2356
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,064
Because

2357
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,344
I worry

2358
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,136
That people could think

2359
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:09,440
Our perspective is minimizing

2360
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,464
A real world

2361
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,256
Is very

2362
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,304
That's something I really don't want to do

2363
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,840
I don't want

2364
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:18,656
To minimize or take away from

2365
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,448
The reality of abusive

2366
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,216
Against children

2367
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,496
I only want

2368
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:23,520
Two strap

2369
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:25,056
But Alex Jones

2370
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,080
Is using it

2371
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
For his own

2372
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
This is

2373
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,920
Your exploitation

2374
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:32,992
Cheats for money

2375
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,040
Well in Portugal work

2376
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,624
I would I mean

2377
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,696
I'm not I'm not I'm not willing

2378
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:43,488
To give him

2379
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,888
There's no all the Trump stuff I'm not willing to do any of the

2380
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,168
All of that

2381
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,448
Is in service

2382
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,472
To getting money

2383
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,776
I don't I think anything

2384
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,544
I think

2385
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,640
Ancillary

2386
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:04,480
Episode

2387
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,248
He's done this

2388
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
How to feel your b*******

2389
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:13,184
Not in not in the long-form narrative that we're seeing now this degree

2390
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:15,488
The only way to

2391
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,536
Conclude that the reason that he put

2392
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:19,072
The state are the only conclusion

2393
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:19,840
Draw

2394
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,608
Is that

2395
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,144
This is all a telephone

2396
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:26,496
Dark World version of

2397
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:33,408
Yes

2398
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,432
Jerry Lewis

2399
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:39,552
Jerry lizard has this is the underworld drywell version of

2400
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:46,208
Well I think I'm going to I'm going to amend my statement a tiny bit any of our drought

2401
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,768
Do you think I would have been

2402
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:52,608
Is that deposited and I I do believe

2403
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
The Daleks

2404
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,424
Or someone

2405
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,216
In-production knew that

2406
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:00,800
This fundraiser would get taken down and be able to use exploitative

2407
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:06,432
The only other possibility I can come up with is that the storyline that they were going to go with

2408
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,480
They lost

2409
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:10,528
This fundraiser

2410
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:13,088
And then Alex can be like

2411
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:15,392
So support our show cuz we're supporting

2412
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,952
And I would still give them fundraising possibility

2413
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:21,024
And then when the fundraiser is taken down

2414
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,376
He much like his criticized

2415
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,168
I did not let a crew.

2416
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,192
Crisis go to waste

2417
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:33,056
I think it's possible that there is that he's like oh that's make hay while the sun shines

2418
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:35,872
That's possible

2419
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:38,176
I think it's more likely that he knew who could take him down

2420
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,736
But this was all a setup from the gym

2421
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,528
This Vista

2422
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:44,064
Is one episode

2423
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:44,832
Both

2424
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,600
The Great

2425
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,368
That

2426
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,160
Are stupid verses

2427
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:49,440
Is evil continuum

2428
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,720
Evil is the one

2429
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,256
That wins all the way on the

2430
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Absolutely

2431
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:57,888
Even if my hypothetical other scenario is true that still

2432
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,192
Absolutely

2433
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,008

2434
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:06,336
