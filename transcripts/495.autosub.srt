1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,120
Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
We had we are not

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
People there

9
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Didn't have a quick question for you over the weekend

10
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
You and I got together

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,784
Had a lovely night and we did not record it for a

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
Yeah we could have though there's hilarity

13
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
Hilarities

14
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
God why don't we monetize social interaction we haven't really

15
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
We hung out too much

16
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,472
Yeah it was really good because we start maybe we started this whole thing as

17
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,032
Is just really good friends

18
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
And now we're back

19
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
Situation professionally or more professional

20
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,624
I enjoyed it. I had a great time as well good time

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
Masks

22
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,984
Theater mask

23
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
Yeah I know you got a mask

24
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
It's great

25
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
In Chicago a mask

26
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,552
Can you play everybody's always like I got a beard

27
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
Doesn't do that much between the hair does

28
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
My friend

29
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
American Septic

30
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,560
I would like to be around upon to wear a balaclava all the

31
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Previously it was just to burden

32
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
Summer whatever scarf around your face or nothing not the past I've had some

33
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
Scarves but they've been tough to keep on the head of course

34
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,416
It's great even if there wasn't a virus I'd be wearing a man. I don't know what these happy Masters are all going on about it very comfortable

35
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,000
Socially acceptable out of hell

36
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
Anyway this leads me to opening of the mailbag disease

37
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,472
Typically we have been doing some mailbag stuff on our bonus episodes

38
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
Would you can find even if you're not asleep

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,336

Like this was important

43
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,648
To go ahead and toss over your way

44
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Yes we got to a couple of hats

45
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,512
From Christina

46
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah

47
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
They say policy walk

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,728
A raptor princess winter hats

49
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,056
Jordan I hope he's had to keep your heads warm during the coming

50
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Uchicago winter

51
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,480
Making them was a pain in the ass but you guys are worth it because no Jordan the has eight garbage opinion on schitt's Creek

52
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
I got a PostScript to your we harvested 11 butternut squash is off one plant this year

53
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
Really good had to brag to my plant guy

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,655
I applaud you although I'm not a squash guy I'm not a gorgeous guy

55
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
I don't hoard to go

56
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,615
I don't know

57
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:37,503
Giving squash a bad rap I think I think it's something that's worth Explorer

58
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
In the future

59
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
If you are a

60
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
A giant robot

61
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
End

62
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Power Rangers

63
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
Given

64
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Title

65
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,327
And I know where I know where you're going with it like

66
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Lexi

67
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Taking a large number of pumps

68
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Skin landed

69
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
What would you be

70
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
No you would be

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
A Lord's sword hoarding courts

72
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Oh

73
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
I didn't realize I was going to have

74
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
Power Rangers hat on a hat

75
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
The sword is all you needed that is fair

76
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Anyway

77
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,415
Episode to go over I'm going to say that this is part 1 of 2

78
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Because

79
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
Stay here then can be next Monday

80
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
It will be the second part of this

81
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,679
Day before the 2020

82
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Kind of fitting

83
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Because what we're doing

84
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Is weird looking at these days

85
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Prior to the 20s

86
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
16 election on the Alex Jones Show

87
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Little blind

88
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:42,271
Spa in our history of covering Alex

89
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
A bit of a new understanding of what was going on

90
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,671
Okay I think I have a working theory that I have

91
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Google out of Coke

92
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
Just know

93
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,839
There is

94
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,423
A feeling that a lot of people have suggested

95
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
Floated that I've been resistant to

96
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,823
But looking at this time frame

97
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
Makes me a little bit more

98
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:13,759
Open-minded I think I will bear that out

99
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
But like I said

100
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
We're going to be looking at 2 November 4th

101
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
4th 5th and 6th

102
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,279
Today which is Friday Saturday Sunday night so we're not going to look at Saturday because it's mostly Owen Shroyer Joe Biggs

103
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
Right but Alex did a very special Saturday broadcast

104
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
Mostly in Friday and Sunday

105
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
And then part 2

106
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Is

107
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,543
Monday and Alex was doing a

108
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
52 hour marathon on Monday

109
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:44,735
Porta culminated in the election looking at the beginning stages of that autumn day

110
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
I meant okay

111
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
But before we get to business on this

112
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Stick little moments

113
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367

127
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
Money off that heroin

Gianna and think as much of Benghazi in the butter emails

130
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431

We'd appreciate it or

133
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,647
What you could do is rekindle your friendship with generosity invite

134
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Generosity over to your place

135
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
Eat some pizza play some party games together

136
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,143
And then send that generosity back out into the world to a local charity or Bell funded your arrow

137
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Fair enough thank you

138
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
So Jordan

139
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,543
Are toes in the water here on the 4th

140
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
November 4th 26

141
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
16

142
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Alex SB

143
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
How did it go

144
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
Four things that we would have wanted to have it

145
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
Alex is a big news

146
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
Headline

147
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
About the FBI

148
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Alright

149
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Quote

150
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
We believe she's the Antichrist

151
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
And we'll destroy the world go further what they said

152
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
But they believe

153
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Michelle wants to destroy the Earth

154
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Obama and Hillary are devil work

155
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Worshippers

156
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
The secret service has told me

157
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
Members of the military have told me

158
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
That

159
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,367
Obama seems really nice and all suddenly walking down the hall and it's like

160
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
I didn't tell you half of

161
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Okay just gets

162
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,023
We people are scared they don't want to be there

163
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
It's very dark

164
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Easier

165
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
The words I was told

166
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
And Hillary's even worse folks okay

167
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
So we were looking at earlier in 2016 and noting how little demon there was

168
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,407
0d Now by November 4th

169
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
Immediate review hard already

170
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
SBI

171
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
Apocalypse on us

172
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
That Hillary Clinton was going to end the world that were there were documents there was a guardian

173
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
And I believe

174
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
Guardian headline

175
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,119
Maybe put some Anonymous FBI person

176
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
Came out and said that

177
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
Hey there's a lot of people who take the cheese

178
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
Satan incarnate alright metaphorically of course

179
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
She is basically

180
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,783
Beelzebub walking the Earth investigation going to be the moment that we went

181
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
From metaphorical devil to literal devil

182
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
I hope not

183
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
But it is interesting

184
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
Seems to me they within the span of this year

185
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
That tone does

186
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Seem to have shifted

187
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
Quite a bit

188
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
This episode is

189
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,167
Sure there's nobody at least November 4th 2016

190
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Shift

191
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Is notable

192
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Yeah that

193
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Makes sense though like this is backed

194
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Two are the worst

195
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Trump is

196
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
The worst

197
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
They have to portray the enemy

198
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,759
And we're already at the point now where Trump is so bad

199
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
The only thing worse

200
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Is the literal Chris

201
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Some Subway

202
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
I think the other thing is

203
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
The popularity of the online pizza

204
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
Dipped into the occult

205
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,215
And I sent through yeah I think that that is a large portion of it because

206
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
It's kind of like

207
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055

Who they tried to get him

329
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Personally experienced this

330
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
When I was growing up in the richest county in Tech

331
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Because

332
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,735

00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Countryside

00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807

00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087

336
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367

Learn after I was dating her a week or so that that really love the

343
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
I was being recruited into

344
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Satanism

345
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,663
Duane's right the way he's talked about me I know you've heard this this sort of Taylor number of times but

346
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
In the past I've always heard

347
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
The story more as like it happened

348
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Wants

349
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
Maybe the cat fishing with the hot cheerleader with something that Satanist ride one

350
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Other things to get him into the ground

351
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
I didn't realize.

352
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
Did the way he seems to be describing it now it's like

353
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,167
He's dating some young lady and then

354
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,311
Not again not as far as the satanism

355
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Because we've heard multiple iteration many

356
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
Buy the one that I remember is that this happened when he was like

357
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
15 or so

358
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,807
He's dating this girl for about a week and then she invited him to her house

359
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
Giant mansion

360
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
All satan is over there in the basement

361
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
People are chopping up

362
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,023
Whatever yeah right Alex talks about it in another occasion

363
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
That like

364
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
There were police there any other runaway through the woods and then police stopped him as he was leaving

365
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,055
Stop stop

366
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Shots.

367
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,919
But I also remember that I think he said that this happened

368
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Also when he was like 8

369
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
Even goes

370
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
They caught me again I got

00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Drug back into it again like

00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,439
He's the idiot here

373
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,559
Childish story that's like

374
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Just cribbing from a movie

375
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,911
But when you're in Blake sort of express the idea that

376
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,471
Kept happening to it make

377
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Me

378
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
Think more about how like we might

379
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
KT Tape

380
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
A fool

381
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Perspective

382
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Of how

383
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Stream

384
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
Alex's religion might have been

385
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
As a child he might have

386
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Experience

387
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
Do not let say dating a woman

388
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:11,999
And them having liberal values to seduce them to the dark side

389
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
It could have been the way Alex process

390
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,167
Shame for having sexual urges towards these women

391
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Sure somehow evil

392
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
Or something

393
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
I don't know I don't know if any of that is

394
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
Is accurate at all but when I hear somebody say like

395
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Just kept happening to me

396
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Girls that were dating

397
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,575
Recruit me into Satanism right it makes me think that there's some sort of like

398
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Mean to him

399
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Something

400
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
Ryouri there's something he kept experience yeah yeah I'm not sure what it is but it doesn't seem

401
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,119
What's the

402
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
Alex actually drink blood

403
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
At a satanic

404
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
I think low

405
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Uniqlo

406
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Yeah you don't think he actually drink blood like an open one says add are at 1 if he's taking his

407
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:07,551
Bears happen all the time I'm going to say I think the odds are low that he's been to a Satanism party

408
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Now I've been to

409
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,927
Is a party it's a truth or dare there like what's your deepest Secret

410
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
Then I'm going to ask you this

411
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,607
If your sew-in with a Satanist you know everything about it I literally was my grandfather

412
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
The pecking order

413
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,191
Who's higher on the org chart

414
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Luciferians

415
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Spur Satanist

416
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
Luciferians are satanists

417
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,871
Right now satanists are a little bit of head butt

418
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:38,271
Kind of a horse race scenario you know one every 10 years the luciferians

419
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
Iron Man

420
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
The competition

421
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Well

422
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,999
Luciferian the way I do

423
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
I know okay

424
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
I know I reverse engineered it

425
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,959
My whole life's been basically brushing up against it over and over again

426
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Stephen King novel

427
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Okay

428
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,823
Gunslinger all right

429
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,359
And you need to understand

430
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
This stuff real

431
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
This stuff's going on

432
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
You'll understand that we're in deep

433
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
And the people

434
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
Realize

435
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
Hillary gets and she wants definition

436
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
She basically Linda Blair's folks

437
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
She rolled around the carpet

438
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Snapping

439
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Music

440
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Flips out

441
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
He goes into transfer

442
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,728
Chosen to transfer transfer Linda Blair's everyone

443
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Time to duel

444
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
Seems very busy busy

445
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
Freak-outs

446
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Public appearances

447
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:42,784
People are following her all day everyday in the last time just secretly do this

448
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,672
Need some self-care to Astro and for some people it's a bath for some people it's Linda Blair

449
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:54,560
I enjoy that it appears that this is

450
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,400
These demons and what have you been brushing up against Alex or his whole life is

451
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Because he's had his brain

452
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
For his whole life

453
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,800
Any experience as a lot of things as satanic nonsense

454
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
Yeah I've 1 out of 100 people

455
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
I'm going even further

456
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
1 out of 100 million people

457
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Experiences demons on a daily basis

458
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Maybe it's

459
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
Smallest 100 million people who run Baby It's You

460
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,160
But this also raises the question of like

461
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
Why wasn't his show always

462
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Is more

463
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Like this

464
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
That's fair

465
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,584
Why why is there so much more.

466
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Demon talk now why is that

467
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
Floodgate open

468
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,216
Like was he just holding that back

469
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,104
Write for years because he knew people would look at him like you

470
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Now it's now it's something

471
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,968
Thing that he can piggyback on or was it something that he's been hiding the whole

472
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
Right right I have no idea

473
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
Know his character

474
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
Seems to be

475
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
One that

476
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Would support

477
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:59,328
Because he's an extremist and he does seem a little bit unstable in terms of their belief

478
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,424
The influences that Alex says were around in his younger days

479
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
So I could see there being like a

480
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
Complete religious zealotry

481
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
He was hiding

482
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
Because he knew it wouldn't

483
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Be profitable

484
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,456
But then at the same time he's also a complete liar and a fraud

485
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
So

486
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,064
Makes sense that he could have added that to his character

487
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
It's some point

488
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,464
It's it's three it's very difficult to tell what sincere and what's not

489
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Chinese knot

490
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Kicked off of

491
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Social media

492
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Like he's still

493
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Because

494
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,888
When he's kicked off social media

495
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
You go too deep

496
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Men's why not your

497
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Nobody

498
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
You still on social and he's already

499
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,336
Demon so that kind of gets rid of that

500
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,456
Theory of like 120 got kicked off social media all of the stuff that he has been hiding

501
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
I think I think it's

502
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Probably related

503
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
2

504
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
WikiLeaks

505
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,952
I am the pizzagate nonsense

506
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
The theory that whether it's

507
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Organic

508
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
Or

509
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:13,568
The organic version will be that he'd been holding this back and visit normalizes that kind of conversate we're sure she's doing jumps into the water

510
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,616
Coronavirus

511
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,944
Or if he's like okay this is a great way to go yours always

512
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
Sensationalizing

513
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
This is the new editorial line

514
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
I'm here I think that the

515
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
The normalization that came

516
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
From

517
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
The way the internet went nuts

518
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
I think that's

519
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
That's probably what allowed him

520
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
Do the demons

521
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Disconnect Clips on 4th

522
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
For Alex

523
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
Traffic is worse by the day

524
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
We're now four days out

525
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
3in changed

526
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Technically

527
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
The hammer

528
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
Drip now is getting stronger

529
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
Bowling

530
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
Thunder cracks now

531
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
What are they going to do

532
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
A false flag

533
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
I knew Sandy Hook

534
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Launch a new war

535
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
What are they going to do to stop

536
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
So

537
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
I would say nothing of the weather going to do in New Sandy Hook replies that they did the old Sandy Hook yeah

538
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:19,616
Alright Alex

539
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:24,480
I'd learned the truth apologize for all the

540
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
Pain you caused people

541
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:32,416
Only just I think I don't think he was being very sincere and I'd say that was a lie

542
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
It's almost

543
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,024
Wall-to-wall carpeting

544
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
Hillary Clinton

545
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Is it God damn

546
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:47,520
Expect us a few days out you got a hammer surprised about is how thick

547
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
The argument is

548
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
One of the big things is just

549
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,688
Podesta's email to

550
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
Being used

551
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,416
Yeah and then this is the other one

552
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,488
Bill Clinton says I practice voodoo

553
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
I think this is wonderful

554
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
Who wrote a book

555
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Bill Clinton's book

556
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
Where he talks

557
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
About it

558
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
How great it is

559
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Add another copy

560
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Print it up

561
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
It's My Life the earlier

562
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
Here's the passage from Bill Clinton's book my life

563
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
I was pretty

564
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,792
Particularly intrigued by the voodoo religion and culture to which I had some limited exposure in New Orleans

565
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,608
And that existed alongside Catholicism in Haiti

566
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,192
The name of the traditional Haitian religion comes from the Fawn language of

567
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,752
Banana in West Africa where Voodoo originated

568
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:56,896
It means god or Spirit without the connotations of black magic and Witchcraft attached to it in so many movies

569
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,992
Voodoo Central ritual is a dance during which Spirits possess believers

570
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
On the most

571
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Interesting day of the

572
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
The trip I got a chance to observe Voodoo in practice

573
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
David Citibank

574
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Contact in Port-au-Prince

575
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
I offered to take him Hilary and me to a nearby Village

576
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
To meet an unusual voodoo priest

577
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:18,400
Max Beauvoir had spent 15 years outside Haiti's studying at the sorbonne in Paris

578
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
And working in New York

579
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,008
He had a beautiful blonde French wife into bright young daughter

580
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,104
He been practicing chemical engineering until he's Voodoo priests

581
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,432
Grandfather on his deathbed chose Max to succeed him

582
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
Max was a Believer and he did

583
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
It must have been a pro

584
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Approved

585
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
A challenge

586
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Bruce ranch wife

587
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
And westernized

588
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Kids

589
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,952
We arrived in the late afternoon an hour or so before the dance ceremony which

590
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:46,304
Which Max open to pay interest as a way of covering some of the cost of his operation

591
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:52,192
He explained it in Voodoo God is Manifest to humans through spirits that represent forces of light and darkness

592
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Good and Evil

593
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Which are more or less

594
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Imbalance

595
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,104
After Hillary David and I finished our brief course in Voodoo theology

596
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,688
We were escorted back to an open area and seeded with other guests

597
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Who would come to witness

598
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Miss the ceremony

599
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
In which Spirits are called forth

600
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
And enter into the bodies of Dance

601
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Believers

602
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
After several minutes of rhythmic dance

603
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Pounding drums

604
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
The spirits arrived

605
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Season the woman and a man

606
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,328
The man proceeded to rub a burning torch all over his body and walk on hot coals without being burned

607
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,936
The woman in a frenzy screams repeatedly then grabbed a live chicken and bit his head off

608
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
Then the spirits left and those that have been possessed Felder

609
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
To the ground

610
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:33,408
I described my brief foray into the world of voodoo because I've always been fascinated by the way different cultures try to make sense

611
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Life nature

612
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,528
And the virtually Universal belief that there is a non-physical Spirit Force

613
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,344
At work in the world that existed before Humanity

614
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
And we'll be here when we're all long gone

615
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,000
Haitians understanding of how God is Manifest in our lives is very different

616
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
Automatic most Christians Jews or Muslims

617
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,376
But they're documented experiences certainly proves the old adage

618
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
That the Lord works

619
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
Mysterious ways

620
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
Silence is taking this passage of a interesting

621
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
For inexperienced

622
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
Yeah I had turned it into

623
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Billy Mitchell

624
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,968
He loves Voodoo he does it all the time him and Hillary SP

625
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,784
It's his business bad

626
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,064
So flimsy

627
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
It does

628
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,160
Surprise me that a benign

629
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
Admiration for another culture

630
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,304
Would be misinterpreted as joining the literal Christian devil

631
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
But what does

632
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Surprise me

633
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
Is that nobody has written

634
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
A roach

635
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Trip movie

636
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
About a guy

637
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
Who is a chemical engineer

638
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,152
All the sudden his grandfather's like guess what you're the priest now

639
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
Is there any starts with him rubbing fire on himself in Hugo

640
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,832
I guess you're wondering how I got here and then we started all the ways easy

641
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,648
It wrote itself right now

642
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:54,048
Finish your book movie to work on this movie I just found this to be like

643
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Wow you're making an

644
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Our out of this

645
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
Yeah this is

646
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
This is

647
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
Ready

648
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
Software

649
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,544
I don't know man I just think

650
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
If you're in Haiti

651
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
And someone is like hey do you want to come

652
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,624
I don't know why you would ever say no do your very interesting experience

653
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,720
I don't know that's all I see in that Clinton book give you the opportunity

654
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
Opportunities

655
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
You f****** go

656
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,376
Yeah but why go other places if you don't

657
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Experience

658
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
Things that are part of

659
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Those places

660
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,264
That's why Alex doesn't really go other places

661
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,360
The hike-and-bike trails

662
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,480
So Alex Alakazam inside information about how all these these

663
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
Globalist

664
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
They're all Satanist

665
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,576
Chanel kill children who are

666
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
Anna's note

667
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Just a little warning

668
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
This shows

669
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,768
Let's just say it didn't like in your Hollywood movie where they just got your little heart out

670
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
We have a lot of love

671
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Until you

672
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
Aleister Crowley black magic house

673
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Chile

674
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
The standard

675
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
Maybe I don't even want to talk

676
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
Yeah that's a great I do already just

677
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,936
Children are probably

678
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,824
This nonsense bulshit year olds out there you want to hear how Aleister Crowley says

679
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
To kill three-year-olds

680
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,664
Alright other round

681
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
So

682
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
This is an interesting clip

683
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,040
As we know Alex did not go to college

684
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
He does know that in

685
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
College

686
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Sometimes

687
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,696
Secret societies

688
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Still have you do things

689
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:04,352
Get you in little by little until you what you're going to find your in

690
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:08,192
Alright

691
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
To join his secret society kitten

692
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
We know that he is

693
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:17,920
Refuse to debate you absolutely

694
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
I would take Mike down for this cuz I'd like you to

695
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Consider the order

696
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,112
Of things

697
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
Imaginary college student

698
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,720
What kind of like in college where

699
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
We have sex with a goat

700
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
And the next

701
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
You doing something

702
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Next it

703
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Sex

704
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Again

705
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
You know what we're going to go

706
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,368
Okay so that is not the order

707
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
It shows Alex is mine though homosexual sex is an escalation

708
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
F*** this go

709
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,984
You did it while wouldn't expect that you don't have sex with me

710
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
All right now let's go kill a homeless person

711
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,616
I am really thrown off by you man

712
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,968
Sex with a code does not seem like it would be the entry point

713
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,552
Hey well if you f*** ago you f******

714
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Is that what he's trying to say

715
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
You people in this cold must have such a low self-esteem I'm not ready to

716
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,048
You're not ready for me yet you got to f*** a goat

717
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,680
That just shows a bit of his homophobia and then also the quote

718
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,496
Homosexual

719
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Ticket today

720
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,568
Yeah I found that to be interesting

721
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,920
Partially because I was just making everything up sure all it is is just a reflection

722
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
Tune of like

723
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,504
His own biases

724
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,392
Yeah he's revealing himself by

725
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Before the election

726
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
Alex isn't

727
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Fully on board

728
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,280
With the GOP because the GOP

729
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Has not come on board with

730
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Was Trump right

731
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
And the growing

732
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
Tide towards

733
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
White Christian heterosexual

734
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,032
Hegemony and authoritarianism

735
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
He thinks that the Republicans kind of Evil 2

736
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
The Democrats

737
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
Kendall

738
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,808
The Republicans are into Germanic

739
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Versions of this is like a Germanic

740
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Mix

741
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
With the very same old mystery

742
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
Eastern mysticism

743
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
Mystery religion Babylon

744
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
Different churches

745
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Of the same religion

746
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Different flavors of the same

747
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Garbage

748
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Rich and

749
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
So much about this

750
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
30 years later

751
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Burgers Lake

752
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:09,184
I know that they tried to recruit me basically into three different branches of the scrap

753
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
It's the real big religion of America

754
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,632
The real religion of America

755
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,448
The Democrats are into Aleister Crowley nagaland

756
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
Guns are not

757
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:28,896
Enter into Germanic mysticism

758
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
Yeah I would say this is stupid

759
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,856
Everything about it

760
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
It really becomes

761
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,976
That much more stupid when you hear him try to talk

762
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
Specific

763
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
Why use number

764
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
And by the way

765
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
The Democrat

766
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
Far worse number

767
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,216
They are basically 90%

768
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
Taking over at the highest levels

769
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
Fat people doing the worst of you could imagine

770
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
Republicans is about 30%

771
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
50%

772
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
A few years ago

773
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Politically

774
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
Has really brought the pain

775
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
I know

776
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
That good

777
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
Percent

778
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
Doing what more do you want

779
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,024
We're working on our Delaware's for numbers

780
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,424
We've initiated some rules and regulations in place to an hour down

781
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,824
Board meeting somewhere where they're like all our Satanism numbers are down what are we what are we doing

782
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
Like what are we what are we doing I would like to know how Alex I'd like to know

783
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,600
I want to know I want to know about your methodology definition

784
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Terms

785
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
How does one become

786
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Part of this twenty-five 30%

787
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
See now I'm just now I'm back

788
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,400
Madmen and Don Draper is giving an amazing beautiful speech about how we should all become Satanist pedophile

789
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Sounds like that's what I'm seeing

790
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,520
Know what this is is Alex's way to support

791
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Brightwing

792
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Conservative

793
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Republican

794
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Bulshit

795
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,224
But at the same time pretend that he's like

796
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
Above The Fray

797
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
Here's my

798
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,536
Strongman and then I'm going to call my guys

799
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,144
Strawman and then I will never be anywhere

800
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,472
Yep interesting Poppin

801
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,032
From someone who I haven't I heard

802
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
For a long time he's not on the show anymore

803
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,480
Basically there's lots of different celebrities that are you know talk about the Illuminati like Jay-Z

804
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
And

805
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
Some of the other celebrities that sort of hand at it with the imagery inside of their videos

806
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
Etc and the question is is this always just some sort of

807
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
Playful take

808
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
On

809
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,816
On spiritualism and it just kind of let you know

810
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Spooky like Halloween

811
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Or is it real

812
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,912
You think that's real

813
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
It's real now

814
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
Do you know who that was

815
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:08,896
Play with my friends back in high school with the Wu-Tang Clan

816
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
Cuz they didn't know

817
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
Sure I know that you got is that

818
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:18,112
What are we doing with the Kraken

819
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
I don't know who it is

820
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,560
Buckley

821
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,376
What are the Illuminati celebrities are real serious

822
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
That does make sense that Buckley is

823
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,472
Is like Jay-Z talks about the Illuminati

824
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
He thought he was

825
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
Is joking

826
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Yeah

827
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Sick beat

828
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,152
Jay-Z I would like you to wrap over one of these tracks

829
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Baobab

830
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
Zoom out pretty fast

831
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
A couple minutes

832
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Then Alex drawers

833
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
What is top researcher

834
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,232
Alright

835
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
Okay

836
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Got really strange

837
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Because

838
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
My cup should have runneth over

839
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
Because then what should happen

840
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
But Alex has

841
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,008
F****** John Rappaport, in

842
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
Yeah Batman's in studio

843
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Tumi

844
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
Very honorable

845
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:17,760
He's in studio yeah he only does the fourth hour

846
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:22,880
Very rare that unless Alex needs a very serious pep talk

847
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:29,024
It's a terrible interview it's pointless I couldn't even find anything that Rose to the level of Interest wow

848
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
It's just kind of like

849
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
Yeah they're demon called

850
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
Alright great

851
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,728
And then there's a pointless interview with William Binney

852
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,056
All that doesn't lie forever technical head of the NSA

853
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Not nothing in

854
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Interested banana

855
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
It's just

856
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,528
Wikileaks got stuff from the good guys in the government is supposed to hacker

857
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
I don't suppose that at

858
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,464
It surprises me much though since we are so close to the election I imagine nobody's

859
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
Is coming up with too many big

860
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Big swings other than like

861
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
We got to do everything we can to stop Hillary from being present

862
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
You no like

863
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
He's coming up with Eric

864
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
They're really good.

865
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
There is

866
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Steaming

867
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
Focused

868
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,640
Maybe that's more what I'm getting the gist of

869
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
I think I think

870
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,760
It's focused is fair but it's focused

871
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,856
Strangeway

872
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
And it doesn't feel ambitious

873
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
Listening to this

874
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,744
Spell Alot Like people treading water

875
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
Seemed weird to me

876
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Nowadays

877
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
How Alex is screaming yeah

878
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,704
Bloody murder in lakes

879
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Spitting

880
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,776
Out of his mouth while he yells

881
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
The behaviors

882
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
Very very

883
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
Very different

884
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
And no baby part of it is because I was

885
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
Just freaked out by the idea of people who drink

886
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
He's not going to drink blood

887
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,088
With John podesta

888
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,416
Billion dollars

889
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
I mean you could not

890
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Amy

891
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
80 trillion-dollar

892
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
Words to be around these people

893
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
To be with them

894
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
To drink

895
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,656
Stop that I couldn't drink blood

896
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,264
What am I done the old Hunter ritual you know when you're ready to shoot your first beer to drink

897
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Being a hunter

898
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
+ 1

899
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,992
Okay so you drink blood in a ritual

900
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
Almost almost

901
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:34,208
Ancient Pagan hunting ritual

902
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,280
That I don't understand proves that my

903
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Anime

904
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,864
Demon blood rituals

905
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,936
I have engaged in a blood ritual when I was eight

906
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
So f****** RV

907
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,312
Obituary what's a good ritual in a bad ritual

908
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:55,711
Cuz this is a classic moment from The Alex Jones

909
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Show that I did not realize

910
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,039
This is from this November 4th episode but this

911
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,111
This is a clip that will live in infamy

912
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
After this point

913
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,839
Resistance to tyrants is obedience

914
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,471
Alex I think about

915
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,287
Children Hillary Clinton is personally murdered

916
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,455
Lady Gaga

917
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
Personally murdered children

918
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
Is

919
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
What about the devil worship

920
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Campaign chairman

921
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,591
Leave the menu of blood and semen and

922
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
Aleister Crowley

923
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
The private event

924
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,223
Talk about that

925
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
I mean 200,000-plus dead

926
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
Christian

927
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
Operation in Syria

928
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
Are operation in Libya and not let the crew

929
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
Christians get out and indirect

930
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
Al-Qaeda and Isis

931
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
To Target and murder

932
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
Children and put up their sex slavery

933
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
Priest off cliff

934
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,143
And kill people in masks and murder gays

935
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
And everything else you could imagine

936
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Because I don't like

937
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
Peaceful people

938
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
That is a classic clip from Ali

939
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
He will later use

940
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
Is a ton

941
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
Because people in the news

942
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
I believe you may be the Megyn Kelly interview

943
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,551
Took the clip of him saying that Hillary Clinton

944
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,951
Personally has killed all of these children

945
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,511
Spoke to be there you spoke

946
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Poorly

947
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
Your contacts

948
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Text is

949
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
Is here within the

950
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
Consigns of a sentence

951
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Well it's

952
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
Two different thoughts

953
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,775
Because if you want to

954
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,335
Hillary's foreign-policy and things

955
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,687
Decisions that were made while she was at the state department and how's that had

956
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
Ramifications that are not good

957
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
You deserve

958
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
Course

959
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
Fine yes

960
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,951
Now I understand that Alex thinks that he's just sensationalizing it by saying

961
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,511
What order or trying to get attention by saying she's

962
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,583
Personally killed all these

963
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
An incorrect state

964
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,215
Career over sensationalizing it in a way that is only men

965
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
Kind of debate people

966
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,031
Into

967
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
Pointing out that your

968
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:35,967
Those assholes Great Clips for him

969
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Symbol for a bunch of that sir

970
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
Something like that you could you could get around

971
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
Did rhetorical move

972
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,439
He's trying to make sure just did a really poorly

973
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
I feel like

974
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,791
He did exactly what he wanted to do

975
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
Yes

976
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
But

977
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,703
If you are somebody who actually understands our language work

978
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
Right

979
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
He did he did this

980
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Move portal

981
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
Oh oh yeah

982
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
If what he was

983
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Trying to say if bouquet

984
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,455
If we are measuring the ability he

985
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
Hadwin

986
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
Saying what it was

987
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,295
Ostensibly tried to

988
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831
He did a bad job

989
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Yes if we look at

990
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Somebody who

991
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,975
Realizes that nobody's going to come after him for it

992
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
And

993
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,815
It's to say whatever he wants you at hopefully will

994
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
Go viral with it

995
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
He did it

996
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,263
Exactly the best attention

997
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
Albuterol

998
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
I've heard this a bunch of times

999
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,479
Alex's mother Gaston

1000
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
One of your favorite

1001
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,647
He he's a guy who Alex

1002
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
For a while

1003
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
Doug Hagmann

1004
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,815
I've been hearing for 15 years on Coast to Coast AM

1005
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
I thought

1006
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,631
That guy is

1007
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
Is 2 radical

1008
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Why would he says I know is accurate

1009
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
A lot of it

1010
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
I just did too much

1011
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
He said they were going to bring in mass of Muslims at some point

1012
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Caliphate

1013
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
He said they were to use a strategy of tension

1014
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,199
He said a lot of things and then about

1015
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
Man

1016
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
That'll

1017
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
More of it what

1018
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
When what my sources

1019
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
Are we Cowboys

1020
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
Secret Service

1021
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
Did that already happen

1022
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
NYPD

1023
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,023
Now one of those dishes bongino butt

1024
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,095
You just outed bongino

1025
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,887
Like that yes shitbag

1026
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:35,775
You guys are really fast and loose with your sources did not realize we were already a caliph

1027
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,639
Yeah

1028
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,175
Yep

1029
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,711
So this

1030
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,015
This has to do with

1031
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
The weiners laptop

1032
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,135
Yeah they're talking about how

1033
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
The New York

1034
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695
FBI

1035
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Forced

1036
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Call me

1037
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:00,863
To come out and reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails work because if they did

1038
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
If you didn't do that

1039
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,799
Then they were going to have a press conference where they're going to reveal everything that was on Weiner's laptop should I kill me

1040
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
Later

1041
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
When can we eat comes out and says

1042
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,687
Deny everything yeah

1043
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Closed

1044
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
The investigation closed

1045
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,295
Alex is really have a great answer for that

1046
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,367
But Doug Hagmann he had a source

1047
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,903
But it said that they were going to

1048
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,767
To do this but they were going to have a press conference

1049
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
Gloats about being right

1050
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,215
Before a Hagmann gets into the show proper

1051
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
Alex has to do what he does best

1052
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,543
And that is fake crying

1053
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Let me tell you some

1054
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,639
Agents and their senior

1055
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Pretty tops

1056
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Uno

1057
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,551
The shooting there

1058
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,159
She's really really scared

1059
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,887
Her children books

1060
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:12,543
I thought he was doing an impression I give it to

1061
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
I did not

1062
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
Now that's

1063
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
That's bad

1064
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,151
I don't buy that for

1065
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Second

1066
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,479
Snow fairies yeah I thought it was

1067
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
Drake nope

1068
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:27,647
It's it's not just purposefully not purposefully face because he starts talking more and

1069
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,719
And it has the lingering of the the crying out

1070
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:35,071
I know we've heard Alex talk a lot

1071
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,679
Pretty regularly about the possibility that there we all deserve for the earth to be

1072
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
Destroyed

1073
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
Because we're bad

1074
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
The globalist

1075
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,383
Yeah it turns out this might be your four of him

1076
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,431
Maybe we deserve a nuclear war

1077
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,807
Maybe that's

1078
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
We still be able to torture little kids to death anymore

1079
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,927
Mom

1080
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
Hillary Lane Andover

1081
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
Your backyard

1082
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
How's that sound

1083
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Not good

1084
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:17,311
I do think that it's interesting that

1085
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,359
You know Alex is a silver linings

1086
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,943
He has a silver lining Sky maybe no one will let you know they won't

1087
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,039
If everyone dies there will be no more

1088
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
Great

1089
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
D'Artagnan comes in

1090
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,183
You want to talk about the codes

1091
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
In the email I would like to talk about

1092
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
There is a sub

1093
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,351
Text or coating to some of the emails

1094
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
Others have

1095
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
Including Hillary

1096
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,751
And who am I have been engaged in

1097
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,543
For example

1098
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,359
The party I'll just leave this out there

1099
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
Pizza party that's not exactly what it means

1100
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,455
Don't bring

1101
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,271
Do you know don't bring your favorite video over for a

1102
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
Pizza night

1103
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Pizza party to something else

1104
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
Sexual connotations

1105
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
IFly

1106
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
They'll be semen they'll be

1107
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
They'll be

1108
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,815
They'll be blood lots of blood

1109
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:18,239
Not exactly it does I mean you could go to

1110
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Yeah

1111
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Well I do

1112
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Yes

1113
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,687
Why would you use blood is that why would blood be a code word

1114
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
That's a terrible idea

1115
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
Alright alright.

1116
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
Ultimately the plan is

1117
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:36,159
To drink blood blood

1118
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:40,511
What's your safe word elsafe never catch on to the fact

1119
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Blood

1120
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Little boy

1121
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583

Screener

1125
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,823
16

1126
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Can VHS

1127
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,431
I think that the idea of some of these parties

1128
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,271
Are like dinner parties with like a couple couple

1129
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:06,623
So maybe you're coming over and someone has an actual like

1130
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Hot

1131
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
Pizza oven

1132
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:15,583
Rygar brick-oven get together and you make a pizza and then maybe Wildwood pizza cooking or some

1133
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,911
Something you I have a video

1134
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,775
Sure or maybe like I said maybe it's green or maybe you have an advance copy of something

1135
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,359
Cuz your written exam a Hollywood party you're right that's what we're dealing with here

1136
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,151
Shoe powerful you got it.

1137
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,479
Bring over some dumb

1138
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,063
Commoners can't watch Ironman

1139
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,903
Is Doug Hagmann on that bringing videos over Iron Man 7

1140
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
I don't know

1141
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,327
Hilarious

1142
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,143
Clearly I just wanted to make it clear that this

1143
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Thesaurus

1144
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:57,567
Is within the orbit of the F4 the NYPD FBI investigation on the ground

1145
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,103
In New York

1146
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
New York City and Westchester

1147
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
Chester County as well

1148
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,735
Specifically New York City

1149
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
I should have said that

1150
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
There's an investigation going on

1151
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
What are you doing

1152
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
What is

1153
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,231
What is happening

1154
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
Well I should look at that

1155
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,839
Whoops a doodle I'm a professional

1156
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
Oh man

1157
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
Accidentally

1158
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:31,103
Possibly reveal too much information about your Source on 8-0 syndicated radio show

1159
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
Should decide that

1160
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,687
Yep

1161
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,015
Rudy Giuliani should have said that whoops to doodle

1162
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
My bad

1163
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:43,135
He's most he's laundering bulshit towards me and now here we are

1164
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,439
Oh what an ass off

1165
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,023
I don't know anyway

1166
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Think of something that needs a citation

1167
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,351
From

1168
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,911
And by the way that there will be at least

1169
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
6 if not 8

1170
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
Or more verified

1171
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,287
By Hillary

1172
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,103
And by Houma on the Lolita Express

1173
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,175
Course you talked about that Prince's saying that to

1174
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,015
You know it's like the

1175
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,319
Crossroads

1176
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
What does information

1177
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
You're supposed to hate him

1178
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
Alright

1179
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Okay first

1180
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
I understand

1181
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
But there's only one per

1182
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
All right you don't get to refer to Erik Prince by his last

1183
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
There's one prints

1184
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
If you say prince

1185
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,911
You know who are talk

1186
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,471
The mercenary formerly known as

1187
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,007
Tell me about Erik Prince

1188
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:35,359
Yeah. Information about these trip

1189
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,943
Huma and Hillary Express

1190
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,063
Provide documentation whenever you're ready where were they going

1191
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,743
Of course he has a star-studded show on November 4th

1192
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:58,143
Rapoport

1193
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,191
Rapoport yet Buckley

1194
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:04,031
William now you got Rodger

1195
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:08,383
You supposed to have Steve but his phone didn't work

1196
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:15,551
Call old man house phone I got very excited cuz I got teased with a Steve

1197
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
Not materialized

1198
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
You got Rodger

1199
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,415
All right boring interview

1200
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:24,767
Quite frankly that Rodger says

1201
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
That I found very

1202
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:32,191
Am I wrong and he's ahead and all the Battleground States even pulls oversampling looks like Landslide for Trump

1203
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
Cautiously

1204
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:44,479
Bigger women Reagan addirittura zor-el

1205
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,295
I'm cautiously

1206
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
Spirits

1207
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
Happier

1208
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,047
Alright Rogerstown will talk to you soon thank you my friend

1209
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:06,239
Is very f****** different we're stealing this election

1210
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,591
Cautiously optimistic about the theft

1211
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
That is about

1212
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
To take place

1213
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,991
It's really it's really weird I do I don't know if I

1214
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,039
I heard it the same way you're hearing at

1215
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,831
I heard it as

1216
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,159
We have no expectation that we're going to win

1217
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
I heard it as

1218
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,463
Voting

1219
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,767
Machines in Georgia are definitely going to work this time

1220
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,095
I get I get where you're coming from on that

1221
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,631
I think it's the other way around

1222
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
I think it's

1223
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:41,311
We get to talk about the voting machines not working after we lose

1224
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,383
To me it doesn't feel like any of them are really

1225
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,663
Expectation

1226
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,759
It really feels like they're all getting ready for Hillary

1227
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:54,367
Yeah they are all that but yeah so is everybody we were all ready for it

1228
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,439
Don't hear much talk about Trump

1229
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,815
At all on this November 4th episode

1230
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,119
The demons have they get in it's over

1231
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:11,519
I guess electioneering for Trump giveaway Hillary is our kid

1232
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,055
Her eyes upon it brought like

1233
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
Still

1234
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
There is not like

1235
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,431
Merely the quantity of

1236
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:23,295
Trump is our savior

1237
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,599
There's little flickers of it now

1238
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,671
Not nearly as much as you might expect these before the 20th

1239
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
16 election

1240
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,279
It's mostly about how bad Hillary is happened to me

1241
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
It feels

1242
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
Like

1243
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,631
We're getting ready for next season

1244
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Right

1245
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Because it doesn't

1246
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,239
Feel like the end of the world if Trump loses

1247
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,567
Yeah

1248
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,359
Talk of like

1249
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:54,015
No it's not like well shrub loses its time to Gunn everyone down there still talk of like satanism

1250
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,551
But it's almost in a way that's like

1251
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
Productive for Alex

1252
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
The yellow about later

1253
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,927
It really I have had a very strong

1254
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,207
Reluctance

1255
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
I too agree with people who think like

1256
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:10,143
Alex wanted Hillary to win

1257
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,471
I don't know we'll see what happens on the the the

1258
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,263
Later episodes

1259
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
It does not feel like he's

1260
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Fully

1261
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
Meeting

1262
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,919
Trump to win the way he does now it is funny

1263
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
That

1264
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,711
Our

1265
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
Situation is so warped

1266
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,783
But Alex being like

1267
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:32,671
Hillary Clinton is a pedophile murderers the devil and we're like

1268
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,951
He's kind of ambivalent about

1269
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:40,607
This election might notice he seems weirdly chill

1270
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,167
Calling her a pedophile demon

1271
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,471
Borderline nothing

1272
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,871
Yeah it's it's it's the definition on that I had to look the background is it work for Trump as opposed to me

1273
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,967
Like this is this is about building up a villain

1274
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
For your neck

1275
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,295
Pay-per-view or whatever like is not

1276
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
I don't know it it it was definitely not what I

1277
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,647
I expected I wonder if there's

1278
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,463
Going to be I wouldn't be surprised if there was some like

1279
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
Serious

1280
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,303
Historical work that was like Hillary Clinton

1281
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,631
Is literally the only politician that could have ever lost

1282
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
Austin election to Donald

1283
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,055
You do a really fascinating probably come up with a couple others

1284
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
I imagine

1285
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,967
McVay

1286
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,551
I think you could probably come up with thousands of people that could

1287
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,599
Lose

1288
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:38,207
I agree that I think of leading let's say possible Democratic candidates

1289
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,999
She would be probably of

1290
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,279
Few

1291
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,071
That that would

1292
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,351
Who could be realistic

1293
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,679
The candidates have lost

1294
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
A lot of that is

1295
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,031
Not necessarily her fault

1296
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,871
A lot of it is just based on

1297
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
You know

1298
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,735
S*** Larry Nichols David

1299
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Dislike

1300
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
It's

1301
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
It's not that they just

1302
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,159
Just got the propaganda train rolling on her in

1303
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,183
In 2015

1304
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Or whatever

1305
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
That's been going on

1306
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
30

1307
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
Years by that

1308
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Yeah

1309
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
Longer if you lived in Arkansas

1310
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,655
I think if your political strategy

1311
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,423
Just you think like

1312
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Well

1313
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,007
Yes there is that right

1314
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
But

1315
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,359
That's been going on forever over it

1316
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,687
Most people know it's nonsense a lot of this is be bunked

1317
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,479
Entirely totally

1318
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,551
And unfortunately it is

1319
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,111
It appears that might be a miscalculation

1320
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Democrat

1321
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:43,231
Never fail to overestimates

1322
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,399
These sorts of propaganda campaigns it existed over decade

1323
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,703
Shiraz did they wouldn't be as potent

1324
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
Or as

1325
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,519
As mean

1326
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,823
Painful but now it's very easy to look back

1327
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
I can say now look at those

1328
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
Is idiots making that choice

1329
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:07,295
The time we were all like yeah there's no way Bernie's going to be there this year

1330
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
And I would have said like

1331
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,671
Nobody's going to care about like Vince Foster s*** notion

1332
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,487
Turn down

1333
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,839
So Steve was supposed to be on but he's not answer Alex's to Philz

1334
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
Sometime

1335
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
In front of a golf

1336
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
Pizza okay

1337
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,263
About two months ago I was on the hike-and-bike trail

1338
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,359
Security reasons now always bring somebody with me and we're always

1339
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
Locked and loaded as well

1340
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,455
Quite frankly my hand inside baseball

1341
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Pappadeaux's on around here but

1342
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,623
And I'm like 100 yards away and I saw the

1343
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,671
He's really super white looking people in Black

1344
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,351
And if I got up close to him they all had like pentagram necklaces there

1345
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Super white and leak

1346
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,215
Do the old woman a younger woman in the manager either

1347
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,567
There went the hell I was going down the hill

1348
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,151
And I was like I sent them 100 yards away like I was at

1349
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,759
They were so weak

1350
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,295
They think they're powerful

1351
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
Totally turned over to Eatonville

1352
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Thunder like

1353
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,207
The most pathetic people

1354
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:22,815
Remind just be some metal fan he's just ate did he just discovered golf's

1355
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,607
Is that what just happened

1356
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:30,239
Alex's life is so boring that two months ago he's awesome godson the hike-and-bike trail to

1357
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
Jesus

1358
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,711
I can feel I can feel pale people in the in the Wind

1359
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,015
Jesus Christ

1360
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,063
I would have preferred if he did

1361
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Pollo Tropical

1362
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,367
Joke

1363
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:51,743
Soggoth running and I leaned out the window of the car and went

1364
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,023
Where's the

1365
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
Funeral

1366
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,583
Like that's that's all I want

1367
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
That's as bad as

1368
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,959
Is it could be well that's direct bullying this is just Alex bullying somebody on a

1369
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:07,359
F****** show mother later or no

1370
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
Earth and

1371
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Explaining

1372
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,319
Why God allows us human

1373
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
Exist

1374
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
Interesting

1375
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Theological

1376
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
Appointed

1377
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
But I disagree with

1378
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,767
And so that's why God allows us to exist

1379
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
Murder Hornets

1380
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,631
Bird's eye view

1381
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,591
Do Souls do creatures new free entities Gods created

1382
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
Just sit here and be told about him

1383
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
You have to experience it

1384
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
You have to live it

1385
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
You have to be

1386
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
Tortured by

1387
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
You will always

1388
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,695
Spiritual memory

1389
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
Pascal nasty

1390
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
This is

1391
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,815
So that you've chosen

1392
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
Which side you want to be on

1393
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
Not with her

1394
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,703
Never with this

1395
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Never

1396
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,775
Never with these people

1397
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
Harlan

1398
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,479
Weather pain

1399
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
What the failure

1400
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,527
Ugliness

1401
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,343
Weather weather weather

1402
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,159
No. Would you ever

1403
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,975
Alex is Hillary's slogan

1404
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,375
I don't know I would say that if we are our ancestors than we should have all of their Spears

1405
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Virtual memory

1406
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,215
He's too and I guess if evil has ever been experienced

1407
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,543
In human history then we would all have our ancestors

1408
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:46,943
Spiritual memories of that evil viscerally so we wouldn't need to re-experience it over and over again

1409
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,991
Sure I don't know I think this is all stupid

1410
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,527
And I disagree with

1411
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,135
A lot of people say I know

1412
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,951
Did I shouldn't jump off the the

1413
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
But I'm telling you right now

1414
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:05,375
You can't know that it's a bad idea unless you jump unless you breathe jumping off that bridge

1415
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,679
How much you eat jumping off that bridge

1416
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,775
Unless the Lord himself tells you that jumping off that bridge

1417
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
Is it bad thing

1418
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,591
And that's why you got to jump off the bridge

1419
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,615
You can't know that

1420
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,639
Evil is bad

1421
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,687
Haha unless you jump off at

1422
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Okay

1423
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
I make sense

1424
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,551
I just I don't know what this is

1425
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
That's very stupid

1426
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
Like I said the 5th is not worthwhile

1427
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,743
I got really excited cuz Alex said that he was doing the Saturday show

1428
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,535

1429
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815

1435
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
Maybe I'll accept

1436
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
I started working with her years

1437
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:58,367

01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,071
This is a great example of how crazy the last 4 years

1495
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:18,399
I'd completely forgotten that right before the election Rodger

1496
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:22,239
Firestone was involved in a lawsuit where he was accused of engaging in voter intimidation

1497
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,263
Due to his work with the

1498
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
The Super PAC called

1499
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
Stop the steel

1500
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
Completely forgot that as well

1501
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
On its own this story is Mass

1502
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
The chaos that was going on at

1503
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
Just faded into the background

1504
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,063
Rodger was running stopped the steel is a nonprofit that was set up

1505
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
To conduct exit polls

1506
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,159
Some cities which had according to the Huffington Post quote

1507
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,951
High minority population

1508
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,023
Can you exit poll with extreme prejudice

1509
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:49,887
The group was really nothing more than a website where people could register as a volunteer poll Watchers

1510
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Go to the polls

1511
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,775
Presumably talk to voters and then enter the information they gathered on to this website

1512
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,615
The argument was that any election that was more than 2% off from eggs

1513
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,407
Bowling should be considered suspicious

1514
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
So what

1515
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,967
His group was intended to do is create

1516
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:08,575
Completely nonsensical non-scientific exit poll data to yell about after Hillary won

1517
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
That's what the scam was he

1518
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:14,463
Create a narrative on the back of meaningless information that you

1519
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,487
Who created yourself

1520
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:22,143
Rodger even said that the plan was to gather information to use as a challenge to the election in the case that is data didn't

1521
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
At what was Comic-Con

1522
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,959
But that's nonsense

1523
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
Even if his data wasn't

1524
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,311
Completely unverifiable and wasn't biased as hell in

1525
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
Complete trash

1526
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,895
He couldn't use it as a basis to challenge the election

1527
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,943
The only real outcome of this is

1528
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,015
To create something to rile up your followers after you lose

1529
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,551
This is a loser

1530
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,599
Strategy not a path towards winning

1531
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,671
The Huffington Post article on this is hilarious

1532
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
And the part about

1533
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,511
Stop the Steel's website is a personal favorite of mine

1534
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:52,351
Quote any registered volunteer could sit at home and start entering

1535
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
False information today

1536
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,239
HuffPost entered by votes Wednesday for Green Party nominee Jill Stein

1537
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
I vote

1538
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:02,847
Search for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and libertarian nominee Gary Johnson

1539
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Had two votes

1540
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
GOP nominee Trump

1541
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:09,759
In looking into it they just entered. Kaiser Rogers in bulshit

1542
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,551
Wow

1543
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,903
Rodger was almost certainly using the Super PAC as way to move money around

1544
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,207
As Mother Jones reported in 2018 that

1545
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,279
Pitstop Bastille strangely paid approximately $5,000

1546
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
Consulting fees

1547
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:26,911
Do the mother of stone associate Kristin Davis the Manhattan madam

1548
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,727
The mother has no experience

1549
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,519
In politics or elections

1550
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,799
I'm so this seems weird

1551
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
According to Mother Jones

1552
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
Quote in a text message

1553
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,943
Stone said he was too busy to answer stupid questions like this

1554
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,735
He did not respond to further question

1555
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:48,159
All this is super weird because after he got sued over this group he claimed quote I did not establish Sophos Vito I do not

1556
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,231
I control this bank account or It Anyway manages affairs

1557
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,815
Hard to square that with payments to his friend's mom was no business

1558
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
Consulting for the pack

1559
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,887
And also payments. Over Rogers

1560
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:04,287
It was people doing impressions of him online

1561
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,335
Just before the election

1562
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,895
Stop the steel spent it sent out new Direct

1563
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:13,759
Consider volunteers that made it clear that they cannot do things that violate voting rights law

1564
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Princeton

1565
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
You can't enter a polling place

1566
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
Devote

1567
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,671
You can't speak to anyone within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place

1568
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,463
You can't record anyone

1569
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,231
You can't talk

1570
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,767
To anyone about anything but

1571
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
Before they vote

1572
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
These rules are basically fly in the face of

1573
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,143
To the Blustery talk it was coming out of the group before this

1574
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,703
And it kind of feels like a cover-your-ass kind of thing

1575
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:38,591
Did Ronald up everybody about the need to protect the pole so it doesn't matter if you send out an email that's all like

1576
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,151
Control yourself that day before the election

1577
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
The desired effect has

1578
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,479
And then you can

1579
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,247
Do that

1580
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,527
You can say that tell you're trying

1581
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,319
How to get everyone to follow voting laws

1582
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,623
How can you possibly be held responsible for the action

1583
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
Volunteers

1584
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,719
You sent out an email telling them to follow the rules

1585
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,255
We've spent two months

1586
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,839
Describing all of the things that they shouldn't do

1587
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,631
In repeated

1588
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,423
Angry tones of voice

1589
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,983
They misunderstood that

1590
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,031
To mean those are the things that they shouldn't do

1591
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Going to do with that

1592
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,639
It appears to me that this is

1593
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,431
Like exactly what it appears

1594
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:19,295
It looks like an entity that was used to direct money to Associates will also hopefully suppress

1595
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Open some of the vote

1596
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Possibly creating chaos

1597
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
Fun places

1598
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,719
The ultimate payoff whoever is just the creation of a meaningless data

1599
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:31,327
So you can pretend if credible the proves that even though Hillary won the election your guys secretly want

1600
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,655
It's a long con type of thing where you're protecting your grip

1601
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,679
For the next stage

1602
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,983
This is not the action of somebody whose intent

1603
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,263
Going to win

1604
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,055
Because even if Rodger was

1605
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,871
I like using this as a strategy to help Trump

1606
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,151
You couldn't

1607
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:45,919
Lake

1608
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,967
Even if he got the best

1609
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,991
Best data pause

1610
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,831
Possible sure this blog post

1611
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,623
This would not

1612
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,903
What's way anyone's

1613
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
Opinion

1614
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,023
In a legal framework about the validity of the election

1615
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
Is useless

1616
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,071
Except

1617
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,095
Is it means

1618
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:08,959
Making War propaganda narrative propaganda is only useful if Trump loses

1619
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,519
Do you have to go through all this

1620
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:15,103
Trouble unless you're looking for a way to after-the-fact

1621
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,895
Dismiss

1622
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
The claims that you're a loser

1623
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,759
Sure I I mean I would also probably argue that

1624
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,575
You know if you are setting up a super packed

1625
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,599
To move money around

1626
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,391
Hidden ways

1627
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,927
That's just sort of a side

1628
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,231
Suspicion I'm not entirely sure that okay

1629
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:35,583
Alright 100% what was going on in the almost

1630
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
Reverse

1631
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:41,727
Baby sitting up a thing to move money around and he's like well we have to have a reason for the thing to a

1632
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Exist

1633
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,519
So

1634
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
This is fine

1635
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,335
You know maybe the madam

1636
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,383
Her mother was like stuffing on

1637
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
Let me call the consul

1638
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,711
Sure maybe it's not

1639
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
I don't know

1640
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,551
Sure anyone imagines

1641
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,087
Was just really taken care of

1642
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,903
You know you threw her that little bone she's on a fixed

1643
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,183
The income music

1644
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,231
Has nothing to do with that Manhattan Madam's

1645
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,535
Well I mean Kristin Davis

1646
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,839
A long time

1647
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
But like

1648
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:13,215
The thing that I just can't get around is like

1649
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
Thinking of

1650
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
How

1651
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,055
This would be something you would do

1652
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
If you were looking

1653
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,359
Productive ways

1654
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,639
Is to help Trump win

1655
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
Or

1656
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,943
Try to protect

1657
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,967
The whale

1658
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
Potentially

1659
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
I contested

1660
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,831
Do nothing

1661
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,415
Pointless except as a PR kind of strategy

1662
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,743
And to me that is an indication of something kind of strange

1663
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,791
Also

1664
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,839
He's not doing that this time

1665
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:46,239
No Rogers not doing this time now they have regular illegal poll Watchers now Rodger thought there was some

1666
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,543
I'm kind of like a real need for

1667
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,591
This thing that he did last time

1668
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,151
Like if there is a real concern about

1669
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,431
About the polls

1670
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,967
You think that you would be

1671
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
Trying

1672
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,039
Because

1673
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
I think you

1674
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,367
Wants Trump to win this time

1675
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,927
I'm not positive these people actually even walked up to it

1676
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,511
I'm starting to come around to the conclusion

1677
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,559
That these people are expecting a loss

1678
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,839
Yeah and they're bracing

1679
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,863
Sing for a loss

1680
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,167
Anyway for their business to move forward

1681
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
After that

1682
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:22,079
That's kind of the way all of this field that I believe that

1683
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
I'm starting to feel that way

1684
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:27,199
It's because Alex is declaring Victory no matter what happens in the twenties

1685
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,479
16 election

1686
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
He's doing now

1687
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,039
But

1688
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,319
In 2020

1689
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,599
He's saying that

1690
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Either

1691
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:39,231
Trump is going to win or Biden's going to win and it's going to be stolen and Trump actually watch

1692
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,815
Alex is declaring Victory no matter what is

1693
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,095
Is different in 26

1694
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,959
Whether he wins or loses this election

1695
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,311
Use a total winner he had courage

1696
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,103
You had courage you've taken action

1697
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,127
Globalism

1698
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,479
He's on the table as a crony capitalist anti-free Market Mafia system

1699
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,551
Screwing us over to use the fat

1700
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,087
Our borders are being dissolved

1701
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
Political correctness

1702
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
This is a guy who's making the argument that even if Hillary ends up winning which of course it'll be shenanigans

1703
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,583
Whatever

1704
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,167
Even if she wins we win because of morals and some has been

1705
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,959
Put on the table

1706
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:27,103
Trump has been such a dick and so rude the political correctness is gone

1707
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,223
Like this is someone who's like trying to look for the silver lining of the Trump losing

1708
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
Yeah

1709
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,783
It feels like that

1710
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,575
Very strongly

1711
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,647
As I go back and I look at this and maybe it's the

1712
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,927
Position of how out of

1713
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
Controller

1714
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
Desperate

1715
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,279
He seems for Trump to win now Shore

1716
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,351
I don't know it it's it's

1717
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,399
It's very different than I expect

1718
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Did I expect it

1719
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,447
To hear a lot more like

1720
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,543
Really desperate screaming a lot of like

1721
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,847
Pleading almost

1722
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,615
And I

1723
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
Here

1724
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,455
Barely covered resignation

1725
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,247
The desperate attempt

1726
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,551
To turn Hillary Clinton into the greatest villain

1727
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,831
Which is pointless

1728
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,855
If Hillary loses

1729
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Right

1730
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Yeah

1731
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,583
All of this I mean we're seeing why we're seeing how pointless it is now seeing as how they're still trying to run against Hillary and

1732
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:23,679
Behaviors that are going on

1733
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
Total sense

1734
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:28,543
If you're gearing up for the next election against Hillary

1735
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,335
Again if you're over here looking

1736
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:35,711
For four more years of fighting against Hillary washer doesn't make a ton of sense

1737
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:39,039
If you think that you're going to have to deal with Trump for the long-term

1738
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,063
Right

1739
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:45,183
Trump works really well with the way that they're playing this as a prop that goes away

1740
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
Like

1741
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,255
A Ron Paul run

1742
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,023
Or whatever

1743
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,583
It doesn't it doesn't make sense to me and I know

1744
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,607
I know that I'm jumping

1745
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,399
To conclusions a little bit based on

1746
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
Bali full data set

1747
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:01,567
You know I'm I am just looking at a couple of days worth of his show sure but it is the overwhelming sense that I get

1748
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,591
Bike

1749
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
He doesn't

1750
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:07,967
Yeah I mean I imagine that makes sense though because we

1751
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,015
This time we spent six

1752
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
Six months being repeatedly hammered with

1753
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,671
Fivethirtyeight back when everybody thought that was a great thing that gave

1754
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Buying likes

1755
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:21,791
And 85% Hillary like a 75% chance of winning

1756
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,375
I feel like over and over again everyday there

1757
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
Forced to like

1758
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
There's only

1759
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,239
The betting money says our guys going to lose

1760
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
You know

1761
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:35,615
And now even though we're dealing with the same type of care about that

1762
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,919
Secret Pole

1763
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,455
Secret polos

1764
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,759
A call back whenever life was reasonable

1765
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,319
Alex doesn't understand how pole is work

1766
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,599
No that restrain statistic

1767
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,647
Fix it all at sampling sizes.

1768
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,439
Do you understand

1769
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,743
Novi.

1770
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,583
Sidestroke Barnes won a lot of money on the election

1771
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,631
So

1772
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,935
Rodger as a prediction that did not

1773
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,263
I presumed

1774
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,287
Between the election

1775
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,503
I didn't happen

1776
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,551
Imagine that

1777
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
If Trump loses

1778
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:19,391
Between now and the inauguration Trump

1779
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Full pardon

1780
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,207
Everybody who's committed a crime ever

1781
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,511
I think we might all get a clean fight

1782
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,095
Officer Rodger has a little bit of a bone to pick

1783
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
Here

1784
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
What happened

1785
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,703
Just before this episode was

1786
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,751
Bat alley

1787
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
Somebody else gun

1788
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
In the audio

1789
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
And Secret Service

1790
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,639
Just came and then I was surrounded Trump

1791
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,711
I want to watch that video Trump looks very good

1792
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,503
Adidas Nazi

1793
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:48,575
Stoic will say that he is very Story song

1794
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,927
Now some people might have been

1795
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
Suggesting at that point

1796
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
That this was staged

1797
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
In order to get

1798
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
Get sympathy for Trump

1799
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,071
Rodger does not care for this

1800
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,399
Metropolis care last night briefly

1801
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,191
Albion Nevada

1802
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:08,543
Democratic party dog

1803
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:13,151
What is the point of screaming Gunn Gunn and then running a truck just make him look weak or something

1804
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
Joe Biggs

1805
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,855
Flashlight on

1806
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,439
Within seconds of this happening

1807
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,999
Are we counted over 400

1808
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,047
Screaming Mimi

1809
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,327
Rodger Stone

1810
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
Stage this

1811
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
2

1812
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
This is some serious

1813
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
Ocean Wonderland

1814
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,567
In the present-day you have

1815
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,151
Gretchen Whitmer the governor of Michigan

1816
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,175
Who is

1817
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,199
Yuno gasai

1818
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,783
The subject of a kidnapping plot that Alex says

1819
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Was done

1820
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,391
Empathy for her which is Alice in Wonderland

1821
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
According to Rodger

1822
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,951
Also the other thing I find

1823
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,487
Incredibly fascinating about this

1824
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Is that

1825
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
When it's

1826
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Trump

1827
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:06,399
The plot is Democrats doing it to make him look weak

1828
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,935
African Spirits correct

1829
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
When it's

1830
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,471
Whitmer

1831
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
It's

1832
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,519
I don't know if

1833
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
The intelligence

1834
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,336
Agencies doing this to get her sympathy

1835
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,432
Spell the word Democrats are really good at false flag

1836
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:23,808
We can turn them into whatever we want I guess that's what we do right

1837
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
Or it's

1838
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,624
Just Alex makes all this s*** up

1839
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
In slightly different way

1840
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
2

1841
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,840
I think Rodger

1842
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
Kauai difficulty pointing out

1843
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,680
That they were 400 tweets with insects

1844
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,704
Makes me feel like

1845
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
He did do a

1846
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,312
Rodger feel like

1847
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,640
Seconds after this happened 400 tweets came out

1848
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:54,528
And they were the ones who knew what I did or I run 400 Twitter accounts and

1849
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,344
Sympathy for myself

1850
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,392
Apparently Trump is pretty

1851
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,416
Fatalistic

1852
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,464
This gets Alex really excited

1853
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,792
But I wanted to get to this

1854
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,584
Cuz he told me stop

1855
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,144
Call come out

1856
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,424
And the fact was

1857
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,448
Couple years ago

1858
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
Trump won going to run

1859
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,752
He knew what would happen

1860
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:18,848
But he just finally said okay I'll just found my life over

1861
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,384
It doesn't matter in his wife back

1862
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
Baby killed

1863
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,736
And stone just let it slip so I brought it up

1864
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,016
Of how committed

1865
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:26,784
Trump is

1866
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,576
So this is Steve stuff

1867
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:32,160
This is all like Icees I recruited

1868
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,464
Trump Quran with this group of

1869
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,768
Of good guy is in the intelligence

1870
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,048
Southside

1871
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:43,424
Which is why when the reasons why I was excited to hear that Steve was going to be on and then when he didn't show up I got confused

1872
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,008
I wanted to hear some more of that stuff

1873
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,544
But yeah so

1874
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
Rodger says the

1875
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,896
The Trump has very fatalistic about this

1876
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
Like Alex is a

1877
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:58,528
Inside baseball

1878
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,320
He doesn't even wear a bulletproof

1879
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,208
Talk about you said fatalistic

1880
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,792
Did they can't even make him wear a bulletproof vest he just doesn't even care

1881
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,072
This is so presidential

1882
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,912
So damn hot

1883
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,752
Slowing down

1884
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,872
His family has begged him to take more security

1885
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,248
That is so manly

1886
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,040
You calling fatalistic.

1887
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Fox

1888
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,392
Another word

1889
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
Have to do this

1890
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
I have to do this

1891
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:45,632
Is the opposite of a coward

1892
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,168
I love

1893
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:47,936
That

1894
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:54,336
Alex is trying to do this like always so manly won't wear a bulletproof vest

1895
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
Remove or add that I'm not flattering to his figures

1896
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,040
To just wither under the

1897
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,064
Keke Samantha

1898
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
Alex is trying to

1899
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,720
Push this now

1900
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,280
Trump is ready to die for the country

1901
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,816
Which is not

1902
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Foremost

1903
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
It is not at the

1904
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,424
The front of Alex

1905
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,192
His reporting

1906
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
And it's

1907
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,056
It's coming in a tiny bit here but it's weird

1908
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
It's not now

1909
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:29,152
They're not fully committed to this as something that has being

1910
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:29,920
Discuss the lot

1911
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,944
You know

1912
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,224
For somebody

1913
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Who believes

1914
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,272
Pet

1915
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,344
Hillary Clinton is working for the literal Christian

1916
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
Devil

1917
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
In 26

1918
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:39,904
16

1919
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:44,768
You would think he would be far more insistent that everyone get out and vote and not

1920
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Verite

1921
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Kind of like

1922
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
He's probably not going to win

1923
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,776
Christian devil

1924
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,568
Kind of voting 1808

1925
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,848
Almost

1926
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:03,200
Entirely vote against Hillary

1927
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,344
Like this little stretch with Rodger where Alex is excited about the idea that Trump doesn't wear a bulletproof vest and he's ready to die

1928
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,624
Or whatever

1929
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,160
And I think largely that's the

1930
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,440
Just motivated by

1931
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:16,768
The conversation about what happened at the rally tonight

1932
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,608
It's very little positive about Trump

1933
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,632
As much as it is

1934
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,704
Supremely negative about Hillary

1935
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,472
Man

1936
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,520
How did we go from there

1937
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
Trump is God King

1938
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:33,152
Yeah it's weird to make the hard-right love you so much they want you to be

1939
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
Peking

1940
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,456
It's for you to piss off the live

1941
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
Not bad

1942
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,784
Rodger gone

1943
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
And now Alex

1944
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:44,416
Continues at a little bit more talking about how great Trump is

1945
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,440
It's not

1946
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
It's not the biggest deal

1947
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,792
High-level groups who come to Trump and they know he's ahead

1948
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,096
And I said just work with us

1949
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,912
And we will let you in he said I

1950
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,192
Serve the American people

1951
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,728
This happened yesterday

1952
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,848
Yesterday

1953
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
Crapping your pants

1954
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,688
They came to Trump May 7th

1955
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,712
The Deep state

1956
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,016
The older elements

1957
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,296
Bush connect

1958
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
And they said just

1959
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:14,880
Say you'll work

1960
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,952
So you listen.

1961
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,768
Will

1962
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,072
Let you win if you are the winner

1963
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,376
Donald Trump told him no

1964
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,728
American people

1965
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Grab side

1966
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:31,776
And they said

1967
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Okay buddy

1968
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,616
Okay

1969
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,664
That was a warning last night

1970
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,016
I got to go I got a gun

1971
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
You just stood there and waited

1972
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
Now you didn't he look

1973
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,488
Pretty confused that's that's what I would say video

1974
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,768
Justice like a woo

1975
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,400
I don't know I mean like what now it's is trying to do here is just like a

1976
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,936
Half-cooked version of

1977
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,472
Like this

1978
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
This doesn't

1979
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,032
Sounds like he's even convinced

1980
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Have any of this

1981
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:11,200
Grasping at straws like what kind of

1982
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,224
Do it sometimes

1983
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,320
Hey hey we're blackmailing you were going to install you in the office

1984
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:19,904
75% of the time do whatever you want to get it out of there

1985
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,208
Considered

1986
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,768
Water be at we want to seat at the table

1987
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:31,168
Of the office we're literally giving to you I don't always need my way I do know to know you

1988
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,472
You heard me it is a very touchy

1989
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,544
She feeling kind of overwhelming

1990
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,872
Is viren pulling out these like

1991
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:44,480
Your pants if you knew how real this was

1992
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
Really

1993
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Yeah it is

1994
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,320
To me just seems like Alex and

1995
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,088
That isn't

1996
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:53,952
He's not fully developed this ability to

1997
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,768
Lionize Trump in the way that he

1998
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,304
Become accustomed to now

1999
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:04,448
IM and maybe it's a lack of development of the scale maybe it's an ambivalent to just seems very flat

2000
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,080
So we have 11 morghast here on November 6th

2001
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,616
And the guy who's very

2002
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
Concerned

2003
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,664
About widgets

2004
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,224
LOL

2005
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,320
Larry Nichols shows up here on November 6th

2006
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,368
Something that this this is

2007
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,160
The story that I've heard Larry Talib

2008
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,744
Before and let's hear it again. It's a good one

2009
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,656
I literally had to go to

2010
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,216
Winter

2011
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,440
TV local TV station

2012
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,768
Church every Sunday

2013
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,864
Who is Santa Cruz

2014
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,704
Tony told me 20 years ago years ago

2015
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:19,200
She got all that she turned away from me

2016
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,296
Joker steps

2017
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
She said

2018
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392
You know I can't do that

2019
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,184
Andrea background

2020
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:34,816
Walkaway

2021
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,936
Love that story

2022
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:46,336
Hillary Nichols just going to Hillary being like we just need you to pretend to be into Jesus

2023
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
You know I

2024
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
Why can't you that Noah

2025
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
Why couldn't you

2026
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,272
If you are like

2027
01:28:54,528 --> 01:29:00,672
The devil is the king of lies right

2028
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:04,256
Not there are a lot of Arcane rules that make sense

2029
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,536
Ewe

2030
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,816
Contacts I don't know

2031
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,608
I feel like if you are

2032
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,632
I didn't

2033
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:14,240
Who's trying to take over the country to somehow stop Alex from doing something

2034
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,312
You'd be able to pretend that

2035
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,152
MR2 had a good time

2036
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,176
I cannot

2037
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:24,736
Considering she's been to church

2038
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,040
Plenty of time

2039
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:33,184
I probably wouldn't play that clip again because he's told that story Bunch times but invented to Alex

2040
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
Yeah half remembering sauce

2041
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,328
It was in mainstream News Washington Post

2042
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,096
As well

2043
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,912
But she does he sounds for Dad and liberals will be there

2044
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,752
If you can call it the dead Hillary's you just getting them broke down at the first level D called

2045
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,568
Can we talk to Jesus and she says that's the one per

2046
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
We don't talk to

2047
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,992
You know I can't do that you told me that 20 years ago

2048
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,272
Decade ago

2049
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,552
The Washington Post

2050
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,320
They were like

2051
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,856
Oh she does stay on

2052
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,648
Who was she talked to will not

2053
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,416
Jesus

2054
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:10,048
Talk to anybody but Jesus what is that mean he is a veritable

2055
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,680
Hold on

2056
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:19,776
I thought we'd be better if they could actually contact

2057
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:26,176
Juve Isaiah throw everything that Alec beliefs into turmoil does sort of imply that a lie

2058
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:32,576
Believe these seances work at Jesus's getting snow

2059
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,600
Rude

2060
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,392
Baby pigs that what it is

2061
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
I guess

2062
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,512
What their matter at all you're not going to talk to Jesus here

2063
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:46,912
I'm too good for Jesus yes Alex's timelines a little bit off here he saying that Larry told him about this 20 years ago and then

2064
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,960
10 years ago is in the news

2065
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:55,104
And that's that's not true book written by Bob Woodward back in 1996 years ago

2066
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,640
In the book it

2067
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:02,784
It's claimed that Hillary would have quote imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi

2068
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,320
As a therapeutic release

2069
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:10,208
In 2016 Bill Clinton gave a speech at the dedication of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Four Freedoms

2070
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:14,560
Park in which key you mentioned the exercises that Hillary did pretending

2071
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,584
Speak to Eleanor

2072
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,168
As a way of helping her cope with her new responsibilities as first lady

2073
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,752
This video was taken and used to resurrect the talking point that Hillary speak

2074
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,824
To the dad and engages in demonic rituals with Alex to again

2075
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,384
As for the part about Hillary not talking

2076
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,152
The Jesus

2077
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,968
From a CNN article about Woodward's book

2078
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,784
Quote the first lady declined a personal advisor

2079
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,320
Suggestion that she address Jesus

2080
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,344
Is Christ however

2081
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,624
Because it would be quote

2082
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
Too personal

2083
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,672
According to Woodward's book

2084
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,440
The choice

2085
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,488
Is outrageously thin soup

2086
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,536
This is just kind of like

2087
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,096
I mean I don't know I've been in therapy and you talk

2088
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,400
Do like your younger self or like

2089
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,192
Dead relative

2090
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,216
You do like a

2091
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:53,984
Cathartic

2092
01:31:54,240 --> 01:32:00,384
Sure thing where you talk about some memory I don't know that you need to get out and you don't have the ability to it

2093
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,664
It's something that people do

2094
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
I can I find it

2095
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,736
Completely plausible

2096
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:05,504
Like

2097
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,528
Hilary wood

2098
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:12,928
Have a conversation am a giant with Eleanor Roosevelt and now he's in the same

2099
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Roll eyes

2100
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:16,000
Right total census of b*******

2101
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,816
I think what boggles my mind never boggles my

2102
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,608
Because it's always out

2103
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
Spud

2104
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Reagan

2105
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,960
Literally made Polly just post

2106
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
See decisions

2107
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,264
Based on an astrology

2108
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,848
Like a personal astrologer

2109
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,872
Who they would ask

2110
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Policy Quest

2111
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:35,200
And then make decisions based on that

2112
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,736
Yes but like weave

2113
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,504
Witches

2114
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
Well you're prob

2115
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:46,720
Jesus did they did they snub Jesus with the astrology

2116
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:50,560
Linda bloodworth-thomason

2117
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,584
Witches

2118
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:55,168
So we won last clip here and keep this

2119
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:58,240
As a nice way to push back against

2120
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,288
What's the folks

2121
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,080
I've gotten a little bit of feedback.

2122
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:05,152
People were little soft on Larry

2123
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,944
Because

2124
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,736
Remembering

2125
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:15,136
In him or whatever

2126
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:19,488
The only thing that I want to be careful about

2127
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,512
Is

2128
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,560
I am fine with

2129
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:28,448
Remembering his history and being like f*** you you sure

2130
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:33,056
What did the occasion of his death to be the reason we would do some

2131
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,080
And so

2132
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,128
Yeah maybe

2133
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,664
Maybe a little bit soft

2134
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,944
If only two

2135
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,224
Not be mans

2136
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,528
Stress in in presentation

2137
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,856
No interest in turning him into any figure whose

2138
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,880
Not a complete

2139
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,440
Creating a horrible Tok

2140
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,208
Mexican fluent

2141
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,744
On everything

2142
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,048
That matters

2143
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,072
It's weird for us

2144
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
2

2145
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
It like

2146
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,680
We should probably be be

2147
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,448
Graded on a

2148
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,496
As far as

2149
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:08,896
What's the same thing with reverence go like everybody we talked about would be fine if they all went into an incinerator like

2150
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:14,016
They're all awful people with very few exceptions

2151
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,344
Yeah exactly

2152
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,488
What you talking about earlier the you like Hillary is demon in this is Alex's

2153
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:29,888
Is kind of mild

2154
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,448
Yeah there's there's

2155
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:37,056
There's an understood these people suck

2156
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,384
Just to be perfect

2157
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,920
Quickly Fair

2158
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:42,944
A whole lot

2159
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
Okay

2160
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,904
Last chance

2161
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,744
The media has made it Rachel eBay

2162
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:02,400
That's right he literally made it racially-based like that what do you mean

2163
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,984
They'll never get to vote again

2164
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,128
Conservative

2165
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,664
All white people who are

2166
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,016
Super invested in their whiteness you better because otherwise

2167
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
Literally right now

2168
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:23,392
Everybody was not awake conservative better f******

2169
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
Vote

2170
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,816
You're the new Larry Nichols

2171
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:35,424
You hear stuff like that and it's like yeah okay Larry I got you

2172
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,728
I hear what you're saying

2173
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,264
Yeah put it down

2174
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:44,896
Stretched be really interesting

2175
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
Andrea Lee

2176
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,968
Not what I expected at all

2177
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,248
No I found it

2178
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,016
Boobie Miles

2179
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,808
From a desperation

2180
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,576
Standpoint

2181
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:56,160
But also not in the way of like we've got this in

2182
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
In the bag

2183
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,744
There's still a like it if we lose we still want to

2184
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,768
Is globalism being

2185
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,536
Disgusting

2186
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,840
Frazee culture took a hit

2187
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,424
It's kind of like a we're flying if we lose

2188
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,984
Cuz our business is on the right direction

2189
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:14,336
We've created the talking points that we need an order I abstain gears

2190
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,128
Fighting a Hillary

2191
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,712
We've talked about her being a demon we might have to deal with that but

2192
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,272
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it

2193
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:25,344
I'm coming around 2

2194
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,904
The possibility that Alex did not want

2195
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:28,928
Or expect

2196
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,208
Which is not

2197
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,256
The framework I have

2198
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,816
Had for yourself

2199
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:37,120
Yeah there is a little bit of

2200
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
We had our

2201
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:44,032
You know like we had our fun with Trump he got to be a dick to everybody got to make fun of all the

2202
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,312
Non-white people

2203
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,848
We got our message out

2204
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,128
Which is f****** on white

2205
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
People

2206
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,664
And

2207
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,248
Now it's like okay now we have to go back to the way we used to act

2208
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,112
It's interesting to visit like you never really be able to really know what

2209
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
That's why because

2210
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,184
Alex will never be like

2211
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,720
Hey

2212
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,536
For Trump

2213
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,352
Never you have to be encouraged

2214
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:11,680
Using people to do the thing they will probably never work out

2215
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,960
Yeah

2216
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
Is not

2217
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,264
Your preferred out

2218
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,544
Company have to still

2219
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,848
Pushing that direction like Alex

2220
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,616
Never one

2221
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,664
Ron Paul's actually win

2222
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,992
You can never be like well it's time to give up on Ron Paul

2223
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
Invoke

2224
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
4

2225
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,576
Mitt Romney's telesales

2226
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,368
Then you know his consumers eat

2227
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,136
You can't

2228
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,464
Just force consumers to eat whatever it is you want them

2229
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,768
Do you have to sell them automatically want

2230
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
Young Voices

2231
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,584
Regular global

2232
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:47,520
That's the other thing too there was like really disappointing kind of is like looking back on like

2233
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,824
This is just about Marina Abramovic

2234
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,896
That's how you get to the demon stuff

2235
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:56,224
You're just misrepresenting a couple passes

2236
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,296
Stooges from Bill Clinton's book about him being into voodoo

2237
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,856
Hillary's into seances because

2238
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:04,416
She imagined talking to Eleanor Roosevelt

2239
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
Against rust

2240
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,464
It's just

2241
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
So

2242
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
Impotent

2243
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,560
In terms of like

2244
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:13,120
Having any legs to it there's no like

2245
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,144
The propaganda is Sophie

2246
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,168
Yep

2247
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
And it worked

2248
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
I mean

2249
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,520
I'm just I'm looking for things

2250
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
Games that are like

2251
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:26,944
Deeper and it's like now you just saw painting the freak you out it should be harder to end of the world

2252
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,736

2254
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296
Concrete

2255
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,832
To end the world on but hopefully

2256
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
Just do it with picture

2257
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,136
And do whatever he wants

2258
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,440
