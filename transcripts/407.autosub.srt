00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nike.com

I know this one out of left field is about enchiladas

6
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032

8
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872

00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
For this type of bird

10
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Purpose

11
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
Recording

12
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
I like this kind of

13
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
I'm not saying

00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,088
Did you start your first podcast I'm saying like when did you first like

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
I'm going to do this

16
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,184
I would have been back in Missouri probably 2000

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:42,656
When I was a much younger man

18
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Tudo radio

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Like have my own radio show and that wasn't a possibility

20
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Discover the park

21
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Was a thing

22
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
I wanted to try and do it

23
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
Early so there wasn't like any kind of

24
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,576
Who had to buy a microphone because I was trying to crack into voiceover work

25
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
You have to record your own little

26
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Addition

27
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Descend to the clients

28
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208

30
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
Stuff about Brickstone Tire

31
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216

00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,664
Up until the point that didn't that news broke

47

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
Yeah now it's a show

80
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
We're going over the beginning of last week

81
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Envy

Jumping on Thursday you're on March 5th because that is right when Alex

00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
As shaved

86
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Just head and

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
A big news

88
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
It is but he

89
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
He does not

90
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Want to talk about it

91
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
He doesn't have to talk about it I bet he will

92
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,943
Bring it up for quite a while since there was big old ball pit

93
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
He does actually start the

94
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Show on a very familiar note

95
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
Talking about the Coronavirus

96
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
Situation

97
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
In this out-of-context drop that we will play

98
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,023
He reveals that he meant to start the show talking about something out

99
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,399
Watercolor job interview out of a homeless person eating poop the drudgereport.com like to and I

100
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
I'm at the start the show other but I just ask

101
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
You meant to start the show with it

102
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Cool I don't want to start my morning

103
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,967
Like that no

104
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,807
That's what I'm mad at 11 now that's

105
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Like Tammy California

106
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Maybe

107
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
I don't know time zone

108
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
I know a lot about Alex Jones

109
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
Jordan

110
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Restart

111
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
So are we still here on the 5th

112
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
And this is how Alex actually does

113
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
Start off the show

114
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Talking about how

115
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,823
Maybe Mass hysteria around an outbreak maybe it's inevitable

116
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
When things happen like that

117
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Humans

118
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
You don't know where you are in some small town

119
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
Google what ubiquitous interviews

120
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Believe

121
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,863
Google that you actually about downfall scam

122
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Michigan or New York

123
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
See the restaurant

124
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
With lines out the door

125
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
Restaurants

126
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
The grand analysis

127
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
Restaurant

128
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,599
That's for cars and if I doubt there's a meth head running it and they're dealing drugs out the back

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,487
Creepy looking place there are so many great restaurants that are not crowded

130
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
Sometimes the greatest restaurants are the ones that you

131
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
Highway 22

132
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
Entirely sure what point he's trying to make it how can I

133
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Next but

134
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,799
I just take issue with this is my my favorite Thai places

135
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,407
Always

136
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
I think about people get takeout

137
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
Delivery but

138
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
If you went there you'd siakam

139
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
Completely empty dining area

140
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
If that

141
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Yeah so this is stupid

142
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Anyway Alex

143
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
Talks about this that Lansing

144
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Set study if you'll recall

145
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
Up to this point he's been using that that Lancet study that looked at just a couple of very extreme cases of folks

146
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,823
Already developed the virus into the pneumonia

147
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Stage and they were looking

148
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
King at a small subset

149
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Channel people

150
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
And they predicted

151
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
A 15%

152
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Mortality rate

153
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Excuse me not predicted

154
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
They said there was that a small sample size

155
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,439
Alex has been using that to say that Lancet was saying

156
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Bet the whole world

157
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
We're having 15% mortality rate

158
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Coronavirus

159
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
How it

160
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
It's interesting

161
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
He now knows what that study actually was about

162
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
Lancet had a limited thing 5 weeks ago

163
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,591
I'm just 47-8 at least 65 to get a decent reading

164
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
With the ones they had it was a

165
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
15% death rate yourself

166
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,271
Super sick and puts on a good Focus cribs

167
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Robert

168
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
I made it was 50% I would be in a bunker

169
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
Alex no nose

170
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
That he was a month behind on our show did he just where we explain that song

171
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Now he knows

172
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Which is important

173
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
Because he has that information inside his head

174
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Save this as a correct

175
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
Well I miss reported this I had that wrong sorry about that now you just now knows what that actually is

176
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
That's interesting

177
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Hold on to that for later

178
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,439
Okay from the virus and he starts talking a little bit about the

179
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
The Democratic

180
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
A primary

181
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
ESPN

182
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,095
Songs about the Biden being the presumptive nominee

183
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,399
He's just holding the front for gabbard

184
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
The come-from-behind right nope

185
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
But he is holding

186
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Confront for somebody

187
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
Hillary Rodham Clinton

188
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
What are they planning behind that you know

189
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
You do know that

190
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
Trying to sell Hilary Duff and then he

191
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
At the stroke

192
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
Presidents have had Woodrow Wilson

193
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
The Protestant world

194
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
An endorse Hillary because there's a

195
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
Hillary in the bureaucracy

196
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
She supposed to

197
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
I am taking over and everyone that he's left us Steel

198
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Believe

199
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
In

200
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Hillary so we'll discuss

201
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,407
All of that you still believe him because of Hillary

202
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Every single person

203
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Safe for Bernie

204
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
He has moozie's I go they're going

205
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
How to get in

206
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
He's all just

207
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
Just about Trojan horsing Hillary

208
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
Was going to make her the VP now Biden going to make a VP

209
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Before when it was the impeachment stuff

210
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,631
Lucy's going to get in make Hillary the VP she's going to tap Town Hill

211
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
These the one

212
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Those are playing along

213
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
The left

214
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,407
Really coalesced around Hillary Clinton after she failed miserably at that one

215
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
Stupid stuff to save it so there isn't any support for Hillary in awhile

216
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
This is outrageous

217
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
Stevie levels to it Alex wants to be fighting Hillary

218
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
You can't just be like all right

219
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
I'll critique her documentary or whatever

220
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
What's actually pretended to be

221
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
U-Hauls of power Eastside

222
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,055
So I could put a couple back you was talking about the

223
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Recycle Atlanta

224
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
5% mortality rate

225
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
I'm getting out

226
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Audi

227
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Right

228
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Insurance at Alex's Bates

229
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Preparations

230
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Personal

231
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439
God said the time has come before this I said I just

232
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
Feeling that things are dangerous

233
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Yet

234
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
A farmhouse

235
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
100 Balls around town

236
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,727
In the crappiest brush area where no one even knows where I'm at

237
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
You just loaded with horrible food

238
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
An underground safe with guns in it

239
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
So the unibody voxy got to check the Unabomber boxes in early March Alex doesn't have

240
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,487
Have that and a couple months ago he told a personal assistant to set this up for him

241
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,071
Which is weird because on January 31st this is what he said

242
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
I'm a father

243
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Got to be in charge

244
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
Future

245
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,239
Outside town

246
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
In 45 Acres with a

247
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Done saving food

248
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
Living in fear I'm living in powered

249
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
Do you have an armored out or do you not what is the deal

250
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
You know this situation I think it's

251
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
The good idea to save both

252
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,671
That's fair

253
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Exactly

254
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,767
If you don't people knowing that you have a redoubt what's the best way to hide it

255
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Tell them that you have a redoubt right

256
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Sears online

257
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,215
Yeah you got to keep the mystery in the air

258
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,335
For sure Alex has word out you don't believe it

259
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Maybe you'll leave him alone

260
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
Yeah

261
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
So I've made a bit of a point of the fact that Alex cannot pronounce the name of Brazilian president

262
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
Bolsonaro

263
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
I've made a little bit of a point of that

264
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,839
One thing I haven't made as much of a point of is how he also can't pronounce are.

265
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,935
You always pronounces it hurt again

266
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:33,311
Add so he gets a little self-conscious about the fact that he mispronounces erdogan's name

267
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
I offered

268
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,687
Play Islam assisted launch big invasions down face to in the euro

269
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Oregon

270
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Right behind it

271
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,367
Cause everytime whatever something Ready Gunner Sayre one

272
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Autocorrect

273
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,567
House is incorrect as is his supposed linguist

274
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Expert Daria

275
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,687
In Turkish the G is often pronounced with a soft W sound

276
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
Any correct way to pronounce the name of the turkey

277
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
The president is air Dewan

278
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,671
This actually was covered a bit in the news because when are lawn visited the White House in May 2017

279
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Truck caps

280
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Pronouncing it with

281
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
The G sound

282
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
And it cost a lot of folks to write articles

283
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Consulting with linguist

284
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
The Turkish experts

285
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,423
Guess what all of them said his name is pronounced aw

286
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Daria the Nets

287
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
True that's given them the wrong

288
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,823
Here's why she's not consulted all these matters

289
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
I think she knows

290
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
She's just like I'm not doing the bucket

291
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Forget it's early

292
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
That that goes to the show like the level of who gives a shift your right out

293
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:55,487
Nothing ever gets checked and it just things just keep proceeding onward down the dump Athens

294
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,887
Roads giveaways through the show and he hasn't made note of the fact that he shaved his dumb had yet and

295
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
He brings it up

296
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,263
But he refuses to say that he's bald or that he shaved his head

297
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
He's trying to tease the audience

298
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,383
By mentioning that his appearance is different

299
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
But he wants you to go like to his

300
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
D-zone website so you could see it for your

301
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
If you haven't seen a friend for a month

302
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
And they just show up with a mustache

303
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
And don't tell you about

304
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
All you're looking

305
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Adams just like

306
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Dude what's with the mustache

307
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
Tell me about the mustache

308
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
What I think is going on with Alex

309
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,887
Just trying to use the idea that

310
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
That you look something like something

311
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
Different to tease anyone who might be listening on shortwave or on the radio to go to his website

312
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Good going on

313
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,943
He just refuses to say the word balls cuz he's insecure or something

314
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,063
On this transmission

315
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
I wanted this morning and I said I kind of look like

316
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
A cute little Beluga

317
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
You could meet me do a cute little melodica

318
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,143
Things are so serious I got this morning and I said what can I do to note

319
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Everybody

320
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
That

321
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Pavarotti making jugs

322

I want some bellwether

328
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
I must look like a beluga cuz I already thought of myself

329
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Michael Greger

330
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Okay let's get serious

331
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Like

332
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
That sounded very serious

333
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
Yeah I think he's very seriously told the staff not to use them

334
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Please don't make a big deal

335
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Yes please

336
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
I hate to be fair I want to be clear

337
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
I think it doesn't look bad

338
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,791
I'm not going to be a dick about this be like I look you I mean I'm going to say this big dumb head

339
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,863
It'll take awhile to get used to but I don't think it'll

340
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
I could grow into it quite well

341
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
What you might be doing it

342
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Puppies not cuz

343
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311

Anyway Alex

346
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Talking about the virus news

347
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Coronavirus news

348
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
But it's too

349
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
It's absolutely too intense

350
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
How to get to Sol

351
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
He does what he does best

352
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Just pretend he's going to go to

353
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,487
Coronavirus so horrible so scary for me

354
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
That

355
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
David

356
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Not so hungry caterpillar

357
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Not getting into it by

358
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
A lot of people around the world

359
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
I want to know your take on it

360
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
Zoe goes to the cause

361
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
And this is one of the things you really should

362
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
Do you do a show like Alex's

363
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
Like if you're like

364
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
There's big

365
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Intense

366
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
Coronavirus news

367
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
That I need to cover

368
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
So I'm nibbling around like a caterpillar

369
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Instead what I'm going to do is go to the cause

370
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,631
Because you know what happens when he goes to the calzone shoes like this very insightful and Powerful things

371
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Loop it around APA

372
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,519
Is a very dumb things and he thinks they're really smart

373
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
As its first caller does

374
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Right now

375
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,431
We've already had Alex establish that he thinks of his like a race

376
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
Specific bioweapon

377
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
And now it turns out

378
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,087
Might also be age-specific as a biome

379
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Actually nervous

380
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Vista are what

381
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
What I think about

382
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
The coronavirus even on this show

383
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Directions

384
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
Lay it on me brother cuz I feel something

385
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Joe

386
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Day-Day keeps

387
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
Came that we shouldn't worry about it if we're young and healthy

388
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
The old p

389
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
People

390
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Compromised

391
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
People that should worry right

392
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
What is our largest

393
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
Unfunded liability in this

394
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
23

395
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Billion dollars in debt

396
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
And all I hear on the mainstream media

397
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
So yesterday

398
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Fox News their data.

399
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Doctor on meth

400
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Hey aiyuk

401
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Get this thing you should do

402
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
Unless your old don't worry about it

403
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Joe what would he

404
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Send it

405
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Bigots

406
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
Answer of wealth in the

407
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
Going to occur as

408
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
The older Generation X

409
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Generation pass

410
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
If the government was able to receive

411
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Some of that money

412
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
We have a huge

413
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Where this coronavirus Bang

414
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
And

415
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
You know I totally agree with you

416
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Government

417
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Bill Gates has set this

418
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Dogs and other events

419
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,495
You better

420
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,335
Cooking up a vaccine for it and who owns

421
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,943
The Chimera virus subgroup Bill Gates fun wow you just can't make that up

422
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Yeah you can

423
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Have you heard anyone say

424
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Say that yet and

425
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
Just to come out of my mouth

426
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
Disturbing Evan get up there

427
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,207
Closest is a video report

428
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Corona

429
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
Specific bio-weapon

430
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,863
To kill the elderly before they

431
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
Coronavirus short response

432
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
Targeting the elderly

433
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Mary

434
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
Reasonable statement because it's midnight thank you sir it's not man-made

435
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
This is how easy it is to get Alex to jump on something as like oh my God we're going to report this

436
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
There's a possibility

437
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
Oh God yeah

438
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
I guess

439
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,351
My my biggest feeling about that would be just like that is a demonstration

440
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
Tune of how loose

441
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
The gates are

442
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Whatever done thought you have

443
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
Alex is going to treat it as like oh my God yes

444
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,871
This is probably a beta test of an age specific bio-weapon

445
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
Allegory

446
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
I haven't heard anybody talk about

447
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Do you know

448
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
The first letter

449
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Virus do you know what that is

450
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
The V for Vendetta

451
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
No for Virgin

452
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,792
Specific bio-weapon where can I post this on website at the headline

453
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,352
Go out there and Foxy don't get the virus

454
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
Did you watch

455
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
Belugas

456
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,568
So Alex gets to the trend that goes on throughout some of

457
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
This time is now

458
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
Descended into a place where he's threatened

459
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,064
Coming to murder people if any of his family members get Coronavirus

460
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,368
And it begins here and I

461
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
This is maybe an imp

462
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Implicit or implied threat again

463
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
Obama

464
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Kind of girl

465
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
You may recall Alex believes that Obama

466
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
Sold the virus

467
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
Do the Chinese back

468
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
2015

469
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,264
Because he doesn't know how to read it makes Obama at fault for his family members

470
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
That's that's

471
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
That's how backtrack

472
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
Is it a coming back over and over again

473
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,272
This has an HIV delivery system but that wouldn't be enough

474
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,112
Got a whole bunch of different viruses together

475
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
But do different things

476
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
Yeah it's a nightmare virus

477
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Hit you

478
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,352
But no one wants to discuss that no one's supposed to talk about that

479
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
That's why I am so pissed

480
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,472
It's not a threatening thing to say but

481
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
You saw the blind

482
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,200
It's time to start holding certain people

483
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
Possible.

484
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Obama

485
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
That garbage in 2015 if I bring my coronavirus file place while three employees

486
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,304
I needed that

487
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,704
Leaving aside that I wasn't even at the most basic understanding of how HIV works I wanted

488
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
When he says it

489
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
Virus has an HIV deliveries

490
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,896
This is just him not understanding the difference between the furrion cleavage in the Ace to cleavage Scituate

491
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
In the past viruses like the Coronavirus

492
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,760
Those were taken in by the body through a stew

493
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Sites

494
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Weaving device

495
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
The Quirk of this one

496
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
According to that one report

497
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
That one study

498
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,232
I was at a to cleave with you if you're inside

499
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
Which is also true of hi

500
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,656
This is not the same thing as the coronavirus having HIV delivery system or anything like that

501
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,960
It's just a different way that things are absorbed

502
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Into the body

503
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
There are many things that use furin cleavage other than h

504
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
From the normal flute

505
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Ebola from dengue fever

506
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
The anthrax

507
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,504
I was just pretending that the coronavirus has something from HIV added to it

508
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
But in reality he just doesn't understand the topic

509
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
He's covering it all

510
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,624
Also there's literally zero evidence.

511
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
This coronavirus is man-made there's no evidence

512
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Ton of different viruses in one

513
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
That's all just a product valances demented imagination

514
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
He's reporting as fact to his audience

515
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
The article uses to prove that Obama sold the virus

516
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
The China Cruise literally nothing of the sort

517
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,776
When he says there's a big sister when Obama did

518
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,640
Did that what he's lying about is the fact that he found an article about 11 in North Carolina

519
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
Experimenting with giving a Coronavirus

520
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,760
Function in terms of that Ace to cleavage

521
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
And how there was a debate in the scientific

522
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Community by whether or not

523
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Experiments like that were ethical

524
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
He can provide literally zero evidence

525
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Support those claims that he makes

526
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
There was a big

527
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
About Obama selling the virus China because it never happened

528
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
It's a lie

529
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,984
That being said I think Alex is trying to threaten to kill Obama if one of his relatives dying of the coronavirus but he also doesn't want to say the

530
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,568
Is that might involve another conversation with a lawyer

531
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Yeah I would definitely

532
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
I keep that one choir

533
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Notes

534
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
Seems very easy to stick a uranium 12 some

535
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
Took zero time at all Friday like

536
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
Obama's uranium one let's move on it's his fault

537
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,720
Come on everybody look over here tingling and one of the things that you'll see over the course

538
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
These episodes

539
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:09,888
Is that there is a a crystallization of it down to just these blunt talking point

540
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
There's no debate about it

541
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,728
This is been determined this is

542
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Decided

543
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
And just like eight a dogged

544
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,080
Distance in repetition of it

545
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
So the audience just

546
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
Gets the sound bite

547
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
And you'll see that over the course of the

548
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Spots

549
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
He comes back

550
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
And

551
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Happy music

552
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Is it is

553
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Feeling good

554
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
The course you belong to

555
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
To the city

556
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
And I've noticed a trend of the Alex

557
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Can't not give a speech

558
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,560
Over that saxophone

559
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,632
How do you not give a speech over saxophone if you got the

560
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
I don't

561
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Dispute that it's

562
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
Very humid

563
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
You just it's like the siren song

564
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
You can't not talk about space

565
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
And like human destiny

566
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
Supposed to do stuff.

567
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Beat Deathstroke

568
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:17,472
List of all the cedar

569
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:27,712
AI machine

570
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
Nothing Hammer going to win and then

571
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,136
Next Level the transformation will be upon us

572
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,464
We belong the stars of God

573
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
From which we came

574
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,840
And that is where we'll go to camp

575
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,936
Star2star the universe

576
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
Before us is that wasn't Alex Jones

577
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,200
It looks like the racism and

578
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
Jesus everything that falls for that

579
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
Ramblin Rover saxophone about

580
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Our destiny is to

581
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,976
To the Stars

582
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,280
Wake up really really ready to go every board

583
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,352
Could do some time on the treadmill

584
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
Really get me pumped up

585
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,008
So Alex thinks another call and I don't know how to tell you

586
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
What what's going on here other than

587
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,360
I think this dude is super rude

588
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
So yes I was in Costco

589
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
Getting ready I went by a bunch of

590
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
For the paper into things before

591
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
Crotch really hurts and

592
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,464
Read my phone had to show going on sitting on my pocket so I could hear it I wasn't even headphones

593
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
And I

594
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
Free listening to who's that talking

595
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
At first I thought

596
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
We might get some slack but

597
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
Alex Jones

598
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,920
Your eyes. Wide open and she says I'm really I thought he was off the air

599
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Round

600
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,784
I told her I explained

601
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
Told her where to go she wrote down your band.

602
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
Wards.com

603
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
Alex Spence a knot

604
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,840
Insignificant portion of the show expounding on how the man and the globalist want everyone to think

605
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Think he's off the air

606
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
How do you stop

607
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,960
Everyday you meet people think that he's off their but then he tells them they can

608
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
Can still find a mundane forwards website and they're so happy to hear

609
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
This caller is what Kik

610
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
Fix that off that whole rant have a few thoughts

611
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
First

612
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Is it I don't care what you're playing

613
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
If you're walking around in the store listen

614
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
Things I headphones girl f****** a******

615
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
If it's music you're an a******

616
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
If the liberal talk show you're an a******

617
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
If it's Alex Jones

618
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,464
A man who's known to launch into rant about demons raping

619
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Children with little warning

620
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
You're a bigger

621
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:55,168
A****** family show that you're walking right it's like I'm playing on your phone

622
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
As you walk through the store

623
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
G******** video on the last show

624
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
You can't play that in public

625
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,016
No matter what this guy's story is about if it start at if it starts them casually mentioning that he was losing to Alex's Schodack

626
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Costco without headline

627
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
F*** this dude

628
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,672
Second there've been a lot of points made about her Panic buying with

629
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Things you don't need to

630
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,512
Panic buy is probably one of the more damaging things people can do right now

631
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,144
It's the disruption of the demand chain they can have just as many negative consequences as the supply chain disruption

632
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Can have

633
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:33,312
Based on this guy sent you stocking up on toilet paper I'm going to say that he was not engaging in responsible preparation

634
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
Sensibly stocking up on mountains upon Mountain

635
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,992
The toilet paper minuscule amount of stocking up on toilet paper

636
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
I don't know

637
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Leaving just like

638
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
Where the toilet paper be just a few rolls

639
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
I have no idea how much was buying but it's

640
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
It's not it wasn't a good

641
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
Finally and most

642
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
Importantly if you've been on air for

643
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
26 years and you've built up a fan base that

644
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
Do you like the sides you must be completely off Erica's you get

645
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
Kicked off social media something

646
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
Even exist when your career began

647
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Then I don't know what to tell you

648
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
Something is wrong with that fan base

649
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
Either they're so hopeless that they can

650
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,200
Can't find her s*** unless it's shoveled right in front of their faces

651
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
Or they didn't like you enough

652
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,784
Enough to seek you out once the YouTube algorithms work

653
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Constantly pushing your videos on

654
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
Either way that's not a solid fan base

655
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
And I wouldn't blame the globe

656
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,232
For that that's just a byproduct of making a dumb show

657
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
It attracts a fickle

658
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,096
Type of crowd yeah it turns out info Warriors are very

659
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Capricious in nature

660
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Nobody would have

661
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
Came back of it now as I was listening around the time Alex got banned from social media and key

662
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
He knew it was coming

663
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Right to prepare

664
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,896
He was promoting his newsletter

665
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,200
You trying to drive traffic to his own website and

666
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
I guess people just didn't follow

667
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,296
If all these people think that you were too

668
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Just off air

669
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
Yeah

670
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
I'm not into it

671
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
I mean

672
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,048
Just removed from like the first page to the second page of Google will do

673
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
Destroy anybody but a fanbase

674
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
She's going to be

675
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Like

676
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,216
If they over there

677
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Absolutely

678
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Anyway

679
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
Alex believe

680
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
That the CDC is doing so

681
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Some sort of a cover

682
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
If I understand correctly

683
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
The things that they did

684
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
Is try to make

685
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,648
Is that the coronavirus situation not seem very bad by not rolling out

686
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,744
MBA providing test make the numbers of cases lower

687
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,328
And then Trump wouldn't take it seriously and then they would

688
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
Put out all the test there be a ton of people

689
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
A ton of cases

690
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Trump look like a dick

691
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Brilliant

692
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Brilliant

693
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
Now in this neck I see no flaws

694
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
Alex

695
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,408
Kind of implies

696
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
I'm by Plies I mean directly says

697
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,040
The Trump is involved in this cover-up

698
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
Just not good

699
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
Killing members of Alex's family

700
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:00,256
He might be involved in the cover-up of the things that leads to Alex's notarized

701
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:06,656
Damn

702
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
But I think all this is beyond it

703
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
They're they're not sitting out there

704
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
Gas station

705
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,616
I know it's been really a smarty is tied into

706
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,480
A six-month-old a bunch of people

707
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:27,648
Steve pieczenik also the guy who said that he was patient zero of the Coronavirus

708
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,488
Himself himself. He's very good at

709
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Suspiciously

710
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,376
Not sure that you're with anyone else biotic

711
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
What an idiot

712
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,008
So there's a cover-up going on in that Trump is complicit

713
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,944
Alex of course has historically been against government cover-up on account of you know how the government shouldn't cover things

714
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
To cover this up

715
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
People go crazy

716
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
You and I

717
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Didn't know about

718
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
The cover-up butter regular

719
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,720
It's weird for him

720
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,024
To say make a statement like that like

721
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
The executive

722
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
Federal government

723
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,424
Engaged in a cover-up is putting people at risk

724
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
I understand why he's doing it it's totally cool

725
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,128
Hey Alex Jones 1995 Alex Jones

726
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,736
So we finally get to the point where Alex brings up that he has shaved his head

727
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Inside it turns out

728
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
He does sort of give Ariza

729
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
I'm like ready to get in a fight

730
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
That's

731
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,792
Symbolizes

732
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
He said you had some people don't grab your hair

733
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,008
Image of this is not normal

734
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,568
We're not normal Waters here we're in a war

735
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
You all know that as well

736
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
Play Dan hysteria Nono

737
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
You're concerned

738
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
Because our gut know something big going on

739
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
What is it

740
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,904
How is that not Hysteria

741
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,976
I shaved my head to give a

742
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,280
Typo metaphorical symbols

743
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
Literally in

744
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,680
Trench warfare grab my hair while we're fighting

745
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,776
Did everybody knows that it's coming from his gut

746
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
Rest area

747
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Comes from

748
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
We all know this heinous and there we go

749
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,808
Inconceivably why Alex shaved his head was to make him look like a soldier or something

750
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,160
Give another reason later in a white guy shaves

751
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,232
Because he's looking for a fight that usually doesn't go well

752
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah

753
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Don't like it

754
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,656
It's not good he gives another reason later that I actually think it's probably more believable and we'll get to that in a minute

755
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
Before we do though

756
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,240
Alex is going to take another really stupid color

757
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
First of all

758
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
One of the

759
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
After he's out there

760
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Mike

761
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
Concern is when the weather gets warm

762
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
Welcomes

763
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,904
Oh my gosh I can spread it it's awesome

764
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
What happens when you supercharge

765
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Mosquitoes

766
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
What the Coronavirus

767
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Hours

768
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Malaria

769
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Stella down I think

770
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
A race car

771
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,824
Call a******

772
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,896
Couple of assholes here

773
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,504
Get it so right now there's no evidence of mosquitoes

774
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,832
Can carry or transmit the coronavirus and there's a very good chance that it's

775
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Just not even possible

776
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
There's actually a good tea

777
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Teachable moment

778
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
Mosquitoes can transmit things like a bowl of malaria dengue fever

779
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,864
Primarily because those things can infect the mosquitoes themselves

780
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
The only thing that I'm a

781
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,216
Mosquito puts into a person when it bites them as their saliva

782
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
So no matter what

783
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,288
Blood they have ingested it doesn't matter

784
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
That's not what's going to get transmitted to the

785
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
The B person

786
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,920
This is because there's a 22 proboscis

787
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
It's the dopest keto uses

788
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
The feed on your blood

789
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
One tube is the intake tube that sucks your blood

790
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
And you don't get

791
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,112
Exposed to anything from that it's a one-way Street

792
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
The other tube is used to

793
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,464
Inject saliva that makes you like not feel the bite

794
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
The

795
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
Itchiness

796
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
Took this life of mosquitoes

797
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
The vector that you need to be

798
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
Concerned with for the potential of MS

799
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Mosquito-borne

800
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,728
This is one of the reasons that HIV cannot be spread by mosquitoes

801
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
They don't possess

802
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,568
The correct cells in their body to serve as hosts

803
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
With HIV

804
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
I'm surviving mosquitoes

805
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
And can't be transmitted through their saliva

806
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,784
Historically diseases in the coronavirus family such as Mercy

807
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Since ours

808
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
Those aren't things that are known to be spread by mosquitoes

809
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,464
At this point all experts I can find who have commented on the matter or uniform

810
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
The position that there's no evidence

811
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,792
Since right now that this is a vector of transmission

812
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
They were seen or are likely to see

813
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
Mosquito borne diseases are no joke though

814
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:58,240
And they're very serious threat ever live

815
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:03,872
Malaria is a lot of places very.

816
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
But this doesn't appear to be one of those Circle

817
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,480
Circumstances where mosquitoes are going to play a huge role

818
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
Obviously anything

819
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
Impossible but this caller what he's doing

820
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,464
He's just coming up with a horrible scenario thing what about that and Alex's there is like my God I love taking calls

821
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
Every time Alex

822
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,400
Scholars Khaled we get a nice little like Magic School Bus

823
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:33,056
Alright he came up with some terrible ideas now let's go inside the body and discover how it is that people actually

824
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,896
I knew this cuz I had a buddy of mine who's a doctor

825
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,456
You and I had a long conversation about it cuz I didn't know

826
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,832
Understand that whole thing of like why can't something be transmitted by mosquitoes

827
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
I'm grateful you explain it to me I had to come in here acting

828
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
My guy do whatever

829
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
But the issue here is

830
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,536
Coloring with Alex are doing is just like it's

831
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
Baseless fear

832
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,168
This is hysteria this is making a nightmare scenario

833
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Acting like there's any reason to think that this is

834
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
I don't think to be concerned back

835
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
Hysterical

836
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Alex

837
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
Hey Alex movies are predict

838
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,920
Programming have you ever seen the bird

839
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Oh

840
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Nothing

841
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
So this is a big one the Coronavirus

842
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
Earlier Alex said

843
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
That

844
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
Trump was involved

845
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
In the cover-up

846
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,608
And I kind of thought that that was just a straight thing he said

847
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Clearly here

848
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,984
This is not just something he said he thinks

849
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
The Trump is probably covering this up

850
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
March 5th Thursday 2020 242

851
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:49,088
Coronavirus is the big one so far

852
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:55,488
11 man made pretty total for your government using it to create hysteria and lockdowns

853
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:01,888
Play it down I understand why I can't fault him for it

854
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:08,288
The testing they are covering it up that's even in the news now and the left is using it against the president just like

855
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
We predicted

856
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
In that clip

857
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,200
You can hear it absolutely incoherent message Alex is trying to spread to his listener

858
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
Let's break this down

859
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Piece by piece

860
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,832
It starts with him saying that it's official the coronavirus has the big

861
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
It's a gigantic world event and the big one

862
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Whatever that be

863
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
It's man-made

864
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,536
Which it's not and the government is using it to create a stereo

865
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,072
So the hysteria is bad

866
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
Except Alex is running the shower he's allowing its guests

867
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
Declare that the virus is Airborne

868
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,728
Alexa call or say that everyone's going to get it from mosquitoes

869
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
And let's not forget that he had his science expert Mike Adams

870
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Come on his show and say

871
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
2/4 Humanity

872
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,432
There will only be lone survivors

873
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,040
So hysteria is bad but also the show is nothing but Hysteria

874
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,880
Yes then Alex says the Trump is engaged in in

875
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:00,512
Solicit with this government cover-up of the virus situation actually suppressing the countries testing capabilities

876
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,864
This is a literal government cover-up of a Public Health crisis that Alex is describing

877
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
He's as a canceled job for doing it

878
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
His idea is the Trump is trying to

879
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
Check the stock market

880
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
Apparently if that's

881
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
The justification anything can be done

882
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:18,432
Covering up a pandemic and allowing it to get worse putting the public at risk its okay

883
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,224
I was trying to protect money

884
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,296
That seems to be Alex's position important

885
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,416
Then Alex complains that the left is using this against Trump

886
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Just like you predict

887
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
So apparently if Trump is engaged in a

888
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,072
Conspiracy cover up it could literally kill Americans because he knows the

889
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:39,424
It's a bad stock market would make him look bad jeopardize his chances in the election

890
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
And the media dares point out the ways it is

891
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Is Administration

892
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
Has not responded well to the outbreak

893
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
The media is bad

894
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,896
This is a completely bootlicking authoritarian respect

895
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,248
In one Fell Swoop Alex is establishing the virus as a gigantic threat

896
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
He asserts

897
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
Trumpism

898
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,112
The American Health System for being able to deal with it appropriately

899
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,672
And if the media criticism criticizes him for it

900
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
They're bad

901
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
The cover-up

902
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Is good

903
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
The criticism is bad

904
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,096
This is over out in the open dictatorship

905
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
This is not

906
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
The end

907
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,240
He's covering it up in order to stop master

908
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Hysteria

909
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
Right correct

910
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:20,128
Because the reason the stock market will go down

911
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Psistaria

912
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
And Alex

913
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,480
Appreciate

914
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
And understands why Trump

915
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
What is covering it up

916
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
Anything's mesentery is bad

917
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,392
And he is also spreading message

918
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,720
He doesn't seem to have a real consistent position or what

919
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,048
Hysteria at

920
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
The struggle

921
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
These words

922
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
So here on the 5th

923
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,936
Alex has

924
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Francis Boyle

925
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Come back on

926
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
His bio lab

927
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
So

928
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,991
Francis Boyle shows his Bona fides

929
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
And is

930
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,575
Resistance to reading

931
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
By indicating

932
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,439
But he believes that that North Carolina Lab at the UN

933
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,511
NC Chapel Hill created and then Obama sold

934
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
So that's great and then

935
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,983
Join Stewart Roads in the group of people who are erroneously saying that this is Airborne

936
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
Yes I do think

937
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Like this was offensive

938
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
Logical

939
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
Warfare

940
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Weapon

941
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
That was originally developed

942
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,271
Up there at the University of North Carolina lab

943
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
Using the

944
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,183
SARS coronavirus which was already weaponized

945
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
To begin with

946
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
And enduring it with game also

947
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Ocean

948
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,399
Indeed it even travels through air

949
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Alex is not just

950
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
The question

951
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,543
Droplets that's why

952
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
Human excrement

953
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
10

954
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
Read this all disease we had

955
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,551
Reports are that coming out of Hong Kong and China now

956
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,623
First of all it's embarrassing the Francis Boyle is still pushing this

957
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
Conspiracy about the lab at UNC Chapel Hill creating a Coronavirus

958
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
We've been over this in great detail but that

959
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,815
Sweetness reading of a study

960
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
From 2015

961
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:21,215
He's presenting himself as an expert he has every reason to know that said he has nothing to do with this current out

962
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,799
He also should know the difference between Airborne transmission and

963
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Fecal-oral transmission of a virus

964
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,943
The possibility that the coronavirus can be transmitted by fecal-oral

965
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,783
Contact me and you should wash your hands after going to the bathroom or handling poo

966
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:40,159
There are some indications that this virus May transmit that way as was also the case with SARS

967
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,975
So it's appropriate to exercise caution on that front

968
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
However

969
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
This does not qualify as Airborne transmission

970
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,119
Just because the virus can be transmitted through

971
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Feces doesn't mean that

972
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,215
Being around feces is going to transmit the virus

973
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,519
You still have to contact the feces

974
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
II

975
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
Feel so much like we're in the 15th

976
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
CenturyLink

977
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Oh well of course

978
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,735
Because of the smell you know that this is unhealthy

979
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,295
If you stand next to poop

980
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
Done

981
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,183
Put him in a plague outfit I'm I'm done with him having a black plague doctor mask and get him the f*** out

982
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:20,351
Boyle's handling this is supremely irresponsible and if the media didn't already ignore him when he pretends to be an expert already there

983
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
To be a good reason for them to start

984
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,727
So they're your humors are out of proportion

985
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
That's why you got the virus you need

986
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
To pray more

987
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
Do boils going down this road

988
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,151
And Alex brings up something that he saw

989
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
Recently trying to indicate like this is

990
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
Proof that it's Airborne but I would argue it

991
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Actually the opposite

992
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:45,695
Did you see where Merkel try to shake hands with her interior Minister he wouldn't think we were saying it doesn't sound like shaking hands in the air

993
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
Tristan Hemsworth

994
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
It's in the air you're exactly correct

995
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,215
If it's merkel's Minister didn't want to shake hands that isn't indication

996
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Embedded

997
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
More like

998
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,759
Angela Merkel was trying to infect

999
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Tim and when he

1000
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
He didn't

1001
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
Shake her hand she was like

1002
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,159
And we breathed on him until 8.

1003
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,999
That's stupid and that's very generous of you

1004
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
Anyway Francis Boyle wants you to know

1005
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
That you cannot trust

1006
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
Any expert

1007
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,239
On the matter of the Coronavirus

1008
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,287
For Alex to be

1009
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,223
Anyting 8110 Nazi scientist

1010
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,063
Freak the f*** out we're all going to die

1011
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,111
Look up your butthole

1012
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
Believe

1013
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
We can trust

1014
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
This

1015
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,839
Teams are in Washington DC this team of feds

1016
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,399
Score up to their eyeballs in this

1017
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
Tupac

1018
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,727
We advised the American people

1019
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
How to protect

1020
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
Themselves and their families

1021
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Prominence

1022
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
I would

1023
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,943
Suggested what needs to be done is

1024
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,991
The American people have

1025
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
How to get organized

1026
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
On a steak

1027
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
A local basis

1028
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,975
Even going down to the cities and communities and Villages and whatever

1029
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
Put together a team of

1030
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
Medical doctor

1031
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
Microbiologist

1032
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679
Public Health

1033
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
Official

1034
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,055
Be sure to do your due diligence on them

1035
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
And make sure

1036
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,663
That they have not accepted one penny

1037
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,199
Maxie B

1038
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,247
Biological warfare work

1039
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
From the United States governor

1040
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,367
Good idea

1041
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Whatever

1042
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
You're trying to do

1043
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,767
Course we can't believe the whoe there we know they're up to their eyeballs here

1044
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,815
That's pretty much everybody

1045
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Okay

1046
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
Local a

1047
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:08,543
It gets muddy when you start throwing in nobody who's ever been involved in it

1048
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,127
Any research that has like a federal government grant

1049
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,711
Even worked with the World Health Organization of the CDC

1050
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
And none of those people

1051
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,343
It's going to make things difficult. What you got to do is you got to get together with your

1052
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
Small community get the

1053
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Family doctor

1054
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,743
Who is of course an expert in coronavirus as we all know

1055
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,047
The microbiologist that most small-town

1056
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
Tabnak

1057
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,631
Naturally along with public health officials

1058
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,983
Better well paid for by Noma

1059
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
This is very very dumb

1060
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,311
You just need

1061
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:46,175
100000 Francis boils all over the country

1062
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,991
So we have this last clip

1063
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Hear from the

1064
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
The fifth and what's going on here

1065
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Is

1066
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
If you'll recall

1067
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
Back at the end of January

1068
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
When Alex was pitching Theory

1069
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
About the virus

1070
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
One of his theories was

1071
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,583
That it was the Deep state or Trump

1072
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,935
Release the bioweapon on China as payback for Fentanyl

1073
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
Right yeah that was a good one this was stupid

1074
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
Wow do stupid

1075
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
But Alex stopped

1076
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Pursuit on that line

1077
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Until now

1078
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,687
Could this be, sold it to China

1079
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Could this be a

1080
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,759
You ask Global as base

1081
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,599
Bioweapon to launch of China for their fentanyl attack

1082
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,671
I'm not positive

1083
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
What do you think

1084
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,815
People are saying they like in the past

1085
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
But I'm not surprised that was me in the past

1086
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:44,287
I floated this. Couple months ago and that I just and then

1087
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:48,127
People are talking on the street I'm not saying that I heard it on the radio a couple

1088
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:48,895
Once again

1089
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
Aha. Delivered

1090
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
Is in the grocery store with no headphones in

1091
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Listening to himself

1092
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Like a dick

1093
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,231
Yep so we jump to the six

1094
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
And this is a Friday

1095
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
Alex has

1096
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
Big news

1097
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Stokin the show

1098
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:15,519
All hell is breaking loose as we told you five weeks ago this

1099
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:21,407
Virus is the big one

1100
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
That the globalist we're going to

1101
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Was the end of the world

1102
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Oh-so Mike Adams

1103
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,183
At school

1104
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,791
Reminder to call blister promoting it is the end of the world that is exactly what like atoms

1105
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:43,679
Did so centralized anime who does everything that you say you're against

1106
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
If you change what your against

1107
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
Then they are also changing with Eric

1108
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,127
It's tough to keep track of

1109
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
So

1110
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,039
Alex is basing this starting to show off with a air raid siren and is the biggest

1111
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,623
Thing in the world all hell breaking loose because he's gotten

1112
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
Some news

1113
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,439
Now the models are

1114
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
Millions and millions dying or the new

1115
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
Computer model out

1116
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
The shallows

1117
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
July

1118
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,543
Again these are just models other lands at models

1119
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
2% weight

1120
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,943
Yesterday you understood with that 15% what

1121
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:32,063
What I can't can't miss you without intentionally

1122
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
Are you know

1123
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
That awareness is in his head

1124
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
Wow

1125
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
This is meme

1126
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:41,535
Yeah mean person

1127
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
He's full of s***

1128
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,631
Also this is not a professionally created computer model

1129
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
This was done by Mike Adams

1130
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,959
The news published on natural news

1131
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,079
No one has reviewed his methodology no one is checked any of his work it's

1132
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
As far as I know this is

1133
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:02,527
Maybe not even the professional computer model it's just Mike Adams worked out any put numbers in a f****** see

1134
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
Animated

1135
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:11,999
The more and more you peel back the layers on this ship the more you see that Alex is just completely relying on Mike to supply

1136
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,303
With information that then he can he can then launder

1137
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
And set you know

1138
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,191
Mike created this estimate official release

1139
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,983
From a credible Source in new computer

1140
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Sure

1141
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
And to be clear Alex does later clarify that this is Mike's

1142
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
Model but he establishes it at the

1143
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,687
Top of the show is just this new computer model with million

1144
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Cool

1145
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,295
You want to know how unethical it is for Alex to use Mike's

1146
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
Model like this

1147
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,927
Mike Adams on article about the modeling he did on his website literally says quote

1148
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:45,279
The bottle is not yet. Viewed and should not be cited as predictions or fat

1149
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Facts

1150
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
Alex reposted this article on Infowars I guess you just forgot to read that part

1151
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,471
Amazing levels of s******* Behavior here

1152
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:59,359
Graph on an XY access with just going up and he's like yeah

1153
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
Druid and crannies like

1154
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,967
I know this isn't fact but you can see how bad it's going

1155
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
It's also the article says

1156
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,831
This model predictive scenario where nothing is done

1157
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
To contain the virus

1158
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:16,255
In reality this model is therefore not predicted for the real world over the long run for the simple reason that such strong and revenge

1159
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,279
Engines are inevitable

1160
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:24,191
It's almost like this bottle was created solely to give Alex a headline to cover its carries audience about while he ignores

1161
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,751
The part about this not being predictive in the real world

1162
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,799
And I just shows how many deaths Mike

1163
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
Mike thinks will happen

1164
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,615
Literally nothing is done

1165
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
Do not going to happen

1166
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
What years ago video of playing

1167
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,319
You gave him simcity-2000 would like an alien Covenant

1168
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,719
This isn't predictive of how the world would actually react to an alien I'm just showing you what would happen how cheap alien

1169
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
You cover it

1170
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,887
So this article Ends by shooting on the CDC FDA and NIH

1171
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
Before signing off with quote

1172
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,959
In essence you're on your own

1173
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,519
Read pandemic. News if you want to live

1174
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799
Like legit

1175
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,895
F*** the wild wow

1176
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
But yeah that sounds

1177
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:11,807
I was able to find an article from February 14th on Staten news about computer modeling of the virus outbreak

1178
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,159
According to this article the most recent figures show the range of 550,000

1179
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,719
24.4 million cases of the virus

1180
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
In simulator

1181
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
But it's important to know these are cases

1182
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
She's not deaf

1183
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:27,167
The article also points out that modeling is often accurate but so often not

1184
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,703
Princeton c2040

1185
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,031
CDC model for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa predicted

1186
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,103
Between 550000 and 1.4 million case

1187
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
But the actual number ended up being way lower

1188
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
A 28600

1189
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
That's whale

1190
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Is Wailord

1191
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
I'm not going to engage too much with

1192
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:49,695
Computer modeling side of things primarily because there's a wide range of numbers you can get on that front and I don't think it's useful to people who are

1193
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Positions

1194
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,767
Where those models are useful for their work

1195
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,815
For you and I and most people listening to

1196
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,863
It's an abstract number without a greater contacts

1197
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,655
I want the model is simulator

1198
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,495
Way more important to me is that here on March 6th

1199
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:07,103
Alex is back to using that 15% number for blansett is if it was a total mortality for

1200
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
The day prior

1201
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
He understood

1202
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,527
But it was severe cases that were already demonia and a very small sample size

1203
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
Alex has no idea what he's talking about

1204
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,879
Using sources however he feels

1205
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,439
Depending on what feeling is trying to evoke from his audience

1206
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:25,791
You know that you chose an understanding of the limitations of the Lancet study on Thursday

1207
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,351
Then he's using it to scare people on Friday

1208
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:33,471
The factory showed that Awareness on Thursday leaves me convinced that on Friday he's consciously lying to his audience

1209
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,007
It's about that what that number really mean

1210
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,567
You consciously and intentionally lying to his audience

1211
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
It's to scare them about the outbreak

1212
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
Which is a normal humans call

1213
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Listeria

1214
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,647
We learned on our last episode that Alex believes that Donald Trump

1215
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,951
Secretly declared a national emergency

1216
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,791
Didn't see a month ago the response

1217
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
To him

1218
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,911
Declaring National Emergency

1219
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,447
I'm not even going to try

1220
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,007
So Alex does still believe that

1221
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
That although Alex

1222
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,615
On the on the 50 did say the Trump was complicit

1223
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
In this cover-up

1224
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
CDC

1225
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,015
President Cyrus emergency declaration today

1226
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
That's what it is. It's emergency

1227
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
Emergency declaration

1228
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,903
We told you about that

1229
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
On Monday

1230
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Eminem

1231
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
National

1232
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Declaration

1233
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,375
Quietly been doing a lot to deal with it

1234
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,191
So that funding bill wasn't a declaration of an emergency

1235
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
No matter how much Alex might want

1236
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
A 10

1237
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
That was a bill that was rushed through Congress

1238
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
The Trump sign

1239
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
It was not a declaration of anything it's

1240
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,127
It's just authorization

1241
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,431
To fund the billions of dollars to be used in developed

1242
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Open treatment

1243
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
Al Public Health measures

1244
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
The only person

1245
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
Who voted against

1246
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
Memphis Belle in the Senate was you guessed it

1247
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,135
Alex's old buddy Rand Paul

1248
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,183
Show themselves to be more and more of a dick

1249
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,463
Everyday

1250
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,023
Villanova's Ron shoes

1251
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
Just f***

1252
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:07,167
You knew everybody else was going to vote it you did it just to get attention you're at

1253
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
Child

1254
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:15,615
Trump is not declared a National Emergency neither public nor Secrets there was a public health emergency was declared back at the end of

1255
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,943
January but that's a very different thing as we discussed in our last episode

1256
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,503
I was just making this s*** up and lying to his audience about

1257
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
Is emergency funding bill

1258
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
In order to

1259
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
Further his

1260
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
Convoluted

1261
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
And contradictory

1262
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Narrative

1263
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
It's about what Trump is doing

1264
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,999
It just doesn't get more authoritarian then

1265
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Then like

1266
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,071
Blaming the media for criticize

1267
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,119
Trump for doing a bad job

1268
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
While at the same time

1269
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
Insisting that he

1270
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
Secretly

1271
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,983
Doing a good job

1272
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,263
Even though all evidence

1273
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
Suggest that he's doing a bad job

1274
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,103
And you yourself claimed that he

1275
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
He's in a cover-up

1276
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
Of him doing such a bad

1277
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Ja

1278
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
And you're like

1279
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:57,855
I don't call I don't understand that guy understand why you ever confused position

1280
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,951
What I would I left out of there was obviously that Obama soda virus

1281
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Send it all his fault

1282
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,047
So Mike Adams shows up cuz he's made this model

1283
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Cool right

1284
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Cool

1285
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
Great

1286
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
So whether they get to talkin about

1287
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
This

1288
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
The cover-up

1289
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
ICDC

1290
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,031
That Trump is in office

1291
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,847
Mike has an interesting Theory

1292
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
What's that real quick

1293
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
This is a big question

1294
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,735
How can you just be in on the cover-up

1295
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
If you're the

1296
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,295
President running the CDC

1297
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,623
Deleting it right

1298
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,671
We are

1299
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,487
I want to talk about that he wants to talk about bikes

1300
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
The new Theory

1301
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,167
Sabotage

1302
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
Left behind

1303
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
Trap has been set up

1304
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,311
To be blamed

1305
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
What kind

1306
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,663
DC has always hated

1307
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:03,391
This is a revenge and love CDC just got to

1308
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:08,511
That's right so now I guess Trump's not even on the cover-up

1309
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:14,399
They're hurt feel like they're punching me in the face over and over and over again and I can't do it

1310
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,959
This is violently

1311
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:22,079
So far up to this point Alex has not acknowledged the whole thing about Trump in the cdc's budge

1312
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:28,479
A lot of people have made accusations that Trump cut CDC budget

1313
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,039
Something that Trump did to cut off their bioweapons

1314
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Production money

1315
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
The CDC was furiously

1316
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
City cut their budgets

1317
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,671
They bungled the response to the Coronavirus

1318
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Payback

1319
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,767
Superman narrative standpoint this is putting a hat on a

1320
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:46,911
Alice already has the hole of the globalist released the bioweapon to crash the economy and embarrass Trump narrative

1321
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:52,031
There's no reason to a subplot about scientist being mad about a decreased budget

1322
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:58,431
Get personal you bring it back down to the personal this is disgruntled know

1323
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,527
If this were part of the script that I was editing I would say cut it out

1324
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,367
Just get rid of it it's not adding anything it's kind of confusing.

1325
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
It's really them

1326
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,463
I don't know it's go. Anymore

1327
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,863
I hope this gets better I want there to be no love story in the CDC we're also Obama had a secret

1328
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,703
That with up agent straw

1329
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,775
Yeah that's what I want

1330
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,591
I got

1331
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:30,431
Problem here is the Trump didn't cut the CDC funding

1332
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
That's a messy people keep repeating but it's not true

1333
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,319
You'll be true to save it until he signed that emergency

1334
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,391
The funding bill there wasn't enough money going to the right places

1335
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:43,231
And until he declares a National Emergency a lot of the funds that could be used

1336
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
For all this stuff

1337
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Unavailable

1338
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,631
Because they can only be used in those

1339
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Kathy got their butt

1340
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,031
It's not that he's cutting their budget it's that his actions are withholding

1341
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
To an extent

1342
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,919
It is proposed budget for the fiscal year 2021 there's apparently an app

1343
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,991
Approximately 16% decrease in the cdc's budget

1344
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,551
But this budget has not yet been approved by Congress

1345
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,575
Send us is not act

1346
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,159
Many folks including some Democratic presidential candidates

1347
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,207
So got details wrong on this and dust

1348
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,511
Lots of people think Trump actually cut funds

1349
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
For the CDC

1350
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,583
Including people like Alex and Mike Adams apparel

1351
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,399
They're a bunch of other things in play here that are

1352
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
Just more

1353
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,703
Kind of stupidity and negligence

1354
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,263
Then outright malicious action on Trump's part

1355
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:31,103
Princeton to 2018 the capabilities of the cdc's global.

1356
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Disease outbreak

1357
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,175
Prevention efforts were reduced by 80%

1358
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,759
A lot of people interpreted that is Trump cutting 80 per-cent of their budget

1359
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:42,367
But in reality was the result of the existing allotted funds for that program running out

1360
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,647
And Trump and Congress

1361
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,695
Not making sure that it was fully funded

1362
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,767
That seems like a negligence thing yeah I could argue that it's

1363
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
Symantec said that he's cutting the bud we're sure

1364
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
But it's not

1365
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
Quite the same

1366
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,959
Also in 2018 rear Admiral Timothy ziemer

1367
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,031
The senior director for Global Health security and bio-defense

1368
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,847
The National Security Council was removed from his position

1369
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,127
His whole team was

1370
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
Expanded

1371
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
According to Snopes

1372
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,455
They are people who are quote

1373
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,271
Responsible for coordinating response to a pandemic

1374
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,063
Add after the firing

1375
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,343
Zebra was not replaced

1376
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
And the team remain disband

1377
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:19,999
Okay it's hard to say exactly who is responsible for this though weather was Trump or the head of the

1378
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
Security account

1379
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Audrey doing a reorganization

1380
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
Zacian But ultimately

1381
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:29,215
States where the buck stops so is responsible for that but how much is that is he didn't

1382
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,287
No that is a possibility

1383
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:38,687
Don't know absolutely that one could be a negligent thing and again right that comes down to is semantic thing did he

1384
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Decrease

1385
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,783
The viability of that team

1386
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,063
Operate

1387
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,343
Or did he just

1388
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,647
Not realize that team was gone

1389
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,463
And failed to ree-ree

1390
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
Appoint

1391
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:57,887
Yeah I mean in this case though I also find it like the argument of whether or not this was do we have a militia

1392
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
Isis leader or no

1393
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,935
Incompetent leader is that

1394
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
Kind of debate

1395
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,751
Text to me

1396
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Nmd effect

1397
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,591
Ultimately

1398
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,919
Right on that level agree with you but

1399
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
To saying his narrative about the

1400
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,783
Angry CDC employees

1401
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,551
I agree with

1402
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,367
Ultimately the matter surrounding these things are far more

1403
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,903
Complicated that sang the Trump cut

1404
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
The CDC pot

1405
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,207
That's a grotesque

1406
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
Oversimplification

1407
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:26,815
But you see the way it's the way that our understand

1408
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,119
You know that he needs to spend

1409
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:33,215
Because he believes the Trump straight-up cut the cdc's budget

1410
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,239
Because if you do

1411
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,543
Make Trump look bad and dumb

1412
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,895
So he decided to pitch The Narrative of spiteful doctors in the CDC allowing an outbreak

1413
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
Spread cuz they want their money

1414
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
This is week

1415
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,551
Yeah I week stuff I really I really think that that makes

1416
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
Them the most

1417
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
Evil people in history

1418
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:57,791
Leica CDC well

1419
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,119
I'm just going to let the world get f***** up by a virus because

1420
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
Cuz I needed

1421
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
2 billion more in funding for the

1422
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
The fiscal year of 20

1423
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,775
20 character motivations don't make sense

1424
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Good in this case

1425
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
So Mike

1426
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
Has

1427
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
Yes Biz model

1428
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,711
And it's Alex has pitched

1429
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:20,831
At the start of the show as a like professional computer models not attach to Mike Adams

1430
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,671
By now it's clear that it's Mike's and Mike is talking about his model

1431
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:29,023
And even he has to tell Alex that you need to change the headline on the story

1432
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
About this

1433
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,935
Think that this is a

1434
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
A prediction

1435
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
That has no qualifiers

1436
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:45,151
This is this is a model of 100

1437
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
You're coming on

1438
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,527
With alert projection model

1439
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
U.s. Buy

1440
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
July 4th

1441
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:59,743
We need to make sure the sub-headline is there the sub-headline up there is

1442
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:05,375
Okay awesome oh no what year so that line was

1443
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:15,359
That's right even f****** Mike Adams realizes that the way Alex was reporting on this was

1444
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,895
Sensational and

1445
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,687
That's me

1446
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
At sign

1447
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,735
Yep that is

1448
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:26,367
Bad I understand what you're saying but I want to make sure my listeners don't understand

1449
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:31,999
You're really giving up the game fine we'll put that sub headline up there or whatever

1450
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,279
Make it smaller

1451
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,351
So that's a point of disagreement between him and Alex

1452
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
How to use his

1453
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:42,495
Models and as well as their globalist ideology sure Mike Mike Michael global

1454
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
Globalist

1455
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,615
So there's another thing

1456
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
And that is this notion

1457
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:53,247
The secret National Emergency that Trump declared

1458
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,551
Mike doesn't believe that

1459
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,855
National Emergency

1460
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
100%

1461
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
It will happen

1462
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:04,255
They will be extreme severe restrictions on domestic air travel

1463
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Road travel

1464
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,327
Toby cities under quarantine

1465
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,375
There will be roadside check

1466
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,655
Points in certain areas

1467
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
There will be

1468
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,727
Empty universities empty School

1469
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
Campuses

1470
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
Corporate

1471
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:20,127
Corporations will send their employees home in massive numbers much larger than anything

1472
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,455
We are about to experience a shutdown

1473
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,527
Have American society beginning around

1474
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
June

1475
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
July

1476
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,903
Going to be the summer of Rage

1477
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,975
Hell in America

1478
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
So close

1479
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,535
So close

1480
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,351
You could almost taste it

1481
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
Sommer Ray

1482
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,471
Sprint.com

1483
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:51,871
Autism slam dunk but some of the things that he saw that mean he's super Sensational in a

1484
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,455
It's over for Humanity

1485
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
But he's

1486
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,759
These things that you say

1487
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,551
Conceivable

1488
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,831
In terms of if things

1489
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:07,231
Things go down negative handled correctly there could be a massive disruption right

1490
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,279
Things that are normal life

1491
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
Yeah

1492
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,375
It's over like that is

1493
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:18,495
Time I'm I'm not I'm not playing that quip to necessarily mock like

1494
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:24,639
Schools will be closed

1495
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:31,039
So Mike has this model that is 2. something Million Dead if nothing is done

1496
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:36,415
But nothing is done is not a conceivable thing to happen in reality so the model is

1497
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Useless

1498
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,231
Except as a way to

1499
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,535
Put a big number here to scare people for Alex

1500
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,863
Mike actually believes that the numbers are way way

1501
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,423
It's way worse than the numbers I've already

1502
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,495
Because

1503
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:56,127
I don't know what's wrong I don't know why it's being intentionally bought

1504
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
Because they're covering it up from

1505
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,735
President to blame him that when it explodes

1506
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,527
No he's covering it up

1507
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,415
Russia failed impeachment failed this is our next attempt to CDC is trying to take out Trump

1508
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
That's what's happening

1509
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,511
Mike Peggy so much wow well hopefully work repair

1510
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,071
Help for the word Festival of oneself or I

1511
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,679
For the worse to try to overthrow America

1512
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,495
I just

1513
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,519
Read this is

1514
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
It's it's Madness

1515
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,919
Did the way that this is James from proposition on the the cover-ups

1516
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,759
Tonneau cover up aimed at Trump by Angry CDC scientists

1517
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
Who want their money

1518
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,087
I don't even I can't even

1519
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
I can't even handle it

1520
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,951
I would like to tell every sci-fi author whose like

1521
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,791
The only thing that will bring Humanity together is a threat to all of us if

1522
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,583
Sedalia comes or if a virus

1523
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
F*** off

1524
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,727
Half of humanity can be like

1525
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,519
Does the president forever

1526
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,799
It's sad

1527
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,383
Saint Philip K Dick's did not predict this

1528
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
So Alex

1529
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:08,063
Get back to talking about this this whole situation he believes that the Chinese of course so the government released this

1530
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,135
On purpose

1531
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
This is f***** up

1532
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,719
Try to do it on purpose

1533
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,279
On accident now

1534
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,095
This lets them clampdown their use control flies

1535
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,143
Dependent

1536
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,423
Our supply chain

1537
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
Because

1538
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,751
We're dependent on that

1539
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,223
Viruses

1540
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,575
So if I understand the narrative is being presented now

1541
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:47,231
The Chinese government release the bioweapon on themselves in order to help further the goals of the CDC who are mad because their funding was cut

1542
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,815
How many goddamn moving pieces does this stupid conspiracy have

1543
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,655
Ocean's 11 of virus outbreak

1544
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
Who let Tom Clancy

1545
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,239
Bi-Rite reality now what

1546
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:06,431
Insperity

1547
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
Is overbooked

1548
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
BBW

1549
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,575
Yeah and some weird sex scene

1550
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
Indigo.com without it looking

1551
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:20,511
Also you'll hear there at the end Alex trying to explain. I think he's trying to explain the outbreak in Iran saying that Islam

1552
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:24,607
Pharmacist infected themselves or possibly that's his explanation for how he just got to other

1553
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,679
He's unclear about what he's talking about at this point

1554
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,215
Again if I were an editor

1555
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
And I was like this is a draft

1556
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:37,151
Screenplay I would say go ahead and cut out the Islamic terrorists subplot you don't need that to explain the spread of a virus

1557
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,967
What appropriate steps aren't taken

1558
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:43,295
Also Alex wasn't told about quote islamists to we're going to

1559
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,855
Infect themselves months ago by Army sources

1560
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,647
Like he claims in that clip

1561
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,951
He was told about it on February 8th

1562
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,975
By Mike Adams

1563
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,767
Any enemy Nations

1564
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
Does Iran or no

1565
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
North Korea

1566
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
Can simply send

1567
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,863
10 human volunteer

1568
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
Here's to the Ohana

1569
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
Don't get infected

1570
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
They can bring it back

1571
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
They can Harvest it from their saliva they can wrap a

1572
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
Located in egg yolk

1573
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,615
If you pay attention all of Alex's information is laundered

1574
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:11,711
He pretends he has these sources in their their mysterious nature and their official

1575
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,015
Status Cube he's playing some kind of credibility

1576
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:18,111
But 10 times out of 9 it's just some dumb bulshit one of his friends said on the show

1577
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,415
But Alex is pretending came from whistleblower

1578
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,951
Really transparent

1579
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
Pathetic

1580
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,511
See-through a little bit

1581
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
Very

1582
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
So I was confused like

1583
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,375
I initially thought that he was

1584
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
Cindy's

1585
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
Islamists

1586
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
Is you trying to

1587
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,239
Explain why there's an outbreak in a rod

1588
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
And then you talk to your Lieutenant

1589
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,871
And by that I mean I listen to little more okay well there's that

1590
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,919
Explains what he means it turns out he's just a

1591
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,943
F****** racist

1592
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,479
This comes in

1593
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,599
Where the stars looking for delivery

1594
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,671
Sneeze on a few people now man

1595
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,487
He was probably putting it into the food

1596
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:04,191
So turns out out to talking about Italy when he decided to blame Muslim

1597
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
Spreading the virus

1598
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,775
He's just straight-up making things up

1599
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:13,151
The first cases of coronavirus in Italy were Chinese couple from Wuhan who arrived in Italy on January

1600
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
23rd

1601
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:20,575
Alex is racist narrative is based on a misrepresentation of a story about a Pakistani man living in Italy who apparently did not

1602
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
La quarantine himself after

1603
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
Testing positive for the virus

1604
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
The circumstance

1605
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,719
Does a good story or not clear so I can't speak

1606
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
Do that

1607
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
Gigantic Lee

1608
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
For someone to make that

1609
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,351
Person's intention was to infect

1610
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655
The story was published first

1611
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,215
Italian Outlet called

1612
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Chorus

1613
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,519
On

1614
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:45,663
It covered this Pakistani man but at no point did it claim that this man was the first person in the country with the Coronavirus

1615
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,991
That story was that used as a source for historians

1616
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,783
Quote pro-west blog

1617
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,551
Free West

1618
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,575
Media

1619
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,855
With the headline quote

1620
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
Italian Italy's patient zero

1621
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,207
Migrant who delivered food at home

1622
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,767
They completely add the patient zero thing to

1623
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,047
The story which was not reflect

1624
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,071
Didn't their initial source

1625
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,911
Because this is a Blog dedicated to demonizing non-white immigrants

1626
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,543
Funtrivia Alex's old buddy Paul Craig Roberts is a contributor to freewestmedia

1627
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,823
Which of the prize no one

1628
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,895
He was also a writer for the white nationalist publication vdare

1629
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
From 2000

1630
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:18,943
2013

1631
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:24,319
Wait a way to keep popping up guy you're doing you're doing good evil got to work

1632
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:30,719
So from that point after this story was embellished it was picked up a game subtraction and white nationalist circles but honestly

1633
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,815
Even the comments on freewestmedia don't seem to buy the story with one of them calling it

1634
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,607
This is as

1635
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,191
So often the case one more piece of evidence that Alex gets his news from

1636
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,727
I'm completely racist sources

1637
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
And then

1638
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,055
Ones that don't engage in any kind of fact check

1639
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,335
And also offense

1640
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
Sometimes y

1641
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,895
Bushel racist agenda

1642
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
Also

1643
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,967
I guess you know too

1644
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,527
In order for Alex's narrative to make any sense

1645
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,391
They have to be Pakistani as long as a sleeper cells employed his food delivery people in Italy

1646
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,951
Thor working with the Chinese government in order to

1647
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Embarrass Trump

1648
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,815
In the cdc's involved because they want their money

1649
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,631
Thread on this one Global conspiracy

1650
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,447
It's the big one

1651
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Working together

1652
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,751
An inexplicable way

1653
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
Yeah

1654
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,359
If this wasn't about like a really serious topic this would be really fun

1655
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
Yeah yeah

1656
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,943
And it's very races

1657
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,503
Alex is doing this stuff's Project Camelot

1658
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
Aliens are real

1659
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:31,135
Like this is exactly how you be like this is irresponsible Behavior

1660
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,463
We actually have Xenomorphs outside of our home

1661
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,607
He has these established

1662
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,631
Pieces of

1663
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
Right

1664
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,959
You've got that it's man-made

1665
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
Short you've got that they sold at the

1666
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,519
The Chinese

1667
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,287
He's mad

1668
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
No one is to

1669
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:55,455
Talking about it we're getting ready to clamp down on party are many parts of world using this phone

1670
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:01,855
Virus is the pre-tax but nobody made by 11 Labs Obama

1671
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,415
We are

1672
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,719
This is where I get kind of personally offended

1673
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:13,375
Is like Alex is up here complaining about on no one's talking about how the virus is man-made and how about them so China

1674
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,679
Places like CNN and MSNBC

1675
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:20,543
They're not talking about that stuff cuz it's all bulshit he created out of thin air using lunatic sources

1676
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
And lying about various artists

1677
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
There's no reason

1678
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
For them to be covering that

1679
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:29,503
But we are that's what we're here

1680
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,319
Recovering the idea of the viruses man-made

1681
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,343
Ground covering

1682
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,135
You claim that Obama sold it to China

1683
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,951
What is using Alex's own sources to show he's full of s***

1684
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:42,047
I started to have like what I listen to this is her to do some like flight to Fancy's

1685
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:47,935
Where is just me and says that he read his own sources on air and then you barked at him

1686
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:52,799
I got caught up in my in my head about that

1687
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,335
Dream dream dream

1688
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,151
Take some calls now on the

1689
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,199
Michelle and he gets a caller

1690
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,247
That really really bummed me out

1691
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,063
Here's my question

1692
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,367
I want you and Mike Adams.

1693
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,159
Rosanna Pansino

1694
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,743
And I really plan my lifestyle around what you got

1695
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:19,167
What a bummer I plan my lifestyle around with you and Mike Adams

1696
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,215
Same

1697
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,263
Caller wants to cuddle

1698
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,335
Please the caller wants to know when is it

1699
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,359
Time to bug out

1700
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,663
When is it time to just hit the woods

1701
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,455
And Alex has

1702
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,783
And then this caller actually has an interesting follow-up question

1703
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,111
That Alex does not answer well okay

1704
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,415
Bugging out I don't want to use the term cell

1705
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,207
Quarantine

1706
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
Self-isolate

1707
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,791
How do we know when it's getting

1708
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,839
Take it on our own to just be

1709
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:54,495
And get away from the world if I was retired and didn't have to be in Austin I would already be preparing the next E-Waste Ali

1710
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:58,591
Fidget exponential

1711
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,407
Then bombing as soon as possible

1712
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,479
Okay well here's what I worry about when I watch your show

1713
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,247
I try to take

1714
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
Mikey from y'all

1715
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,855
But I still see you sending Olin and Savannah and Millie and

1716
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,903
Rally's in Canby

1717
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Inventions

1718
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
And

1719
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,743
They're not wearing masks and it doesn't look like they're very

1720
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,751
We've actually had those discussions now

1721
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:30,591
Are you watching very closely I mean I've already canceled one trip and tell people that

1722
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Okay

1723
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,687
That's a pretty good rebuttal question

1724
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:39,551
That was a very insightful follow-up yeah it's better follow up

1725
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:45,951
The moderators of Seattle now time immediately to bug out about didn't

1726
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,511
Have to leave

1727
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:53,631
Try and protect his his staff without

1728
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:59,519
Weiser are you eating that Grill if it's cuz

1729
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,335
Not yet I love chicken fries

1730
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,615
Weeks baby

1731
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:07,199
I didn't eat Burger King yesterday nobody talked about that

1732
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
Stop

1733
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,831
So in the same way that Alex has been really preoccupied with really trivial matters

1734
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:16,415
Reuters headlines that he read on the last episode

1735
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
Mike Bloomberg

1736
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
Eating habits

1737
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,231
Homeless people

1738
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,279
Asher Asher

1739
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,607
He has another one here on this episode and here's a little Clippers

1740
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
I'm talking about it

1741
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,447
Go back to your call. Just a moment

1742
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,495
On this last hour

1743
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
I shouldn't have

1744
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:34,847
But it just did really captured my attention

1745
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,639
Beginner sickening wave

1746
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:42,015
Williams

1747
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,879
That's his only crime I never suggested American

1748
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,183
51 million from Bloomberg

1749
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Million

1750
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Ad spend

1751
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,423
Now let's just pull back from that for a mama

1752
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
How's this going to go

1753
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:06,847
You could give $1000000 to 500 people about a million dollars

1754
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
2

1755
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
327000000

1756
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,199
Anybody knows that

1757
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
Yep

1758
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,599
Guess what the New York Times now doesn't come out defend themselves

1759
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,463
Paul Joseph Watson article

1760
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,231
Blah blah

1761
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,767
Math blah blah

1762
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Pasquale

1763
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:29,375
Watch Predator humiliating 1 million

1764
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,703
For every American Sales everyone that first credit thing

1765
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:42,431
500 million does not give 327 million people a million dollars that gives 500

1766
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
Doubling down

1767
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:53,695
They said he could easily afford to give everyone in America a million dollars that was their point she says

1768
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,255
I knew that was what I said was

1769
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,303
Knowing that would

1770
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:02,399
Billion dollars

1771
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,215
327 million

1772
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,055
It's 327 trillion-dollar

1773
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:15,455
I don't know what's going on here I don't like hearing Alexei numbers

1774
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:21,087
What's up Alex

1775
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
Two segments

1776
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,927
It's on this and I don't think that's an accurate

1777
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:30,303
I didn't cut clips of it earlier because as I was listening to it I just decided to ignore that nonsense

1778
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:34,911
But when he brought it back up I realize this is important to Alex so I will honor him by Chaka

1779
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,471
Episode Alex

1780
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
Has been trying to score some points

1781
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,055
Exxon

1782
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,615
Fun of a segment Brian Williams did with Mara gay

1783
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
Where they

1784
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
Incorrectly asserted that instead of giving

1785
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,479
Spending on ads

1786
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,527
Bloomberg could have given everyone in the United

1787
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
Midstates $1000000

1788
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:58,463
It was a very embarrassing and pretty much everyone clowned on the segment but Alex is using it as some kind of proof that the media is evil and trying

1789
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
Change math

1790
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
Or something

1791
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,071
Not entirely sure

1792
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:08,703
I did not know Brian Williams was still on TV I really thought that he I thought that thing took him down still around

1793
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:15,616
So what it really is is a high-profile example of someone in the media getting something wrong in a very Elementary

1794
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,920
Freeway and Alex knows that he has to make the most of

1795
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,456
Turn on the globalist

1796
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,016
Might be as imaginary enemies but from a dollar store

1797
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,344
Sandpoint is real rivals or any other thing people might watch

1798
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
This gives the minutes

1799
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,392
A chance to attack

1800
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
So anyway this

1801
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,768
Segment was Williams & gaydos cussing a tweet posted by Washington

1802
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,792
Post writer

1803
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,816
Mekita Rivas

1804
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:38,400
Which got the math wrong which then they should have mirror

1805
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:44,288
In the aftermath of the segment Rivas tweeted that she met Bloomberg could have given everyone a million dollars and not noticing

1806
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,568
All of his money

1807
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Which is also in

1808
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,384
Calling all this is just an embarrassed

1809
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,920
Sing song for everyone involved

1810
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:55,040
And that includes Paul Joseph Watson who swung in like a bold Brave journalist

1811
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,064
To cover the story

1812
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,112
He wrote an article about the gas

1813
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
But Paul made a little error of his own in the Arctic

1814
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
Dmu people

1815
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:09,632
The Bloomberg spent 500 million on the campaign but you wouldn't know that if you read Paul's article

1816
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:13,216
Quotes with math obviously not being Revis is strong point

1817
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:19,616
It was immediately pointed out that Bloomberg's 500000000000 doled out to all 327 million Americans would mean

1818
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
They got just $1 and 50

1819
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,176
3 cents each

1820
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,200
Whoops

1821
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:28,320
Looks like old pjw f***** up the math of his own on that post was making fun of other

1822
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
Packing up their math

1823
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:33,184
500 billion / 327 million

1824
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,000
1529 not one point

1825
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,024
53

1826
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,888
So now I'm going to rant about it for an hour we got two segments about this coming up

1827
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:45,984
Obviously palmen 500 million but this should be a prime example of one

1828
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,568
How trivial the b******* is that these guys spend their time yellow

1829
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:54,176
What about how little editorial work is done by anyone in the Infowars orbit

1830
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,480
Shape up Paul Owens on your heels

1831
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,272
Yeah look right

1832
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,296
Come on man

1833
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
Bad

1834
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
It's bad

1835
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,160
Read when everybody embarrasses themselves on top of

1836
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
It's a it's a

1837
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
Vistaril

1838
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,024
It's a head-on I had surgery The Three Stooges don't need

1839
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,072
Need to be interrupted by The Three Stooges

1840
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,376
While another pair of Three Stooges are coming

1841
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
You like right

1842
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,192
Insane it's insane

1843
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,472
Just shut up everybody

1844
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,264
So I just yeah

1845
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:25,664
I don't know I just think it's funny that they didn't all sanctimonious about this nonsense and then still making

1846
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,248
I mean if you take it at the five billion if you take that's what he

1847
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:33,088
He meant to write ebony got a math are absolutely so

1848
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,112
Anyway

1849
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,648
Alex starts reading some headlines

1850
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
Article

1851
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,840
Baba Bean savagely beat 50 year old girl in New York

1852
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,376
Portugal racial attack

1853
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,912
Okay and the cover.

1854
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,568
Story is talking about is about a big gang of youths attacking a fifteen-year-old in New York and stealing her shoes

1855
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,360
I watched the video and it's horrifying

1856
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,664
But you can't tell the race of the victim

1857
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,688
I'm from the video

1858
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:02,528
From the angle the surveillance footage for faces blocked by a binder that

1859
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,064
She's using to protect yourself

1860
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,648
I read a bunch of articles about the story and know where can I find any information

1861
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,464
In about a racing form everything I can tell there's no reason to jump it

1862
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
The conclusion

1863
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,768
If it was a racial attack

1864
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,376
The perpetrators have been arrested and questioned and as it turns out the victim went to school with

1865
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,960
They jumped her because she'd beating up another girl who they were friends with

1866
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,240
Earlier in the day

1867
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,568
There's literally no reason to see this as a racially-motivated attack

1868
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,360
Unless the only thing you see is at the

1869
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:30,944
The perpetrators the young men were black in your huge racist

1870
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,968
Galaxy

1871
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
That'll do it

1872
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,272
So even the small things

1873
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,808
Reading of this headline

1874
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,856
There they are demonstration

1875
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
What is racism

1876
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
So Alex

1877
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,976
Screams about how he wants

1878
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,000
People that the

1879
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
National Institutes

1880
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Tongue

1881
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,608
Because of how they're dealing with

1882
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,912
Discovering everything up

1883
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,704
Not anymore that was yesterday

1884
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,032
Icons of the globalist

1885
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,200
Some people

1886
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,368
So

1887
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,648
Don't want to talk about it

1888
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,720
That's the elephant

1889
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,048
So what so what he say

1890
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,840
Is that if

1891
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
The government

1892
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,192
Has a man-made problem

1893
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,752
Aha that kills 3 million people

1894
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
Right people

1895
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
Yeah

1896
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:33,408
That's an established

1897
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,992
The globalist

1898
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
Chinese

1899
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,320
Men are doing this

1900
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,904
Extreme language

1901
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,952
He seems very confident about himself which may

1902
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,488
Make this next clip really weird

1903
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,560
Communism horrible I know Satan worshipers real

1904
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,328
I know the left

1905
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:54,144
Love to kill babies and it's a religion for them I said 20 years ago

1906
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,752
Rockstar

1907
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,080
I don't know

1908
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,432
Tell you what you should do okay

1909
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,992
So.

1910
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
Defer

1911
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:14,624
For months now you've been saying things about this virus

1912
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
Cop out like that

1913
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:22,560
Bobby AutoZone

1914
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,888
Able to I would right now

1915
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,960
My God before guys

1916
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,264
Man this is a lot of punches

1917
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,080
And here comes another one Alex Gaston

1918
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,408
And it's guy named Anthony Hall he's not been on the show

1919
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
4

1920
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:38,944
A Dalek

1921
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
Gives him

1922
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
About the worst

1923
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
Possible

1924
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
Intro

1925
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,320
Given

1926
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,344
What I know about the

1927
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,120
He hasn't respond

1928
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,656
To the end

1929
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
Targeting

1930
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,920
Delight deeper analysis

1931
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,736
Story topics that his detractors have targeted him

1932
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,784
That's why I always do

1933
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,088
But I get targeted for

1934
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
What they try to shut down

1935
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,696
He's what I then

1936
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,024
They don't want you to look at

1937
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,400
Again Alex's mentality about the negative attention is virtue or is correct

1938
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,960
Is a bad way to look at things

1939
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,496
Because

1940
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,568
I had to say

1941
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,104
This cannot be worse than reduction

1942
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
Anthony Hall

1943
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,176
I guess this dude hole has been talking

1944
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:45,504
Some s*** about the coronavirus lately so Alex is playing this game

1945
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,624
I thought that whole thing where it's like is that you know what your detractors are targeting rule about that's you know

1946
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
Holding

1947
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:55,232
That he's trying to apply that to the Coronavirus

1948
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:58,048
Targeting Anthony Hall because of that that is not correct

1949
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,376
Payoff for Alex to research his guests

1950
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Just a little

1951
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
Since when Alex brings up

1952
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Calls complaint

1953
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
About academic

1954
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,544
Freedom on campus it has nothing to do with the Coronavirus

1955
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,336
In fact it's about a topic

1956
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,152
It's become all too familiar on Alex's show these days

1957
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:19,296
It's nice to say that Anthony Hall is a professor emeritus because that sounds a lot better than the reality

1958
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:22,368
In August 2018 haul retired from his position

1959
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,648
University of Lethbridge

1960
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,232
This was after he was suspended without pay in October 26th

1961
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
16/4

1962
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,584
I'm just going to read do you hear from an article in the Lethbridge news quote

1963
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:38,240
Comments he made on an online articles and videos suggesting that Israeli and US Jews stage the 9/11 attack

1964
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:41,056
And that the events of the Holocaust should be up for debate

1965
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:47,200
As it turns out Holly Bennett avedio produced by a group called the committee for open debate of the Holocaust

1966
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
Which you might

1967
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,760
Go ahead and gas in Utah

1968
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
Be correct

1969
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:58,464
The Holocaust denial do I assume that when they say open debate that means that they're willing to be proven wrong and when

1970
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,768
They are they will shut down their group right

1971
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,608
An article in the Alberta views quotes

1972
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:06,400
Call as saying in the video

1973
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,960
Quote we're living in a time of huge hate speech

1974
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,776
Speech directed towards Germans collectively

1975
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,312
Jeanette generically

1976
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:16,896
With no real ability to consider Germany's place in the world outside of

1977
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:20,224
Peculiar way that national socialism has been interpreted

1978
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:21,760
Fat

1979
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,784
The Rays

1980
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,648
Using that you're going to get stopped the peculiar way that Nash particular

1981
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,488
In that case

1982
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:37,376
The people he was in the video with from the committee where Alfred and Monica Schaefer very explicit Holocaust

1983
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:38,912
Alfred's

1984
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:43,520
Open featured on a bunch of anti-Semitic shows are arguing things like there were no gas Chambers

1985
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:48,128
Monica was arrested in 2018 in Germany because Holocaust denial is illegal there

1986
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,920
Whole set of those siblings

1987
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,224
Alfred and Monica are quite typical

1988
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,016
Call as I am myself in a

1989
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,552
Trajectory of looking at well

1990
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,344
Is Israel could do 9/11

1991
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,904
What about this other big religious fable

1992
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
Concerning what is called the haluk

1993
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,232
So cool

1994
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,048
Alex's interviewing another Holocaust denier on his show

1995
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,584
They seem to be popping up a bunch

1996
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,144
Lately pretty serious if then

1997
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:10,912
And statement

1998
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:18,080
What was reinstated from a suspension in November 2017 but his real controversial return and apparently he was asked

1999
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
To resign

2000
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,408
So he retired and now here he is on Alex's show

2001
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,456
That's why it's not a good look

2002
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:26,272
To introduce Hall by saying things like they target you for the things

2003
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,808
Want you talking about

2004
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,392
Reduce that Hall that weighs basically to endorse helica

2005
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:35,744
Cross the Nile Valley or not

2006
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,816
The Lonesome place

2007
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:42,400
Just having him on to talk about the Coronavirus

2008
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,424
Because he's been talkin

2009
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:49,824
Some s*** about right so I'm going to assume that he is going to have a

2010
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:55,712
Measured and appropriate response to this that definitely will not scapegoat any non-white peoples at all

2011
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,736
I didn't pick up

2012
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
Too much

2013
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,112
Like a blaming the Jews for it I'd say but I did pick up

2014
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
Some sources that are

2015
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,464
The first is that it seems like

2016
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,280
A bunch of his information may just be coming from Alex Hoopes

2017
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
When I saw it

2018
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Eclipse

2019
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
Puyallup

2020
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,192
Where you were saying while I initially

2021
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,728
Saw this

2022
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,520
Coronavirus thing is a kind of

2023
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,312
Deep state

2024
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,360
Diversion Anna Anna

2025
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,640
Used to bring indifferent

2026
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,200
But when you saw that the

2027
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,992
HIV virus

2028
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,528
Is

2029
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,576
To be in this

2030
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,416
It's been welded

2031
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:41,024
What well did I made medicines cut into it just it just flopped

2032
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:46,912
Flopped onto when they're treating the ill people they're using HIV

2033
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
Remedies

2034
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,216
And

2035
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,008
Ebola remedies

2036
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,544
So this

2037
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,616
Is increasingly the evidence is increasing

2038
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,432
This is a human made

2039
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
BioWare

2040
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
None of that is evidence of anything

2041
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,296
I like your speech pattern Pro

2042
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,696
Says it turns out this guy Anthony Hall is basically just an Alex Jones listener who happens to also be a disgraced former professor

2043
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:14,816
All he's doing is regurgitating completely bogus narratives that Alex has disseminated on his show

2044
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,168
Amplified by the adjacent media sources like zerohedge

2045
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
He's not provide

2046
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:23,776
Any other proof for any of this stuff outside of things like you set it on your show

2047
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,080
I was just so desperate for anyone with

2048
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:30,176
Any credentials do their name to come in and validate is Coronavirus bulshit

2049
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:34,528
He's got to do do lost a tenured professorship over Holocaust denial

2050
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,064
On his show and you know what

2051
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,440
By treating this dude like an expert validating him because his views on the virus like because you're doing that

2052
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,232
You're kind of giving a big thumbs up

2053
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,280
To the other believes there is that

2054
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,608
I'm surprised though I like holy s*** this show is drift

2055
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
Take down this path

2056
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,912
Bend

2057
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,936
Real ugly.

2058
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,336
Yeah yeah I don't think anybody did you know if you were at let's talk about checking the boxes I think we got the Holocaust denial box check

2059
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,896
Worse

2060
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,968
Because we learned of another source of information

2061
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:09,344
That's Anthony Hall has about the coronavirus might as well be

2062
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:13,696
And I've been listening to Trunews Rick Wiles

2063
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:16,768
They do a very good report everyday on Coronavirus

2064
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,608
So here we get another indication of the sort of place is that Anthony hogetsu

2065
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
Snooze for

2066
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,680
Trunews and Rick Wiles are

2067
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,496
Perhaps the worst place anybody could hope to get real information

2068
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,592
H-E-B noted that Rick Wiles is very no today

2069
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:35,456
One thing that jumps out is how he called the Trump impeachment a quote Juku

2070
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:41,856
Play the Jews work their deceivers they plot they lie they do whatever they have to do a cop

2071
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,136
A the political agenda

2072
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
He went on to say quote you have been taken over by a Jewish cabal

2073
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,536
The Church of Jesus Christ you are next

2074
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:52,096
Get it through your head they're coming for you there will be

2075
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
The Purge

2076
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,936
That's the next thing that happens when Jews take over a country

2077
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,216
It killed millions of Christy

2078
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:01,056
Naturally some people took offense to this kind of rhetoric

2079
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,360
Particularly when it was announced that while

2080
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,384
Given prestridge

2081
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,152
Supposed to cover Trump

2082
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:05,920
Trip to Davis

2083
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
People were saying

2084
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,016
Hey we're did they say

2085
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,832
Credentials

2086
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:13,856
Of course

2087
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:19,744
Wild response was to claim this criticism was proof of the globe

2088
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,512
Alright

2089
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,792
Okay okay

2090
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:28,704
Examples Rick Wiles being an outrageously over date December are plentiful over his career so it makes sense that this Holocaust

2091
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,008
Tonight former Professor might gravitate towards

2092
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,080
Lately Rick Wiles has been framing the coronavirus is

2093
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,896
Plague sent by God as punishment for the world sin

2094
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,736
He said on his show that this is a death angel

2095
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,576
And that if you're Christian you have nothing to fear from the virus

2096
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,160
The blood of Jesus Christ will protect you do not fear

2097
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:53,792
Yeah if you were living right for God if the blood of Jesus Christ is our new you have no reason to fear this death ain't

2098
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,352
But those of you who are opposing the Church of God

2099
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,144
Mocking God attacking his servant

2100
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,424
You better wise up

2101
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,984
Because there's a death angel andaluz right now

2102
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,776
And you're going to get an attitude adjustment

2103
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,848
Did that dude just a attitude adjustment

2104
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,200
You know what happens Jordan when someone says attitude

2105
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,352
What happened

2106
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:33,472
Anyway Rick Wiles said on his show at the end of February that the virus will end if China accept

2107
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,240
Jesus

2108
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:39,104
Do you have to understand that this dude Anthony Hall is viewing that guy is a good source of information

2109
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
About the outbreak

2110
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,712
And now he's just regurgitating things that he believes are Alex's show

2111
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:47,296
As an expert it's a dama feedback loop it's going off based

2112
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,832
I if I become

2113
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
I will

2114
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,136
Institute of policy

2115
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,416
That there will always

2116
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,696
Be somebody around

2117
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
Everywhere 2

2118
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,232
Escort you out

2119
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,536
And he needs to be a score

2120
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:01,120
I don't know what I don't know where he needs to go I don't know where he needs

2121
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,912
To be escorted to but somebody needs to be

2122
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,936
Excuse me sir

2123
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,496
He's serving an important function on ALEKS

2124
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,264
To show though

2125
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Because

2126
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,056
It's around that

2127
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:15,456
Time in a show where Alex needs someone else to do some talking

2128
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,992
It stayed where I am I'm trying

2129
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,528
Going to identify different

2130
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
Scenario

2131
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,112
Without

2132
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:22,880
Thank you clothes

2133
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,648
Sibley it's this

2134
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,672
This one or that one

2135
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:35,680
I was eating a sandwich over here

2136
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,776
Before we leave this episode

2137
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,312
Call Harry

2138
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:46,432
No Alex needs to make some

2139
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,200
Baseless

2140
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,504
Insinuations and

2141
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,040
And theories

2142
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,320
There's lots of

2143
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,880
On record of who you know

2144
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,416

Regina thing at the United States and bring down the economy by Trump

2164

But it's up to you to get the word out there and lay it all out today in the most important broadcast ever

2169
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,840

And it's most important broadcast our every single f****** day is the most aboard broadcast ever

It's very not interest

2176
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,176
It's a bad episode

2177
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,480
But Alex does say

2178
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,504
I called this

2179
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,784
I called a bio attack

2180
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,088
He called literally anyting

2181
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,880
B b b that's true

2182
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,184
This is the big

2183
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,208
Enchilada

2184
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:36,768
Not the impeachment

2185
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,400
Probably just Luann thing

2186
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,424
6 weeks ago

2187
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,776
Probably this movie or so love Austin was at

2188
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,616
The Oracle of Austin

2189
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,432
I can't breathe

2190
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:58,784
I cannot believe the lies are so heavy and so aggressively full

2191
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,648
And I know from listening to Alex's show back when he was saying what comes next

2192
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:08,000
He didn't say a bio attack that was one thing out of a million that he okay

2193
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,792
The thing he kept pushing on

2194
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,864
Was he thought that the globalist we're going to Nuke Chicago

2195
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,912
That is what he kept saying

2196
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,704
That was I just feel like

2197
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008
The big ones, they're going to do in Chicago

2198
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:25,152
I called it did say a number of other cities possibly as well but it was largely a theory that there was going to be a nuke

2199
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,200
And I was going to be

2200
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,504
Probably Chicago

2201
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,576
Chicago

2202
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,856
Still open up in Duke

2203
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,416
So there's another thing Central

2204
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,696
I'm not I'm not going to

2205
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Play much

2206
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,488
Watch for Monday

2207
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,304
It's a very uninspired episode you take a lot of phone calls

2208
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
It's very boring

2209
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,888
But there are some things that are important

2210
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
One of them

2211
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,472
Is that Alex is clearly shifting

2212
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
More and more towards

2213
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,544
Any dissent from Trump

2214
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,336
Is evil

2215
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,384
And this is an attack on America

2216
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,200
Anybody that blames Trump

2217
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:02,272
Highland mornings the First Responders

2218
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,064
Anybody that blames

2219
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,368
Frontline medical workers

2220
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,696
When the globalist of Tricom

2221
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,768
To create a collapse of confidence in the dollar

2222
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,816
One of those things

2223
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,352
And this is Modern Warfare

2224
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,144
The First Responders

2225
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,192
The medical people

2226
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:25,568
Cover that is fully in stupid from the fact that he's saying that anybody who's against

2227
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,872
Trump is an enemy of your family

2228
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:32,736
Right now admittedly that anybody who disagrees with dear leader should be assassinated

2229
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,760
Killed immediately

2230
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:36,064
But that's also if they

2231
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,088
Complain about look

2232
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:40,672
I support trumpet if I complain about first-responders I'm right there with him

2233
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,696
I just so happen

2234
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,512
That all of my political enemies don't do the other two

2235
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,792
Sew in

2236
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:50,912
So Alex also the other thing that's really important here on this Monday March

2237
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:54,752
9th episode is that Alex is back on his b*******

2238
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,032
About the silver

2239
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,824
No

2240
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,176
Because things have progressed with the Jim Bakker situation

2241
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:02,944
Can I believe

2242
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,736
That a lawsuit has been filed

2243
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:09,344
Alex might want to watch out because he is

2244
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,160
Percent back on saying it can knock out the Coronavirus

2245
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:24,960
Patented bio silver

2246
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,312
The czar's coronavirus family not that too

2247
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
To do it

2248
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,384
So

2249
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,456
It is like I have to take these things myself cuz I know they're great

2250
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,832
He's he's f****** around again to get himself involved

2251
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
Open that lawsuit

2252
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:45,184
Blah blah live blah blah

2253
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,768
Does mention that his ratings are up

2254
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,536
Hugh

2255
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
I don't make sense

2256
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
I mean

2257
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:52,608
Driving

2258
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:55,936
I don't see any reason why

2259
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,264
Yeah you celebrating that quite a bit yeah

2260
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,312
That's that's immoral

2261
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,616
Very much so I'm going to go

2262
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,640
I don't think God

2263
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,176
No

2264
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,712
Speaking of God

2265
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,992
I would start stalking

2266
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
A little bit

2267
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,832
On this episode starts talking about Jesus

2268
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:15,136
I think I always have a feel for it

2269
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:19,744
Like it's been too long since we've talked about God and ramble about God

2270
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,792
Yeah so Alex notes

2271
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,816
That like when he's out

2272
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,584
Public

2273
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,864
The leftist

2274
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,144
Talk with him anymore

2275
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:32,544
Now yell at him like they used to the shop near me

2276
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,128
First of all leads into him saying something

2277
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:36,896
Not true

2278
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,064
I don't do anymore and tell me a bunch of crap I get right back with your face now the words out

2279
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,632
They don't sit there and run their fat mouth to me in public

2280
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:01,472
Looking eyes look at them inside

2281
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,240
Phone over

2282
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:11,968
Prices on a mission to be crucified and died for our sins and he wasn't going to let anything get in the way of that when he turned it

2283
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,576
Last thing he said was his disciples is

2284
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
I weapons

2285
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,904
What

2286
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,256
Who wrote your Bible

2287
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,560
Stewart Rhodes

2288
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,400
They think about that

2289
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:33,728
Jesus's last words to disciples were not get weapons

2290
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:40,128
I'm coming back way while they were not they were. When Jesus returned after he was crucified

2291
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:43,712
He came back a few before the disciples is like strapped up

2292
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,504
Get your name

2293
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:50,368
Yeah Alex is taking be coming back with fire thing from Isaiah 6650

2294
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,208
Quote see the Lord is coming with fire in his chariots like a whirlwind

2295
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,768
You'll bring down his anger with Fury and his rebuke

2296
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
With flames and Fire

2297
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,096
Isaiah is an Old Testament Prosthetics

2298
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,632
So it's important to remember the

2299
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,656
Historical context

2300
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,704
If it's writing when you're interpreting it but

2301
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
Whatever

2302
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,800
The part about how the disciples need to get weapons is from Luke

2303
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:11,360
B-29 takes place during the Last Supper

2304
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:15,456
That part that people like Alex always quoted the Line quote

2305
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:17,248
If you don't have a sword sell your cloak in

2306
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,016
Can buy one

2307
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:24,672
This is all very good and well to say that Jesus said that but it's taking away the surrounding context of the verse

2308
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:28,256
No surrounded contacts doesn't have any effect on things especially in the Bible

2309
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,536
Here's the Fuller Passage

2310
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,072
Quote he said to them

2311
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,864
But now if you have a purse take it

2312
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
And also a bag

2313
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,192
And if you don't have a sword sell your cloak and buy one

2314
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:36,960
It is written

2315
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:39,264
And he was numbered with the transgressors

2316
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,568
And I will tell you this must be fulfilled in

2317
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:45,408
Yes what is written about me is reaching its full film

2318
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,944
The disciples said

2319
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,480
See Lord here are two swords

2320
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,296
And Jesus replied that's enough

2321
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,648
There are the two parts there that the biblical Scholars note

2322
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
A particular about the

2323
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:59,232
This passage the two things are apart

2324
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,280
He's talking about fulfilling his role

2325
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,560
And the fact that he says that the

2326
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,096
The end the two swords are enough

2327
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,912
Two swords would not be enough to actually fight

2328
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,680
People want

2329
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
Crucified

2330
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:10,240
So that interpretation doesn't

2331
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,104
However if you understand the line that's enough in the context of the Fulfillment

2332
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,128
Jesus's role

2333
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,920
It starts to make a little more sense

2334
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:23,808
When Jesus is talking about his fulfillment he's described it as involving him being quote numbered with the

2335
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
Grassers

2336
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:29,184
Which is to say that he would need to be considered and treated like a common Criminal by the state

2337
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:32,256
As for this theory of the text

2338
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,304
Jesus saying that's enough

2339
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,632
You saying that because his disciples being armed would be enough

2340
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,656
To create the perception

2341
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,680
He was like a gangly

2342
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:43,008
In the telling the disciples to get a sword Jesus was attempting to

2343
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:47,104
To fill the prophecy that he would need to be seen as a criminal to non-believers

2344
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:52,992
Other scholars believe that the swords themselves are a metaphor but with no serious biblical scholar believes it

2345
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:55,296
The Jesus was telling his disciples they needed to get wet

2346
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,576
Cuz it was about to

2347
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,600
Time to kill people

2348
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,368
Listen up

2349
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
The twelve of you

2350
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,928
F****** Mount up

2351
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:03,232
Regulators are about to deal with some

2352
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
Okay

2353
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,792
Also of The Twelve of us

2354
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,560
To sort

2355
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,352
If you're in a fight ask

2356
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:10,656
Paul to toss you the sword

2357
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:13,984
I get it yesterday choreograph

2358
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,520
That interpretation is you

2359
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,288
Unique Boutique

2360
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:19,104
Fascist types that Alex believes are the only true Christian

2361
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:23,200
Leaving aside his completely flawed and violent

2362
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,224
Misrepresentation

2363
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,784
The text this was not the last thing that you said

2364
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,552
The disciples

2365
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:30,112
In fact later on when Jesus was arrested in

2366
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:35,744
In The Garden of Gethsemane he told Peter that hold those who live by the sword die by the sword

2367
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,536
Anyway

2368
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,584
Alex has more biblical interpretation

2369
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
Was

2370
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,912
But you know

2371
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,216
Was Gutenberg really on the right

2372
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
You know

2373
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:50,336
Were the priest doing a fairly good job reading the Bible why did Alex get to do it

2374
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:54,688
I don't know what the priest should be the only one but someone should have stopped out

2375
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,736
That's for sure he's not good at

2376
01:45:57,248 --> 01:46:02,112
That's right I'm anti Guttenberg I'm finally coming up on it

2377
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,160
Has more thoughts

2378
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,440
About killing

2379
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,464
King and the Bible

2380
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:11,072
Right

2381
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:20,032
Maybe we can do better than ultegra New Testament

2382
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,848
Can I come to your house at night to hurt you rise up

2383
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,640
And tell them

2384
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,920
Pull up the clothes

2385
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,480
Bible verses rise up and kill them

2386
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:41,280
Pasta shorts

2387
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:46,144
This verse is Alex that we talked about his Exodus 22 2

2388
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:52,032
Quote if the thief is found breaking in and he is struck so that he dies there shall be no guilt for his blood

2389
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:55,872
That's a little different from if a guy breaks into your house rise up and kill it

2390
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,688
Is it more or less just of ancient stand-your-ground law

2391
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:03,296
Also the next verse literally says quote but if it happens after sunrise

2392
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,088
Is the defender is guilty of bloodshed

2393
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,648
Is loophole is only available at night

2394
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,976
So if you kill someone breaking into your house during the day you're guilty of bloodshed

2395
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:16,096
Be interesting to see Alex try and weave that Nuance into his dumb calls for religiously just

2396
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:16,864
Justified Violence

2397
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,168
We weird it's always funny when

2398
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:19,936
In the past

2399
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:20,960
Heather has

2400
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,752
Rules and you look at who you're like oh

2401
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:23,520
So just

2402
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,568
Nighttime it's so we're living

2403
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,848
A daily prayer

2404
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,128
The moment the sun goes down

2405
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:31,200
Are you put on someone breaks into your house

2406
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:34,528
Like that idea of a in the morning everybody shakes hands

2407
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:41,184
We try it all again tomorrow night it would be really fun really fun proud to try and incorporate that son

2408
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,768
Sunup

2409
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:46,304
The coronavirus is coming

2410
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,840
Obama sold it

2411
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,120
It's time to rise up

2412
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:51,424
We're going to do it around

2413
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:57,312
732 is sunset tonight everybody get ready sunrises it's 6:44 we got to be done

2414
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,080
We got to be done

2415
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:02,176
Dan check the Farmers Almanac will see what it's like tomorrow night everybody

2416
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,456
We're going to have breakfast

2417
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,480
Dobie Gray

2418
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:11,136
So Alex is a big Point here on this Monday show is that like this is war we are at War virus

2419
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,440
It is

2420
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,024
Economic war is also biological War terrorism

2421
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:17,792
Stop

2422
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,584
And he

2423
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,144
Makes a pretty bold claim

2424
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:24,960
This is this is this is America

2425
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,776
This is a greater threat than Hitler clouds

2426
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
In in in in 1940

2427
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,872
And the Japanese

2428
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,528
God sakes

2429
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:40,832
You're going to get you

2430
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:44,160
So at

2431
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,696
Japan today

2432
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:46,976
Kabam pretty hard though

2433
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:51,328
So Alex thinks it is a bigger thing than WWII we're already had

2434
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,864
So that's great

2435
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:59,776
So I would assume that he is certainly seems to hang out with an interview a lot of them

2436
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:03,872
That's weird so last clip here from the 9th is just another in

2437
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:07,456
Instant of Alex selling this coronavirus cure in a way that I think is going to get him

2438
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:13,856
I'm in trouble from over 10 years ago

2439
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:20,256
Torchy's Mueller Co American biotech labs

2440
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:23,840
University

2441
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,400
Security in here

2442
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:32,032
Special Operations Command

2443
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,848
Found with and receive on

2444
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,432
It would take me out

2445
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,736
The SARS virus was the coronavirus man-made

2446
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:44,320
Silver

2447
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,344
What's in our

2448
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,880
Super Silver

2449
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,792
Super Bowl and iodine

2450
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,608
We also have it for children all fluoride-free

2451
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,912
Still

2452
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,192
A lot of the Super Silver

2453
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:08,640
He has information that is about the wounded gel does not apply to the toothpaste

2454
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:12,736
You going to get in trouble he's back on there say a4c

2455
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
Some trouble from

2456
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,064
Yeah all of this trouble mounting

2457
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,368
You bums me out is

2458
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,392
Is when he does that

2459
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
Toothpaste

2460
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,952
This is a proven.

2461
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,280
How lonely must

2462
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,584
Affair in the valley

2463
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:28,864
You would

2464
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,144
Genuinely believe

2465
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,448
That if all we needed

2466
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,984
To fight coronavirus with

2467
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,264
Toothpaste

2468
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,080
Everybody in the world would

2469
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:38,848
Actively

2470
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,872
Hide that in

2471
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
Information

2472
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,408
Except Alex

2473
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,320
Thinking that the entire human race

2474
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,088
Is garbage

2475
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,112
So you might

2476
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:53,184
Confused why they're not on team Coronavirus

2477
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:58,816
So we jump now to whatever one is I'm sure waiting for which is March 10th

2478
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Tuesday

2479
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:06,240
So Alex starts off the show by teasing

2480
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,776
Talking about

2481
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,080
He's very f*****-up night

2482
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:14,944
Keys on a dick he does not get down to business for a while

2483
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,760
Pick my David Knight show

2484
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,600
Transmission

2485
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:22,368
Not possible

2486
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:30,048
No sleep last night I'll tell you about that Tuesday interesting story very informative

2487
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,096
Bird's eye view

2488
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:38,752
Very interesting place such a big transmission today you don't want to miss it

2489
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:45,408
So that's how were teasing this interesting experience last night

2490
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,480
And some stuff to her

2491
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,784
AR got arrested for a DUI

2492
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,112
But if you didn't know that yours is likewise

2493
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:01,024
Something interesting happened

2494
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,072
Start listening

2495
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,864
At what you do

2496
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,448
Extra extra Alex story

2497
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,776
Bees get back from break

2498
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,544
It's talking

2499
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,408
It's enough to almost trick you into thinking that he's had a moment of real

2500
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,968
Inspection and I started to get really

2501
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,504
I started to care

2502
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,112
Very accurate

2503
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,696
Morning

2504
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,024
I'm talking to one of the crew members of the building

2505
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:38,144
He was like you know there's a rumor in the office cocaine

2506
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:43,008
Because there's no way you can be so tired during a break and then explode

2507
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,336
Don't you come back on air

2508
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:48,896
What I do

2509
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,296
And the reason

2510
01:52:59,136 --> 01:52:59,648
Adrenaline

2511
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,976
And and and endorphins and focused anger

2512
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,512
Is a drug

2513
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:12,448
I mistook that for vulnerability

2514
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,728
What I heard that

2515
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,520
Because that is true

2516
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:20,640
Alex does use this performative overblown excitement

2517
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,664
And

2518
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:25,504
Manufactured anger in order to trick people into

2519
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,808
Anxiety passionately believes various things

2520
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,624
That are just made up or just manipulation

2521
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,416
Yep so I heard him

2522
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:34,976
Say that you don't like I'm addicted to this

2523
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:35,744
Sanger

2524
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,816
And I need to get off that drug I thought like yeah

2525
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:40,096
You do

2526
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,888
You do if you want to get help

2527
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,912
Then you should

2528
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:43,680
That would be good

2529
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,704
Place to start yet

2530
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,008
I was lulled into thinking

2531
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:47,776
Maybe he was

2532
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
Sincere

2533
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:49,568
Bye

2534
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,592
Even more things

2535
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:54,688
Is hatred of devil worshipers and pedophiles

2536
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:58,784
But

2537
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,808
At the same time

2538
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:01,600
I got too much of it

2539
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
It's in my family background

2540
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:13,888
Alpha male super successful everything

2541
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:16,960
The others were still out before then

2542
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,848
So he realizes that they are health effects

2543
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,664
Text to come from this unbridled anger

2544
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:28,736
You know high blood pressure or whatever

2545
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,808
And you know you you're listening to lose your

2546
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:36,160
If you listen to this you thinking like

2547
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:39,488
You are too angry you could learn maybe to go get

2548
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,024
Some help with anger management

2549
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,304
That be good

2550
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,328
Be a good first step

2551
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,120
Find the suspect that with really going

2552
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:46,144
Going on is that

2553
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,472
This was more a rationalization

2554
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,240
For his Alka

2555
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,264
Vuze

2556
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,128
Be alive at Burns twice as bright

2557
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,408
Banamine

2558
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:03,808
That is never awake never cares never had passion that's why I talked about the man Irina

2559
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:06,880
Alex

2560
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:09,696
Jones the drug addict

2561
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
And

2562
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,768
Because

2563
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:15,840
That type of passion

2564
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,448
They don't have that drive so they can't imagine somebody

2565
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,568
Broadcast today they need to and loved it and want to come back at night and do more

2566
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,872
Don't have that spark

2567
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:31,712
I know you

2568
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:32,992
And that's far

2569
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,784
You have that Focus

2570
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,576
And that's what we need more of

2571
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:40,416
Turn things around you that's why last year

2572
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,512
W whole bunch of weight

2573
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:48,608
Exercise Better Built some obscure than Christmas came around her drinking again a little bit

2574
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,680
And I'm going to Mount Everest 100% quit forever

2575
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:54,496
Because you can focus away but

2576
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,384
Depressants

2577
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,432
Natural depressant

2578
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,456
Wow

2579
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,248
Orchard kitchen

2580
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,832
I'm at because I care too much

2581
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,392
Take it to take the focus away to take

2582
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,160
Clarity

2583
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:17,792
Did you because I can't handle reality

2584
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,816
Places like that

2585
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:21,632
That's a very typical

2586
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,400
Thank you here for

2587
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,168
Some people

2588
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,704
Who has

2589
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,496
Unhealthy

2590
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,592
I got this

2591
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:31,872
Feeling

2592
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,152
As I was listening

2593
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:35,200
Going to dislike this is a guy rationalize

2594
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,224
Quite a bit

2595
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,528
But he doesn't get into talking about what act

2596
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:42,112
Actually happen to him the night before until deep into the show

2597
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,648
There is just the sort of app

2598
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,416
Abstract

2599
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:47,232
Conversation about the disease

2600
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:49,792
I'm too passionate and I have this

2601
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:56,192
This drug of anger that I use and I use alcohol in order to deal with how alive and patch

2602
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,472
Did I am about to fight again

2603
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,496
A global issue

2604
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,288
And

2605
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:05,664
I think there's a dolt a dual-layer to it but whatever

2606
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:07,712
Alex gets mad though

2607
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,992
Eleni starts ranting

2608
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
About his

2609
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,552
I really

2610
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:15,136
And how people said that he was an actor during his cussed

2611
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:15,904
City Cakes

2612
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:19,744
And again I would remind you that was Alex's lawyer who said that

2613
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:23,072
As a justification for some of the things he says on it

2614
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:26,912
That's why the system constantly says Alex Jones is a fake

2615
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,192
Joseph Kony

2616
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,544
She says that he is a

2617
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:34,336
None of that strip

2618
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:37,664
They they they were trying to get it

2619
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,248
Makeup

2620
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:52,512
When I'm on the show being Alex Jones myself has a father in a man as a Christian

2621
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,792
Human

2622
01:57:55,328 --> 01:58:01,472
Global integrated feeling bad it's not true about Humanity

2623
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:05,312
Disagreeable not let them steal my identity

2624
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:09,152
Quite so important for all of you to be vocal and all of you to be involved

2625
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:13,504
You don't speak that

2626
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,576
Your voice

2627
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:17,856
As well

2628
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,696
Don't let her slow take your voice like she did The Little Mermaid

2629
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:30,144
Her name is Ariel thank you very much and Empower yourself

2630
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,472
If you don't know what's going on

2631
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:35,264
Clearly you can tell if you read

2632
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:41,664
Between the lines to be in the papers and I'll

2633
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,688
Trying to

2634
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:46,272
We like well hey remember back when they tried to say that I was an actor

2635
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:47,296
Look at my lawyer

2636
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,320
Use that as a defense

2637
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:52,416
It's going to be going to be like that again they want to take your identity

2638
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:55,744
If you're just listening to this

2639
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,048
Something

2640
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:04,704
Preemptive lying about bulshit I got we're going to be

2641
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:05,984
Yeah

2642
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:06,752
Alex

2643
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:10,336
Gets onto rambling about various things there's some soup

2644
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:13,664
Like surface-level stuff about the coronavirus that

2645
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,944
It's just all the same

2646
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,992
Kind of

2647
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:23,392
Phone calls are boring along the way a bike Adams shows up and

2648
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,416
Talk about

2649
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
Nothing

2650
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,768
But before he gets to his actual

2651
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:29,536
News

2652
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,816
Of his DUI

2653
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:31,840
He just start

2654
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:33,376
Getting real weird

2655
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,936
Well that sounds right this is Project Camelot

2656
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:37,472
Listen to this

2657
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,520
If you look at the architecture

2658
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:45,408
Festival making the world

2659
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,456
Uninhabitable for humans

2660
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:50,272
Is the globalist plant that he's talking about

2661
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,296
Battaglia

2662
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,904
The Bible says there is a fallen

2663
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:00,512
That is immortal

2664
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:04,864
Does it say

2665
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,400
That lives here

2666
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:08,448
Prison

2667
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:09,984
And hates us

2668
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:11,776
Because we were made

2669
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:13,568
By the dude

2670
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,104
Maroon nahmir

2671
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,664
That's the coolest science fiction book ever man

2672
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,944
2000 years ago

2673
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,480
3000 years ago

2674
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,552
Don't you think the Jews just

2675
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:33,024
Why don't you think that

2676
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,584
Really nasty Nass

2677
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,680
The really want hurt you

2678
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,216
Alright

2679
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:44,544
Humans that collaborate with him through a spiritual interface

2680
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,848
Okay

2681
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,384

Tell me

Tell me who else.

2686
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:04,768
Building a thing to kill everybody

2687
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:21,664
Everybody I talk to you a little Silicon Valley allowed UFOs

2688
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,456
Everyone in Silicon Valley's in UFO

2689
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:25,248
Country brake

2690
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:31,648
I love just the idea of the years of Alex being like I'm not into that UFO alien

2691
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:37,024
To say that I am not on this alien guy I'm not into that stuff now. How

2692
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,048
Now granted

2693
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,096
Underneath all of my beliefs

2694
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:46,496
Secretly I believe aliens are behind all of it obviously

2695
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:48,032
Also true

2696
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:51,360
Look just cuz I believe it doesn't mean I'm that got you know that

2697
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:53,152
This guy

2698
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,256
In the Bible is written they were referencing

2699
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:13,376
Satan Satan was a metaphor for the giant evil alien that lives beneath us in his aboard

2700
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,960
Who built the pyramids Alex tell me

2701
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,008
You should send a

2702
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,032
I want to know

2703
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:24,128
So how it gets off also gallon about to drag queen story time

2704
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:29,248
Tower and I've cut out all that stuff

2705
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,784
But it leads to

2706
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,856
An indication that Alex might be taking some time off

2707
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,624
In the near future

2708
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:39,232
A boy

2709
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:42,816
Jiminy Cricket

2710
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:50,240
I've been there man weekend next week I'm not going out of town

2711
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,032
But everyone's insisted

2712
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,104
Week off and somehow

2713
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:58,432
How do you take a week off during this coronavirus in Saturday

2714
02:02:58,688 --> 02:02:59,712
When you're falling apart

2715
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,248
I mean people are a

2716
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,016
Asking him

2717
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:03,808
Maybe even saying you have to take

2718
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
Some time off

2719
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:08,160
This is just bad I mean I don't want to make fun of it cuz

2720
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,952
Deeply Rock territory

2721
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,000
Know what sucks me up is that

2722
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:12,768
The two of us

2723
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,096
Maybe hate more Alex more than any other people on the

2724
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,424
And how many how long have we been saying that

2725
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,728
Long time

2726
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,008
Talking Tom

2727
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:25,568
Audience was tired of me

2728
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,872
Just an hour and now we get here and there

2729
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,152
F*** that

2730
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,688
I'm so mad

2731
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,224
I'm so mad at this

2732
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,528
I feel personally betrayed

2733
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,808
I hate him

2734
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:36,832
I hate him

2735
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,112
So much and now he's

2736
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:40,672
But I don't think he's going to get help

2737
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:41,440
Of course not

2738
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,464
I think

2739
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:47,328
I think I'll be right back to hating and by the end of empathy

2740
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:49,632
I do think it is like the rot

2741
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:51,424
Situation that I'm describing is like

2742
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:56,032
This isn't isolated this isn't a bubble Alex's Behavior affect other people around him

2743
02:03:56,288 --> 02:04:01,408
Yeah that is a really difficult situation to be in when you're like married to him or his

2744
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,688
The kid and the keys

2745
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:05,504
Behaving in these ways that are really destructive

2746
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,296
It's not

2747
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:10,624
It's not a situation where I want to make fun of Alec

2748
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:13,184
What his behavior is other

2749
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,280
Kind of tell by these things that are coming into it with

2750
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,352
People are saying you got to take some time off

2751
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,376
Those people

2752
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:24,704
Are concerned for his well-being or his behavior is affecting

2753
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,728
That man away

2754
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,264
They need him to stop doing those

2755
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:28,800
It's f***** up

2756
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,384
And I think he's still drunk from the night before

2757
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
Because

2758
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,432
He says that

2759
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:36,480
President

2760
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,272
I'm serious

2761
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:41,856
Donald Trump and get me Tucker Carlson

2762
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:46,208
Tucker

2763
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:53,120
Couple days later, I'm not saying he's copying swrve to their Macho's him anyway

2764
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:55,168
He knows how to distill it

2765
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:56,960
Yeah Tucker for president

2766
02:04:57,984 --> 02:05:00,032
I can't think of a board nightmarish

2767
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:06,176
I've never had a boat I'd present maybe it's time

2768
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:06,944
Bow-Tie guy

2769
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:07,968
About

2770
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:14,880
Before getting to his actual story Alex engages again on March 10th with selling this

2771
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:17,184
Silver stuff in a really bad way

2772
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:20,512
Time Warner

2773
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:25,120
We're just your daily life in your gum in your teasing for regular viruses and bacteria

2774
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,912
The patented nanosolar we have

2775
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:31,008
The Pentagon has come out and documented and Homeland Security and said this stuff

2776
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:33,568
I filled the whole starter on the Family

2777
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,808
Don user the product we have

2778
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,368
Probably having private label

2779
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:50,208
Is about to be in Walmart coming up there they just massive

2780
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:53,536
Not the one they have

2781
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:56,352
I'm just saying we're always Cutting Edge thing to God

2782
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,632
Be careful Alex

2783
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:03,776
He also is talking about the food buckets of course food bucket

2784
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:04,800
Good sales are still being

2785
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:08,384
Pushed and we get an update on that it was a six to eight weeks

2786
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:12,480
Now we're at 68 months I think 6-8 weeks maybe 12 weeks

2787
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,272
I'm not entirely sure but there's other news

2788
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:20,928
He has horrible food in stock but we have to package it and it's six to eight weeks behind shipping out to you other people lie to you

2789
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:39,616
It's next week

2790
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:48,320
So get your orders in only have a few radical 4 weeks before the real s*** goes down

2791
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:53,696
You need to get this from if you order it today but also there's only a week left

2792
02:06:53,952 --> 02:07:00,096
10 time before the price goes up

2793
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:06,496
We also don't want more orders cuz there are too many orders I am overloaded

2794
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:10,336
I am going to try and encourage you to order now because prices are going up next week

2795
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:13,920
Very very contradictory stock

2796
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:14,688
This is

2797
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,456
This is a gray

2798
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:17,760
So Alex

2799
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:19,808
Gets into

2800
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:24,672
This is next week is along the same lines of these ideas of like stealing your identity

2801
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,440
The globalist

2802
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:30,304
Ain't you in a certain way and I might get a DUI

2803
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,584
Immediately after getting

2804
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:38,752
Not clear yet I was on the show but he's wrestling with these thoughts about how they'll paint you in certain ways

2805
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,776
You eat

2806
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:40,800
How do you wanna be

2807
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:41,824
I want to be a sofa

2808
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,872
Gator with the things they associate me with

2809
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:50,016
I don't want my identity

2810
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,296
Too late

2811
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:55,648
Liberty and freedom cannot be Allstate

2812
02:07:57,952 --> 02:08:00,512
For me they think the Liberty Movement

2813
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:05,888
Operation

2814
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:12,544
Is relaunch

2815
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:15,360
So they can destroy their champion

2816
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:19,456
As long as you realize that my destruction is our empower

2817
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:22,016
What am I asking for it

2818
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,976
On this operation is a side of ARP

2819
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:34,560
And our devastating successful truth

2820
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,840
A operation

2821
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:41,728
Again this consistent mentality that bad things and negative feedback

2822
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,008
Is equivalent to

2823
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:44,800
Proof of you doing a good job

2824
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:47,104
Is just never never good it's

2825
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,640
Just a really bad way to look at the

2826
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,432
No it's a recipe for

2827
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,200
Acting out like an ass

2828
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:52,224
Bright

2829
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,784
So Alex now teases

2830
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,064
Poor

2831
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:59,136
Can't believe that he's turning this into a full keg

2832
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:03,744
Who shot j.r. scenario

2833
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,768
Fuk up y'all

2834
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,048
And then

2835
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:09,888
I guess I'll just

2836
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,752
And that and that you should know that

2837
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:15,776
Here first

2838
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:18,336
Before these men doctors another chance

2839
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,152
That

2840
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:23,968
There's no such thing as bad press

2841
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:28,832
I'll take stuff to the artist people there on your Liars

2842
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:42,144
Telangana corporate people just ignore whatever I say on topping knows about me

2843
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:45,472
I just say they're live but you hear it and then you promulgated

2844
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:48,544
Without you I am so dead the water but that's okay

2845
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:54,944
The Alamo went down in flames as well Travis was a drunk too

2846
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:58,272
So it might be appropriate

2847
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:05,440
Whispering seeing is f***** up very weird a decision on his part

2848
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:08,256
That's not what I would want a kid to the family

2849
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:10,816
Costco very weird

2850
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:18,240
Is exactly the sort of thing if you hadn't slept that kind of a

2851
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:21,056
Arc of DBZ I'm just

2852
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:25,408
F****** fight Freeze already I think of the goddamn recap episodes

2853
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,968
Previously

2854
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:28,992
God dammit

2855
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,040
Alex likely saying there

2856
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,320
Obviously like

2857
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:35,904
I need to get ahead of the story use my words

2858
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:38,208
Like I'm listening to you outside

2859
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:40,000
Wasn't

2860
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:43,072
You hear their the end

2861
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:44,864
Without you without the audience

2862
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,632
I'm dead

2863
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:48,448
I think that's a recognition of Alex knows

2864
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:52,032
This is a bigger issue than we even just a DUI

2865
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:52,800
Yeah

2866
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,848
So Alex gets back

2867
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,384
He starts talking about the extra

2868
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,152
True story

2869
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:57,920
And of course

2870
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,968
He dances around a little bit and

2871
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:01,504
Can you talk about I really even

2872
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,296
Of course of course

2873
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,576
I want to

2874
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,648
I'll just get ahead of something

2875
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:10,720
I actually enjoy talking about this

2876
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:13,024
Because it was quite the experience

2877
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:16,352
To see what's going on in this country and and

2878
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:18,400
To go through it myself

2879
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:25,824
I talked about this on there quite a bit.

2880
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,616
Just last year I bring it all

2881
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,176
And I certainly got to the point where

2882
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:35,808
I don't have more than a beer or glass of wine and drive a car because then I know that I will never blow above

2883
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:38,112
0.8

2884
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:44,000
I have no proof that he drove after that c-pack rally but he certainly had more than one beer or glass of wine

2885
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:45,536
I will tell you that

2886
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:50,144
So here is here comes the story

2887
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,192
Alex was out to dinner

2888
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:53,216
With his wife they went

2889
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:54,752
Had to go get some sushi

2890
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:57,568
That's where everything fell asleep probably

2891
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,592
Well

2892
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:01,408
Last night I've been out at

2893
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:03,456
Japanese restaurant my wife

2894
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:07,552
Bottle of sake

2895
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:12,160
Holy shot glasses

2896
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:15,488
60% alcohol

2897
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:20,096
We go home

2898
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:21,632

Where you stand on one foot and look at that he can't do it

2911
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:02,592
And that's my wife that's my belt

2912
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:03,872
Start laughing

2913
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:06,688
Then I know I wasn't being mean that was just like

2914
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,248
But I was wobbling

2915
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:12,576
Alex isn't really telling the truth

2916
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:17,696
According to this article about his arrest in the Austin american-statesman

2917
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:20,000
The only reason the police were there

2918
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,536
Is because Alex's wife

2919
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:24,096
Show me article quote

2920
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:28,960
An arrest affidavit for John says a sheriff's deputy responded at 10:10 p.m. Monday

2921
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:31,008
To a western Travis County residences

2922
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,032
Since for a disturbance

2923
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,056
Reported by Jones

2924
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:33,824
His wife

2925
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:34,848
His wife told the

2926
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:38,688
The dispatcher they were in a verbal fight that had been physical earlier in the day

2927
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:39,968
The affidavit says

2928
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:43,808
He said Jones was leaving the residence in a black Dodge Charger

2929
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:45,344
And that he was possibly drinking

2930
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,112
The affidavit

2931
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:51,488
When Alex says that the cop pulled him over because his car looks like one that match the description

2932
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:53,536
That's because it matched the description of

2933
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:54,560
He's car

2934
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,840
Which the police were looking

2935
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:58,400
Looking for because his wife had called the police

2936
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,704
He was the person the police were looking for

2937
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:03,776
And he was going 45 in a 40 mph Zone

2938
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:06,080
When the deputy pulled him over he quote

2939
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:07,616
How do you strong odor of alcohol

2940
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,896
Which is not surprised

2941
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:14,016
According to the affidavit Alex's story on air is completely alive

2942
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:20,416
On-air Alex says that he was going out to get the thing from the store share later says that it's Blue Bell ice cream

2943
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,720
So that's when he got pulled over

2944
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:23,744
That's what he was doing

2945
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:26,560
But the affidavit tells a totally different story

2946
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:30,656
According to the report Alex and his wife got into an argument at dinner over sushi

2947
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:31,680
Do you think quote

2948
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:33,216
Jones ended up walking

2949
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:34,752
3 miles home from dinner

2950
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:38,336
When he arrived home they continued arguing the affidavit says

2951
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:40,128
Jones stated

2952
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,408
He then proceeded

2953
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,968
To drive to another residency owns downtown

2954
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,504
To get away from his wife

2955
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:46,784
That's what Alex

2956
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,808
Told the cops

2957
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:49,088
The night before

2958
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:51,392
And now he's completely lying about that on

2959
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,440
Alex wasn't going to get out

2960
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:55,488
He just got into a drunken

2961
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,512
Fight with his wife

2962
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,816
Anyway the point is that Alex has a p

2963
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,192
His ex-wife is said that he was abusive and now we have his current wife calling the police

2964
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:04,960
Because of a perk

2965
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,984
Attracted fight

2966
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,008
That had been

2967
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:08,032
At one point

2968
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:10,080
Leading to him getting arrested for a DUI

2969
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:14,176
And then of course Alex turns around and he's trying to play the victim here on his show

2970
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,712
Is a narcissistic monster

2971
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:17,248
Who takes things out on his own

2972
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:19,808
The basic

2973
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,856
Facts of the matter here they he got booked

2974
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:26,464
The county jail in Travis County at 12:37 a.m. on Tuesday morning

2975
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:30,048
And he was he was charged with suspicion

2976
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:31,840
Of driving while intoxicated

2977
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:33,376
Who do the Class B misdemeanor

2978
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:36,192
He ended up getting released at 4:11 a.m.

2979
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,496
So that's those of EU

2980
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,264
The timestamp

2981
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,032
On a lot of this

2982
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:43,872
So after he fails this field sobriety

2983
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:46,432
Task with the officer out on Airways

2984
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:49,504
He's telling the story on Aaron he's already lost

2985
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,600
Based on his own tellurian the everything so

2986
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:55,904
He's a meat so he's got this

2987
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:56,928
The situation

2988
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:57,952
With the cop

2989
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:59,232
Sobriety test

2990
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,512
And then he has to go in

2991
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:01,536
For a

2992
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:05,376
That's it you're going to jail

2993
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:07,680
And I said man I just told you I had

2994
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:10,496
Hours ago album in my body

2995
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:19,712
When

2996
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:21,760
And they have a plumbing keep blowing

2997
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:24,576
So I leave and they put me in a tank

2998
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:31,488
You literally

2999
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:36,608
Don't have any alcohol your blood in Lubbock

3000
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:41,984
It was until I got out this morning that I actually got the paperwork and that's what's really weird

3001
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:46,592
What is shock Alex has some fake Anonymous jailhouse snitches who are

3002
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:53,248
Jailhouse snitches man

3003
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:59,648
You got it you go you get locked up in County 45 seconds and all these jailhouse snitches running around telling you what

3004
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:01,440
What the cops are secretly doing

3005
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,208
Is

3006
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:05,792
The Cornerstone of Alex's sort of like

3007
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:06,560
Evidence

3008
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:11,424
Narrative that they were trying to jam up basically

3009
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,240
He's got to be one of his one of his jailhouse snitches

3010
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:15,520
Was like

3011
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,544
They're stitching you up

3012
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:20,896
They're coming for you they're either called they're saying that you were drunk It's ludicrous

3013
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,688
They're going to send you the paperwork and it's

3014
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:24,480
Yeah

3015
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:28,064
So he he gets back into talking more about these jail last night

3016
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:33,440
That was until I got out this morning that I actually got the paperwork and that's what's really weird

3017
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:34,464
Is that

3018
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:37,536
There were two guys in there getting tested hearing that they say

3019
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:42,656
Only show up and I'm not saying conspiracy here. In the police ride together

3020
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:49,824
So

3021
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:51,360
There you go

3022
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:54,944

I'm certain his making up these people in jail

3042
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,440
Where's alternative at the same time

3043
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:41,280
Well the hot tub does come up

3044
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:48,448
Knowing yeah they're talkin about Alex Jones is here and

3045
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:59,712
Glowing glowing glowing glowing

02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:02,528
Model y

3047
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:05,088
In the hot tub

3048
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:06,880
I did not have

3049
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,696
0 bus

3050
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:14,560
I'm sorry what did you just say I've been at the home at the hot tub blanket

3051
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:16,352
Here is just that part again

3052
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,888
Icymi

3053
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:21,216
In the hot tub

3054
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:22,496
I did not have

3055
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,776
0

3056
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:30,432
Right really quickly

3057
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,200
The Whitney

3058
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:32,480
0 Buzz with

3059
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:37,600
That's what we call a towel I was drinking a lot of alcohol

3060
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:38,624
Cool

3061
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:44,256
So I am I should say I'm interested. I got a DUI when I was 9

3062
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:45,280
And

3063
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:46,560
I will say from Mike's

3064
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:50,144
Experience if you're someone who hasn't had a breathalyzer test done

3065
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,680
It does feel weird

3066
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:56,544
Because you have to blow pretty hard and it's not a comfortable thing

3067
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:00,128
Not like your natural breathing so often times they will have to have Ubi

3068
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:02,944
You have to do it in such a way

3069
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,992
Yeah so I think it would Alex's describe

3070
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:06,784
They made me keep doing it right

3071
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:07,808
Doing anyway

3072
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:10,880
And so they weren't able to carry out the test

3073
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:14,208
Alright whatever I don't hear anything here that in

3074
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:16,000
Indicates any sort of

3075
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:20,352
An appropriate procedure

3076
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,376
Try to get a breath of

3077
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,448
It's. Yeah and I

3078
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:26,752
I don't know anything but Alex as a whole

3079
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:28,288
Is it non-cooperative

3080
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,080
It seems that way

3081
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:31,872
We go back

3082
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:32,640
2

3083
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,920
The scene of a crime

3084
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,456
Alex

3085
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:41,856
Pulled over is innocently trying to get Blue Bell ice cream man

3086
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:44,416
How to get ice cream after getting a degree

3087
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:46,976
Just cuz he didn't put a shirt on after he left the hot tub

3088
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:47,744
He got right in

3089
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,280
He was going to get ice

3090
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:52,608
Glass of whiskey with ice all melted

3091
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:54,656
Because he was in the hot tub drinking

3092
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:56,704
Sure those are honest

3093
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,984
Innocent man

3094
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:59,520
Who is trying to get some ice cream

3095
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:00,288
Catches up

3096
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:06,944
So when you're pulled over often times it'll be various different things that officers will do to try and assess whether or

3097
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:12,576
Spell bee that you walk the line or try and stand on one leg or whatever

3098
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:17,696
I want the main things they do is they flash a light in your eyes because the response that your eyes have

3099
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:18,976
Are very indicative

3100
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:20,000
When you've been to

3101
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:23,328
Answer Alex discusses that big Don

3102
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:24,096
And is next

3103
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:29,216
We have this like my eyes to the crap

3104
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:36,128
Volunteer for 1 minute

3105
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,152
You're like that

3106
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:39,456
Not cooperate

3107
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:40,736
Morning

3108
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:46,112
You got me the lowest level of arrest

3109
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:47,904
In the country

3110
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:52,256
Texas

3111
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:55,328
I got all this

3112
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:56,864
And so now

3113
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:02,496
Yeah I had two beers couple hours ago

3114
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:05,056
Does it matter it's legal

3115
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:09,408
Working on the narrative that they're just trying to jam everyone up

3116
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:11,712
Man Alex

3117
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:13,248
I don't know if you know this

3118
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,296
For the Cubs

3119
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,320
Husband

3120
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:21,952
Using quotes for a long time I've heard him care too much

3121
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:23,232
Who those quotas

3122
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:26,048
It doesn't seem like he's made a big mama

3123
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:28,096
That's not entirely true if you go back like

3124
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:30,400
A decade apologize

3125
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,800
I don't believe these jailhouse sources who told him that the advert right they said he was sober or whatever

3126
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:38,080
And I don't think he's Garza

3127
02:22:38,336 --> 02:22:41,920
Good theater I think this is just Alex trying to

3128
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:43,456
So I would also argue that it

3129
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,992
It's possible that Travis County

3130
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:46,016
It's not so much a

3131
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:47,040
Quota issue

3132
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:49,600
It might be thing where they decided to take drunk driving more

3133
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:50,368
Seriously because

3134
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:51,392
2017

3135
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:56,000
The county saw a 70% increase in BWI related deaths compared to 26

3136
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:58,304
It's possible they put rules

3137
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:00,864
Someplace to get a closer to zero tolerance policy

3138
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,656
We're officers discretion is used

3139
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:05,728
To determine if someone is impaired whether or not they blow a point eight

3140
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:07,008
A .08

3141
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,824
Even if you only have one beer and you blow like a

3142
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:16,224
.01 if you're impaired in such a way that you can't operate a vehicle you can still be arrested for driving while under a nymph

3143
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:19,552
So this officer pulled over Alex had good cause to

3144
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:20,320
Suspect that

3145
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:21,856
There's no way that Alex

3146
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:23,648
I didn't deserve to get arrested

3147
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:24,672
Regardless of what

3148
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:28,000
And he's obviously there's no reason that

3149
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:34,656
Like somebody who's swerving all over the road drunk off of his ass driving around Camp blow-up .07

3150
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:35,424
The cop is like

3151
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:41,824
Well you got it this time but it will get you it don't you have another drink will get you next time we can has to be

3152
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:44,128
About impairment not about that it actually

3153
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,808
The police

3154
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:53,088
For his car

3155
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:57,952
Everything about this well

3156
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:58,976
We started out looking

3157
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:01,536
For the tank but when we realized it was still had to offer

3158
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:03,328
We figured we'd look for your person

3159
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,352
Certainly

3160
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,912
The Travis County

3161
02:24:07,168 --> 02:24:13,312
Is Jim going to go on a crusade

3162
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:16,896
I get to be in court

3163
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:20,224
Sha

3164
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:22,272
Arresting people

3165
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:25,088
Michelle

3166
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:29,440
And they're continuing prosecution to show zero alcohol

3167
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:31,232
On that

3168
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:36,096
He's going to get to the bottom of this man and until his court date passes

3169
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:37,120
This will be

3170
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:40,192
A major point

3171
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:44,800
I still don't think he's going to talk about whether or not people should be used to show up at Rikers

3172
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:48,384
I don't think he's going to care too much about that at all

3173
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:50,944
Be very self sir

3174
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,480
Reform is really about

3175
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:54,528
So Alex gets

3176
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:58,112
Talking about how like he stopped drinking for a while and now he's back

3177
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:59,136
Drinking

3178
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:04,256
We were very clear about from the c-pack episode but he didn't

3179
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:05,280
I mean like

3180
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:08,352
This is kind of gross and I don't want to make fun of it cuz it's

3181
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:09,120
Just a Fool

3182
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,400
Expression of somebody who's

3183
02:25:10,656 --> 02:25:11,424
Like struggle

3184
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,448
Yeah

3185
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:15,264
This will just be a huge nothing but you know what

3186
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:20,128
I started back on New Year's drinking some more

3187
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:22,688
I have that power over them that I'm

3188
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,712
Hundred percent

3189
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:24,480
Quit

3190
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:27,296
So that they can never again

3191
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:29,088
Restaurant

3192
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:32,160
Cab

3193
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:32,928
1

3194
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,720
Bottle Shock he was this tall

3195
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:44,960
What is Express in alcohol when I started drinking again and now I'm going to really quit

3196
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:47,008
Just the sort of thing that is

3197
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,592
Is very standard people with problem

3198
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:51,616
Alcohol tolerance

3199
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:53,408
Yeah and

3200
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,712
Stand-up that's something that I've heard all this

3201
02:25:55,968 --> 02:25:57,760
I hate my life that you back I've heard all the

3202
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:59,808
Everywhere that I go where peep

3203
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:03,392
Seriously struggling with alcohol those are the

3204
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:05,440
Same words that are said

3205
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:06,976
Yep

3206
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:08,000
And it's like

3207
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:13,120
Man I am I hate him

3208
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:14,144
Help

3209
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:15,424
You need help somebody

3210
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,216
So in order to prove his

3211
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,240
Yes

3212
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:20,032
Wait what were we doing

3213
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:23,872
I was going to prove his innocence

3214
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:28,736
To go about it is to show his alcohol test result

3215
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,016
On air

3216
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:34,368
Missouri

3217
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,648
Play right here

3218
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:37,440
Big Missouri out of this

3219
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:40,000
Curious mind

3220
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,280
Alcohol test right here

3221
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:43,072
Two of them they put on there

3222
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,168
0.076

3223
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:48,704
What do I feel shades of Elizabeth

3224
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:50,240
0 point

3225
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,104
That's like one beer basically

3226
02:26:55,616 --> 02:27:01,760
There's no way that Alex's story about drinking a little sake at dinner then hours later getting pulled over can be true if you almost

3227
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:02,528
Blew up

3228
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:03,296
808

3229
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:05,344
It's really hard to nail down the exact

3230
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:09,696
Numbers because there's no things can vary from person to person and depending on their weight

3231
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:10,976
But generally speaking

3232
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:15,328
For a person over 220 lb to have a BAC of 08

3233
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:18,144
It's absolutely categorically not one beer

3234
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:24,032
Is Alex's story is to be true that it was ours after dinner then he definitely kept drinking after dinner

3235
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:28,384
Maybe in that hot tub because otherwise he would not have blown 2.0 76

3236
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:29,664
It's just not possible

3237
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:30,688
Is Bollywood

3238
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:32,480
Metabolize that alcohol by that point

3239
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:34,528
There's no way he's being honest about this and it

3240
02:27:34,784 --> 02:27:36,320
It's just a desperate attempt to save face

3241
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:37,344
There doesn't have to be open

3242
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:38,624
Unreal about the consequences

3243
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,392
His actions

3244
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:41,184
And it's even worse

3245
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,464
The map to cuz like

3246
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:44,512
But there's the time

3247
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:45,536
Different

3248
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:51,936
Downstairs

3249
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:53,728
Twi

3250
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:54,752
And was

3251
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:56,288
Below the legal limit

3252
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:00,896
But when they put Avenues it will be the exact opposite Giant

3253
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,688
Fiasco

3254
02:28:03,456 --> 02:28:09,600
Children and running around with sickle chopping people's heads off and

3255
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:11,392
Canisters of gasoline in

3256
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:12,160
Snorting

3257
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:15,488
14 lines of Nina 14-foot lines of cocaine

3258
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:18,048
Shoving bottle rockets up my rear end

3259
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:23,424
I mean by the time they're done it's just

3260
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:28,032
So he's just making a mockery with the straw man version

3261
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:30,592
The things that people will say about it as opposed to

3262
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:36,992
I I got arrested for DWI after getting into a fight with his wife that is I have been in that situation

3263
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:38,016
Before talking with

3264
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:38,784
Somebody saying

3265
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:39,552
Almost

3266
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:40,832
Word for word that

3267
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:41,856
That same kind of

3268
02:28:42,112 --> 02:28:44,160
Not necessary immunosuppressed

3269
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:45,440
Give me down but it's like

3270
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:46,208
Do they

3271
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:52,608
They call me such a bad person cuz all I had was a few drinks there going to say that I'm killing babe right now that's what they're going to do

3272
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:53,376
And it's like

3273
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:55,680
I want to grab her by the shoulders and

3274
02:28:58,752 --> 02:28:59,520
The deflection

3275
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:02,848
So Alex drops one little bit of information

3276
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:07,712
I hear they later found this in the article that is affidavit but

3277
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,992
It was

3278
02:29:09,248 --> 02:29:10,016
It makes this way worse

3279
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:11,808
It was 10:00 at night

3280
02:29:12,064 --> 02:29:13,088
I've been in a hot tub

3281
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:18,720
Salata bar doesn't make anything better or worse

3282
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:20,000
Npm

3283
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:22,816
Because he said he just had sake at dinner

3284
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:25,632
And in the affidavit at estimate

3285
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:27,168
The time he was at dinner with eight

3286
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:30,496
The two results of the BAC test for done 5 minutes

3287
02:29:31,776 --> 02:29:32,544
When you finally got props

3288
02:29:33,312 --> 02:29:37,664
One was it 11:55 p.m. almost two hours after he was pulled over

3289
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:41,504
That was the one that had a .07 6

3290
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:42,784
Where is the other way

3291
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:44,320
Was done at 11

3292
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:45,344
D9

3293
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,112
But p.m.

3294
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:47,392
5 minutes later

3295
02:29:47,648 --> 02:29:49,696
And that one was .07 9

3296
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:51,232
Which tends to imply that

3297
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:55,072
Kia and drink a bit of the booze pretty recently before he got pulled over

3298
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:56,096
Sense8

3299
02:29:56,352 --> 02:30:00,192
Could be the fact based on those two reading that his BAC was on its way up

3300
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:01,472
It was climate

3301
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:03,264
As opposed to him sobering-up

3302
02:30:03,776 --> 02:30:05,056
In between those two tests

3303
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:06,592
So

3304
02:30:09,152 --> 02:30:09,664
He was drunk

3305
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:11,968
That's the bottom line

3306
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:16,320
Anyway Alex takes this he has this mentality that's like

3307
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:17,600
I am pretending

3308
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:19,392
That I just had one beer

3309
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:21,184
And that means

3310
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,464
Didn't know one

3311
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,232
Can have

3312
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:25,024
A beer and then drive

3313
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:27,840
Therefore all bars must be

3314
02:30:28,096 --> 02:30:28,608
Be closed

3315
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:32,448
Restaurants should not be allowed to sell alcohol

3316
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:37,312
You should be able to serve somebody up here

3317
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:40,640
If they drink that 16 oz beer and walk out there going to go to jail

3318
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:50,368
For all restaurant Berkeley shutdown

3319
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:54,208
And not go to jail I like to remind everyone that Alex pretends to be a libertarian

3320
02:30:56,256 --> 02:31:00,608
What are Ikea seems to pretend that you go into a bar and have some drinks menu

3321
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:03,936
The drive people are

3322
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:06,752
About is how it's literally everybody else

3323
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:08,032
Who's fault but mine

3324
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:10,336
In fact I am so not at fault

3325
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:14,432
I challenge you to close down all restaurants across this great nation

3326
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:15,968
If you don't want me to drive drunk

3327
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:17,504
You shouldn't own a restaurant

3328
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,272
And that

3329
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:21,600
It's very weird to

3330
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:25,440
I know that he's not being literally he's trying to

3331
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:29,792
Make some sort of a point with this thought experiment of chlorella bars

3332
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:32,096
But the point is dumb

3333
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:33,888
You made a decision now again

3334
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:35,424
Yes

3335
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:37,216
Something that you are very

3336
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:39,264
Strong about is how people

3337
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,032
Should make this

3338
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:41,568
Decisions and take

3339
02:31:41,824 --> 02:31:44,896
Possibility

3340
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:47,456
Now one thing that I need to make very

3341
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:49,504
Clear is that I think is pretty Siri

3342
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:51,040
And I think that Alex

3343
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:51,808
Is

3344
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:52,832
In a really bad

3345
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,112
And

3346
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:54,880
I think

3347
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:58,720
Duii is obviously a piece of that

3348
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:00,000
Details of it being like

3349
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:03,072
He got into a fight with his wife at a sushi place walk

3350
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:04,096
3 miles home

3351
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:07,424
Kept fighting with her obviously drinking more than

3352
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:09,728
Trying to drive to another property

3353
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:12,032
To get away from her she calls the police

3354
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:14,592
And then gets you know we get the rest

3355
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:19,456
Like the circumstances surrounding that are really really f***** up

3356
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:23,808
Yeah but I also a lot of it does fall under the heading of his personal life

3357
02:32:25,344 --> 02:32:25,856
Stant

3358
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:27,136
I'm not

3359
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:27,904
That's

3360
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:28,928
Not in my purview

3361
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:30,464
Yeah

3362
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:32,256
But the thing that I need to

3363
02:32:32,512 --> 02:32:34,048
Make a point of is

3364
02:32:34,816 --> 02:32:36,608
Everybody posting tons

3365
02:32:36,864 --> 02:32:37,632
Tons of

3366
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:38,400
Tweets

3367
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:40,192
All this about his

3368
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:40,960
DUI

3369
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:44,800
He knows that that's exactly what he wants you to do

3370
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:51,456
Attention

3371
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:57,856
Lions Gump Travis County great folks in Florida it's okay I told you I only had

3372
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:00,416
Alex knows there's not

3373
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:02,208
A ton of consequences for his actions

3374
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:04,512
Class B misdemeanor he's not going to prison

3375
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:05,280
In for it

3376
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:10,912
He'll be a fine of some sort of whatever he can pay that off from the food bucket money that he's made

3377
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:17,312
So that's not a huge deal you knows his audience is perfectly manipulatable so he'll just lie to them about the circumcised

3378
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:21,408
I just going to get some Blue Bell ice cream

3379
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:24,736
All that's fine he's not going to suffer that much of a consequence

3380
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:25,504
But

3381
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:29,088
He's also told his audience that everyone talks about him is lying

3382
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,112
So all of this

3383
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:33,696
Everybody posting about his DUI is Free Press

3384
02:33:33,952 --> 02:33:34,464
For him

3385
02:33:34,976 --> 02:33:38,048
And he experiences that way and I think that that

3386
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:39,072
Is going to be

3387
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:42,144
The largest hurdle to him getting the help that he needed

3388
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:48,544
Not that everyone posting about it is impeding his ability to get out makes. Sing that

3389
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:50,080
As a positive right

3390
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:52,384
If you get any negative reaction

3391
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:54,944
From people that is how you know you're doing a good job

3392
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,784
I mean if you recognize that he could get this much Free Press

3393
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,344
It's out of a DUI yeah he probably have been

3394
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:04,160
Oh yeah

3395
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:06,464
Very well have been

3396
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,000
Volkswagen

3397
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:10,304
This may have been pre-planned

3398
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,584
There's a whole thing

3399
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,144
I think bush is behind all of this

3400
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:15,424
Liquid

3401
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,728
Cheney that's who's done it it's possible

3402
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,264
So Alex

3403
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:20,800
Comes back from the break

3404
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:22,336
And he has some ground rules

3405
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:25,408
He's going to be taking calls for the show but he has

3406
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:31,808
Where what was the coveralls be alive today

3407
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:38,208
Sold out last night again the clear fact that is a bioweapon

3408
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:43,328
Alright college no talking about how I spent the night in jail

3409
02:34:44,608 --> 02:34:50,496
No talk about the one thing that all of you want to talk about right now ain't nobody bring up the details from that also

3410
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:54,336
An American statesman article that

3411
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:59,968
So we heard throughout the course of these days that we've been covering Alex

3412
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:00,992
Sort of threatening

3413
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:04,832
Murder if any of his family members right Coronavirus

3414
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:08,160
The government of China on notice

3415
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:10,720
He's coming for us

3416
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:12,512
Rambo Style

3417
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:20,704
I'm going to hold a serious possible

3418
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:26,080
Just tell China

3419
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:28,384
I just left

3420
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,944
Showing up in China like where's the government

3421
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:34,016
But I beat him up

3422
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:37,088
Especially if the warning is just like a

3423
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:41,184
Hey you tell two people and you tell two people in eventually it'll get back to the

3424
02:35:42,464 --> 02:35:45,536
So Alex is in this mode and if there's a bit of threat

3425
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,816
Violent talk

3426
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:49,120
Surround

3427
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:50,656
Coronavirus like someone's gotta pay

3428
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:51,680
Kind of thing

3429
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:57,056
And we don't have the police and we don't have the military in the Civil War

3430
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:59,360
We go around them if we ever get to that point

3431
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:00,640
The king band

3432
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:02,688
Card

3433
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:04,480
We're running a show whenever they are

3434
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:07,296
He'll be their own security people in New Zealand

3435
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:08,576
Hawaii

3436
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:11,392
And in Montana and in Canada

3437
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:16,000
There's no conspiracy

3438
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:18,048
They all

3439
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:20,864
Global try to take America down

3440
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,400
The first thing

3441
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:26,496
These waffles are going to get is garroted they're all going to get a wire

3442
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:28,800
They're going to get killed about 15 seconds

3443
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:33,152
You're all dead

3444
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:33,920
Okay

3445
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,968
Go ahead and fill your hand

3446
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:39,296
Go ahead and play your game your dead

3447
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:41,344
Let's go

3448
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:44,416
You know how it is and they're losing

3449
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:51,584
It's not people but everybody knows what's happened so they're viruses successful

3450
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:54,400
Globalist not by my hand

3451
02:36:56,192 --> 02:36:57,728
People know who you are

3452
02:36:57,984 --> 02:36:59,008
They're sick of you

3453
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:01,568
Going to break

3454
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:02,848
Your neck

3455
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:07,968
So this is not the first time we've heard that fantasy being played out die Alex

3456
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:09,504
No it seems like you just

3457
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,112
Supplies that to whatever situation he's talking about like these your security people are going to go rock you

3458
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:15,904
It's like he hasn't

3459
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:17,696
You just looking for an excuse

3460
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:19,488
To trigger

3461
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,048
That fantasy

3462
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:23,328
That's one of the things like

3463
02:37:23,584 --> 02:37:25,376
Thinking about this the reason that right

3464
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:26,656
Now I want him off

3465
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:28,448
Fair is not mainly

3466
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:29,216
So he gets help

3467
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:35,104
It's mainly because when Alex is in a bad shity mood and his life is in shambles

3468
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,384
He tells people to start

3469
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:37,408
F****** Civil War

3470
02:37:37,664 --> 02:37:41,760
That's the that's the inability of narcissism

3471
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:48,416
Experience has his own personal troubles as being like

3472
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:50,976
Devastating worldwide thing

3473
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:54,816
Yep but even when things are going alright he still a little bit

3474
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:56,096
That's fair

3475
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:58,400
Easy the violent guy really violent

3476
02:37:58,656 --> 02:37:59,168
Yeah

3477
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:00,704
So he

3478
02:38:02,496 --> 02:38:03,264
Kman

3479
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:04,800
I'm not on drugs

3480
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:05,824
I'm high on the holy

3481
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:31,424
Holy Spirit you know you spent the night in jail

3482
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:34,496
You you are hallucinating

3483
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:37,568
You are not high on the Holy Spirit

3484
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:38,848
Talking directly to a

3485
02:38:39,104 --> 02:38:40,896
Talking bunny that looks like a leaf

3486
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:43,968
If you don't sleep

3487
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:44,736
And you listen

3488
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:46,272

3489
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:47,808
You up

And listen to what happened this is

3491
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,440
Nonsense

3492
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:55,232
This is what that is

3493
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:59,072
This week vessel cannot even begin to show you

3494
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:00,352
God's power

3495
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:02,144
But nevertheless

3496
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:04,192
Do they sell crack in the video

3497
02:39:04,448 --> 02:39:05,472
Infowars

3498
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:06,496

3499
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:07,776
And see the spirit

3500
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:13,664
Music for a minute cuz there's a lot of music out there but the way that

3501
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:16,480
Synthesizer comes out of that Rush song

3502
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:19,040
In the beginning of Tom Sawyer

3503
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:39,008
Restaurant place

3504
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,032
Yes

3505
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:44,896
Yeah yeah yeah

3506
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:51,296
I'm about you

3507
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:57,696
I'll make sure I plan on that Hill that I got all the strings I've got I think every step just right

3508
02:40:04,352 --> 02:40:09,472
Go out and you know we beat them

3509
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:12,800
That's not not a guy who didn't spend the night in jail

3510
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:26,880
Pets in heaven all the time

3511
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:29,184
Fantasy from Ewan McGregor in

3512
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:29,952
Trainspotting

3513
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:31,232
What is a habitat

3514
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:33,024
Ridiculous

3515
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:35,072
So Alex starts yelling

3516
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:35,840
About

3517
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:36,608
How

3518
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:37,888
His products are good

3519
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:38,912
Because

3520
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:39,680
He sells them

3521
02:40:39,936 --> 02:40:42,240
And you know does he have a hangover cure

3522
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:44,544
Probably

3523
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,848
Probably brain Forest

3524
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:52,736
He wouldn't be able to sell you something that wasn't good you understand I do for his products are good

3525
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:56,832
Battle

3526
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:58,624
Because you can't lose

3527
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:01,440
Because you know Infowars delivers in the fight

3528
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:03,232
It was just

3529
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:05,280
Cardboard box you are getting

3530
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:07,840
You're funny gimpel words win but

3531
02:41:08,096 --> 02:41:09,632
Add a stop

3532
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:16,800
You think I'm going to produce at your mouth

3533
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:18,080
We can dig it

3534
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:22,944
Put my name on something and screw you metaphysically knowing I'd be in the

3535
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:25,504
Cloud devil operation about that

3536
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:36,000
Running around

3537
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:43,424
The polar opposite of the liars

3538
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:54,432
Below the legal limit

3539
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:55,712
Nothing wrong

3540
02:41:55,968 --> 02:41:58,016
I've been Vindicated

3541
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:05,952
Now you trying to hit him with a car

3542
02:42:06,464 --> 02:42:08,256
That's the issue. Me

3543
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:10,560
Never made some of that rage

3544
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:16,960
Seems to be off of

3545
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:22,592
You go to a library and read a book by somebody that's exactly as dangerous as when I am

3546
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:24,128
Drunkenly driving in the

3547
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:25,920
Middle of the night in Austin

3548
02:42:27,712 --> 02:42:31,040
Is everybody else's fault everybody else's but

3549
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:33,856
I mean it's

3550
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:38,720
It's standard stuff for him for the most part but the context of it makes

3551
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:43,328
Saturn

3552
02:42:43,584 --> 02:42:44,096
And I

3553
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:46,912
Anyway we're One Last Cry. It's Alex

3554
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:48,192
Kind of crying

3555
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:51,264
Talk about courage

3556
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,544
We were going to get some tears

3557
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:58,944
My dude hasn't slept he's going to get to the point of Tears

3558
02:42:59,200 --> 02:42:59,968
Jumpoline

3559
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:03,040
Let me tell you something right now we're going to win because of you

3560
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:11,744
The school and working hard in God's all you need to do that's all the wealth of the world

3561
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,024
Injustice

3562
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:15,584
Just letting God you do that

3563
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:17,376
Everything else is handle

3564
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:22,752
You love God you want to be a good person you you just love goddess experience at relationships I love God

3565
02:43:23,008 --> 02:43:23,776
Alan Jackson

3566
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:27,616
That's all the well that's all the powers of Gods

3567
02:43:28,128 --> 02:43:29,152
Do you have courage

3568
02:43:29,664 --> 02:43:30,432
But that's God

3569
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:33,248
Courage is it

3570
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:36,064
Something

3571
02:43:36,576 --> 02:43:37,344
We come up with

3572
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:39,392
As well

3573
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,928
And it's like I

3574
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:42,464
Kairos power

3575
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:46,048
Nursing big dams gates open when there's a big flood

3576
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:53,472
God looking for people that can handle that level of power

3577
02:43:57,568 --> 02:43:59,360
Expand human consciousness

3578
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:00,896
And a minute

3579
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:04,992
You enter into that gate you are now the presence of God

3580
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:07,040
You feel that presents

3581
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:12,160
You don't fear the new world order for all the Slime bags or all the cowards anymore

3582
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:15,232
You just want to be in alignment with God

3583
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:18,304
Or you want to drink in your hot tub then died

3584
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:19,840
Yep

3585
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:22,400
It's good to know that

3586
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:24,192
Well I'll tell you this

3587
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:25,472
On the road to

3588
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:26,496
Yeah

3589
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:29,568
It's really difficult for me is it like

3590
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:31,104
I get my empathy

3591
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:34,176
Triggered at the beginning of that the 10th episode

3592
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:35,200
He's talking about

3593
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:37,504
How he's addicted to this anger

3594
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:39,552
And it's a problem for him and he wants

3595
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:42,368
Do better than you start to realize Maybe

3596
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:46,208
That's only in service of trying to justify the drinking in order to

3597
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:46,976
Udel

3598
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:50,560
The the anchor righteous anger that he has a mcclarity

3599
02:44:50,816 --> 02:44:56,704
And then by the end when he's telling the story of the DUI and everything surrounding it

3600
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:59,008
All of it is obfuscation

3601
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:00,032
Deflection

3602
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:01,568
Defensiveness

3603
02:45:01,824 --> 02:45:05,408
And the behaviors that you tend to see from people who have a problem

3604
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,432
Who don't want to record

3605
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:07,712
Acknowledge that they have a problem

3606
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:10,528
Alex screaming I'm not the problem

3607
02:45:10,784 --> 02:45:11,808
Is kind of a Dead Ringer

3608
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:12,576
For that

3609
02:45:12,832 --> 02:45:14,368
The only positive is that you

3610
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:15,648
We bring up the hot tub

3611
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:20,768
Every single one of these stories involve

3612
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:25,120
I believe that I said you were going to show that Alex needs to stay the f*** away from hot tub

3613
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:31,776
I've never heard her a lot of problems never heard them factor into a story of his that is a good story

3614
02:45:35,104 --> 02:45:36,896
This is this episode was basic

3615
02:45:37,152 --> 02:45:38,432
It was like watching

3616
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:40,736
An episode of intervention

3617
02:45:41,248 --> 02:45:41,760
Button

3618
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,808
It was reversed where it's just a bunch of

3619
02:45:44,064 --> 02:45:47,136
Addicts listing of Grievances and yelling them at the person trying

3620
02:45:47,648 --> 02:45:48,160
I'm helping the center

3621
02:45:48,416 --> 02:45:49,184
Yeah like

3622
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:52,768
It's like an interview episode of intervention that doesn't have in an

3623
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:55,584
Yeah

3624
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:59,168
You may have the resources to not have any real consequence

3625
02:45:59,424 --> 02:45:59,936
I mean

3626
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:01,728
Like honestly

3627
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:04,287
I don't know why I can't pretend to understand

3628
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:06,335
What is going on in his personal life

3629
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:09,151
But I mean if his wife is calling the police

3630
02:46:09,407 --> 02:46:09,919
Regarding

3631
02:46:10,175 --> 02:46:10,687
A fight that

3632
02:46:10,943 --> 02:46:11,967
They had

3633
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:14,271
Chance that you might be heading for a second divorce

3634
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:16,831
Like that could be a huge problem in his life

3635
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:20,159
But beyond that and that's just speculation had no f******

3636
02:46:20,415 --> 02:46:21,951
An idea about this

3637
02:46:22,207 --> 02:46:22,719
The real

3638
02:46:22,975 --> 02:46:24,255
World consequences of this

3639
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:25,023
I mean

3640
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:25,791
Boring

3641
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:28,351
The possibility that he has some secret DUIs on

3642
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:30,399
The past that we don't know about now it's like

3643
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:33,727
Make that would make this an actual escalated to a felony or something

3644
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:37,055
He's not going to have any consequences other than a fine

3645
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:39,615
Some minor inconvenience in his life

3646
02:46:40,383 --> 02:46:42,687
And if he gets a better lawyer you could probably get out of

3647
02:46:42,943 --> 02:46:43,711
Half of that City

3648
02:46:43,967 --> 02:46:46,271
Even if there is a possibility that he would get his license

3649
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:48,319
Since taken away which I don't think is the case

3650
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:53,183
He can afford to have his his audience can pay for his lift

3651
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:55,999
Or chauffeur

3652
02:46:56,511 --> 02:46:58,047
It's a it's a it's a

3653
02:46:58,303 --> 02:46:58,815
It's unfortunate

3654
02:46:59,071 --> 02:47:00,351
Because this is

3655
02:47:00,863 --> 02:47:01,887
It should be

3656
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:04,959
A situation where he recognizes like

3657
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:08,287
There's a larger thing going on in the world

3658
02:47:08,543 --> 02:47:09,823
And in his own life that

3659
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:10,591
Right there

3660
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:13,151
It should be some sort of a wake-up call but it's

3661
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:14,175
Probably not going to

3662
02:47:14,687 --> 02:47:16,991
There's no real consequence here other than

3663
02:47:17,503 --> 02:47:19,807
Possible embarrassment in the eyes of his audience

3664
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:23,135
And he can inoculate himself in that pretty easily

3665
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:23,903
His own

3666
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:24,671
Joe

3667
02:47:26,207 --> 02:47:27,487
If you're rich Rock Bottom is a

3668
02:47:27,743 --> 02:47:31,327
The long long long long long way down

3669
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:32,607
At a DUI.

3670
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:33,631
Close

3671
02:47:34,143 --> 02:47:35,935
It doesn't seem like like like what

3672
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:38,239
Jim irsay if you if you own the cult

3673
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:39,775
You can f****** kill people at

3674
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:41,055
App

3675
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:45,151
So anyway we get to the end of this and I mean obviously I think

3676
02:47:45,407 --> 02:47:46,431
That my intention

3677
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:47,967
For this episode was

3678
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:53,855
Sort of demonstrate the continuation of the nonsensical incoherent nature of the

3679
02:47:54,111 --> 02:47:55,647
The coronavirus Meredith yes

3680
02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:57,695
And we got

3681
02:47:58,207 --> 02:48:00,767
Well I mean almost hit by a drunk driver

3682
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:11,519
We got T-boned by Alex's Tuesday show and it turned into what it is

3683
02:48:13,823 --> 02:48:18,943
I mean I know the people really tired Ward for Great Line sex is there that one

3684
02:48:19,455 --> 02:48:20,991
Podcast over

3685
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:21,759
I know

3686
02:48:22,015 --> 02:48:23,807
The audience's incredibly tired as me

3687
02:48:24,063 --> 02:48:24,575

80s still my firm

3690
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:29,183
Conviction that Alex needs help

3691
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:30,207
And

3692
02:48:30,463 --> 02:48:31,487
I hope that he gets it

3693
02:48:31,743 --> 02:48:32,767
As much as I hate him

3694
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:33,535
And as much as I can

3695
02:48:33,791 --> 02:48:34,303
Think of you say

3696
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:35,071
Toxic

3697
02:48:35,583 --> 02:48:38,911
Cancerous thing in the world he's clearly

Expressing

3699
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:43,263
That is full of chaos and

3700
02:48:43,519 --> 02:48:44,031
Hurt

3701
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:46,335
And can be helped

3702
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:48,383
So

3703
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:50,943
That's the feeling I have and

3704
02:48:51,967 --> 02:48:52,479
I don't know

3705
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:54,015
I don't even know

3706
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:54,783
Man

3707
02:48:56,319 --> 02:48:58,367
I really want to just reiterate real quick

3708
02:48:58,623 --> 02:48:59,391
Mike Adams

3709
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:06,047
Except for that one Shining Moment where you told Alex to change the headline that

3710
02:49:06,303 --> 02:49:09,631
That is a nice job that was the one redeeming quality

3711
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:13,983
I realize that I think I forgot to play that

3712
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:14,751
Clip

3713
02:49:15,007 --> 02:49:17,055
Of Alex's second explanation

3714
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:19,871
For why you shaved his head I didn't hear the second

3715
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:21,919
Because he's jealous of Owen

3716
02:49:22,431 --> 02:49:27,807
Why should I have hair Superman I'll be Lex Luthor

3717
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:32,671
So anyway we will be back

3718
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:35,743
Another episode in the near future but until then we have wipes
