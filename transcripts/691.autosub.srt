1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Sit around and talk a little bit

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
What's Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,888
Question

8
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
What's today is

9
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,640
Care package

10
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Yes

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
A lot of Care Pack

12
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,624
Tonight

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Specifically made it clear that I was

14
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
What's up I gave you the pickles pickle relish

15
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
You're fine for me what's

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Sustains me is the heartfelt

17
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,920
Yeah it sounded all this chocolate that's all I can think about also

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
I'm confused by this

19
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:01,344
Yes there was a let everybody else decide whether or not

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,416
Kittens are going to eat kittens or if you should

21
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,512
So there is in this street

22
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
Pack of four cats

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Spaghetti just a

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
Purina Cat

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Tri-pac know for sure that the forecast

26
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
Along with it there's also something that looks like

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Their gummies

28
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
Called cotton candy kitten

29
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
I don't know if this is for cancer for human

30
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
And I'm I don't know what to do with this you wouldn't feed a giraffe animal cracker

31
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
That looked exactly like a giraffe that's just uncomfortable

32
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
It has allergies

33
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,352
Point of like it's Palm oil-free is

34
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
Palm oil something cats can't I have no idea

35
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
I don't either

36
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,592
I don't know I'm going to eat all the money I don't care

37
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,664
Squeeze

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
Is Dan yesterday my partner and I went out and played tennis

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
For a while immediately after we went to yoga which was really cool cuz we had a lot of exercise

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
But she has gotten

41
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Good

42
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Atena

43
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
Raphael good well I mean like

44
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
You're so good she's got

45
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,216
You like we started playing a few years ago and

46
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
Barely you know it was fun to hit the ball is so high and you know that be fun we were playing yesterday and she was kicking me

47
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
My apps

48
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
Like eventually I was like

49
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
I think I need to play hard

50
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
In order to

51
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Keep up with her

52
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
That's how good she

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
You've gotten well maybe she's been going easy on you the whole time and now it's finally f*** ever marry don't let it go off

54
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
Have I been getting played this entire time like this is the Ultimate Muscle

55
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Married to me before she can

56
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Yeah that was cheap

57
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
But she could not beat you at tennis before there was a ring on it

58
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,152
You know that makes sense a lot of women get to let you know they have those all the matter bad

59
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,712
So they're like let's not do this until we do

60
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
I got it

61
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
I mean I think it's who knows how you would respond

62
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
To being beaten atena

63
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Casino

64
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
Years to beat you up.

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
A beautiful racket at me

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Good heavens

67
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
Now that's not met any type of that time accountant

68
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Because I don't even like winning it makes me feel by

69
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Brightright

70
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Like you you feel bad I don't like what was that case I would be

71
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
I'd be worried about losing

72
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,175
I was growing up my oldest brother

73
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
He was the one who had the temper

74
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
And so that

75
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,319
And it was all competition to you know like he was

76
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Get kicked out of

77
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
Yeah yeah cuz he was so

78
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Competitive and angry whenever so

79
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
Since then I've grown up with

80
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
This kind of like

81
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Don't do that

82
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
And I go way too far the other

83
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
Yeah I had a friend

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,167
When I was younger who would like throw controllers and break them

85
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
And stuff like that when you lose at a game

86
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,799
And yeah that always kind of talked me earlier of like

87
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
You can control yourself and not break things

88
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,199
That's what I did Punch walls for a little while when I was when I was at my most

89
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Axiom's mentally ill what I was younger that's true but

90
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Line

91
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,375
As we discussed last episode

92
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,471
I would say wrapping up in terms of like a dedicated look

93
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
I'm at the response

94
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Uvalde shooting

95
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
On Alex's bar

96
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
I think there's a lot of people who

97
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
Probably thinking hey why don't

98
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
What you cover Alex's response to the January 6th

99
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
There's only one at the

100
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
Of the commission there's a whole season of the

101
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:51,487
True

102
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
But the issue is

103
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
On Thursday that's when the

104
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
The first hearing the Primetime hearing was

105
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
That day

106
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Owen was hosting

107
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,055
Friday the next day Owen was hosting

108
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
As always whenever there's something that is like

109
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Visit we need to hear Alex

110
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
It's batch

111
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
Let the let the minor-league guys take the first hit see what they've got to throw out there see what people throw back at him

112
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
And then Alex will take a crack at it and steady for water and honestly who knows if it's intentional at all but it definitely

113
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
He seems to be pretty consist

114
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
Whenever there is something that's like

115
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,959
Is going to be nuts well over three examples and that means

116
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
Did the pattern

117
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,335
Cigar like obviously

118
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Probably a coincidence

119
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,479
That's like when the new pope was named like Alex wasn't in studio

120
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:49,855
He's going to be named because it could be today or it could be tomorrow it is

121
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Notable

122
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
Alex is out of Studio whenever the things that are like

123
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,351
But he might have some really interesting commentary on this personal connection that emotion

124
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
Might get him to reveal things that maybe he should

125
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
Recording this on

126
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
On Sunday

127
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
And Alex baby

128
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,175
Hosting his shadow this evening but we don't know by the time we recording this and

129
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,783
He'll be impossible to flip it around so maybe we'll have a January 6th

130
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
Committee responsible thing on Wednesday

131
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Ideally

132
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
We'll see

133
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
We'll see what

134
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
If not maybe

135
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Space nonsense

136
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
I haven't gotten we have gone to pass for a while that's true we've been in

137
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
The present to require some

138
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Strip

139
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
June 6th

140
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
2022 is a day that

141
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
Something really notable happened on Alex

142
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Texas show interesting

143
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Should I

144
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
We talked about

145
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Before the show giving a teaser

146
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Baby shirt

147
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,975
Yeah you want to give it to you cuz this is what happened

148
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
It is so f***** up

149
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Mistake

150
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
And all over my face

151
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
And

152
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
Say that tube to Chillicothe ashamed of yourself

153
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,639
So Alex is ashamed of himself all over that face

154
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
No

155
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
No I don't regret I refuse to believe that Audi interior

156
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,927
There is a bit of a protracted

157
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
Quote on quote apology in this episode

158
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655

00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
We'll see

160
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
The path that we get

161
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
To the

162
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Apology

We're a couple of dudes who sit around and worship at the altar of ghosts and laugh at 1997

176
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Is this dramatic

177
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Pause

178
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Or else

00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
Paralysis headspaces in

188
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
At the job

189
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,855
Most people don't realize are living through extremely historical events

190
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Until it's already

191
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
And I'm not a good

192
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Dad

193
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Very optimistic

194
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
I think that's

195
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,751
Not true at all how is it that we're going to colonize space

196
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,847
The globalist plan is to kill all of us and then colonize face by themselves

197
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,199
Well because you have to defeat the globalist and then you'll be able to colonize space because you will have

198
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
Ask God's test of the devil that is the global

199
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
Okay throw this out there

200
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
More than one human

201
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Right cuz we assume the globalists are interdimensional demons

202
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
For the most

203
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
But they've got to have some humans working with

204
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
So they get off-planet

205
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
We're all human

206
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Did we techno

207
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Quickly get off when

208
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,055
I know because you're being possessed by the demons if you're working with the globalist

209
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Demon possession Works into your jeans and you're no longer human

210
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
Covid vaccine makes you a genetically modified organism

211
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,695
I think it'll probably be the same

212
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,023
Send it all over Forest

213
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
I would take issue with Alex

214
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
Explain that he's an optimist at me to

215
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
That's definitely does not say

216
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,007
Number of times he said we're all dead we are all dead it's hopeless

217
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
Even when he stopped

218
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Domestic it's like

219
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Maybe

220
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
Only then I will be able to strangle Klaus Schwab

221
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
The good scenario

222
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
Pessimistic

223
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
So

224
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Estranged space

225
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
As evidence

226
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Bye

227
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
Science has shown that there are other dimensions more powerful

228
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
Energetically than our own holding

229
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
Our dimension in place

230
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Show me the map

231
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Show me the map

232
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Lee

233
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
A controlled way

234
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
We know from history

235
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
We know from the Bible

236
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,119
We know from every other ancient texts as well and it home I found this one

237
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
No we don't

238
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
Everybody seen the meme that says

239
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Hard Times make strong men

240
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
Strong men make good times

241
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Good

242
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
X

243
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
Make weak man

244
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Weak man

245
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Make bad times

246
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
We had time she can reverse wow

247
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
That is

248
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Bull

249
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,959
So I think there's some interesting things that you can take away from this first

250
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Obviously this is

251
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
A little bit

252
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Silly

253
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
The space-time evil Dimensions proven by match

254
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
22 believe it

255
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,135
I think at the end of their with this meme that he has

256
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
Hard times

257
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Make

258
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
Strongman

259
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
I think that if you believe that

260
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
You to no longer believe like really in free will

261
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,447
Get like you have a pretty deterministic view of

262
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
Of stuff because essentially saying that

263
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Do who you are in the hardiness

264
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,431
But you have is determined by your circumstances there's nothing

265
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Good Times

266
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
Tuffman won't exist or whatever

267
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
I think that's a little bit silly to assume that everybody is

268
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Is just sort of blowing around in the Wind

269
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,743
Especially it silly if you believe the sort of stuff that I like

270
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,095
Yeah I mean compatible it doesn't really make sense to believe that

271
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,727
The times make a man if you believe that God created you with all of your characteristics already

272
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
Contact at the beginning

273
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Then the times make nothing

274
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
The times are simply where God plug

275
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
People in and out I guess

276
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,223
Yeah this this is a fine thing

277
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Bruh meme

278
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
I guess

279
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
I mean it's

280
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
It's sort of a way of

281
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
You know

282
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Contextualizing like

283
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Hey

284
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Things were tough

285
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,815
And I learn from them or whatever

286
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
People have to be tougher

287
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
In order to deal with

288
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Kind of an inspirational thing and if

289
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Keep trying to take it seriously

290
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
You're going to lose your mind

291
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Yeah

292
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:44,127
Yeah I get it I guess Alex is reach nirvana of some sort that like

293
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
Life is a cycle of death and rebirth

294
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,015
I would have you know I saw a heavily edited a icon

295
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Conversation so we know that's true

296
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,903
I think there's a weird that implication there too and that is

297
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
That like

298
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
Why would you

299
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
View fight

300
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
The death then

301
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
If it's just a part of the cycle that leads

302
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Do the next rebirth

303
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Like what's

304
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,191
The point make peace with the fact that the

305
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,567
Is death is coming and there will be a rebirth after work like is Alex really think that he

306
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
You capable of breaking the cycle of death and rebirth

307
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,527
What I mean is the wheel of the wheel of retardation I really think that next time Alex

308
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
She's not going to come back the way that he

309
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
He thinks he is

310
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:30,719
I definitely if you believe in reincarnation yes I definitely believe that that is the case

311
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
I'll tell you that right now come back as one of the kids

312
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
Children

313
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
You are your ancestors

314
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,263
I think there's a lot of convoluted nonsense going on here but

315
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
B b c this cycle

316
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
It continues and here's where we are man

317
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Birdman make

318
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Good Times

319
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,855
That's a simple way to go over to cycle but it is a known cycle

320
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
The humans have behaved in this way over and over again

321
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
What always happens

322
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,351
People start cheating on their husbands and wives

323
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,911
What people start having sex with the same sex

324
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
What

325
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,239
People that do that

326
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Children I want to have sex with him

327
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Then

328
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
I want to start sacrificing children

329
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Well we're here

330
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,671
Ladies and gentlemen sacrificing children

331
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,023
I think that I think you're right that it is Judgement

332
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
I think I personally for your behavior what you are is the harbinger of attentive

333
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
What I do. Listen it's not personal bright you're just an example of how all men are weakened the going

334
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
Going to die in this time.

335
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,783
People having same-sex relationships is is a sign of the end time

336
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
This is silly and

337
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Defensive

338
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Clearly based in

339
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,255
A bigotry that he has an lgbtq community

340
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
I do think that if he wants me to take this at all seriously then he needs to have as much anger as he does towards

341
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
Drag queen story time anybody hoochie

342
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
Cheats on their spouse

343
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
He needs to have that as a

344
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
Consistency

345
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,199
Cheating on your spouse is also a heartbreak a harbinger of the Season X then

346
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
You care a lot about that

347
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
Infidelity Alex

348
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Nope

349
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:40,511
Are you remarried you still be with your first wife

350
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
But yeah

351
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,191
I don't know why I find this insincere and just sort of a rationalization for him to be able

352
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
To attack the communities that he wants to attack

353
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,615
Yeah I mean the problem there is if you start looking at history

354
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
You'll start

355
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,967
Looking at that strong men weak men Meme and then start looking

356
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Matriarchal

357
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Society sets

358
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,063
Function of happiness in our joyful

359
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
And you're like oh man

360
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Maybe we should not have the men part

361
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Maybe that's why the cycle keeps happening is

362
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Could you keep caring about men

363
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Hartman wiechmann doesn't matter

364
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
I think also the

365
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,007
Some of that perception about the Hardman coming hard times or whatever like

366
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Probably a lot of that has to do with our

367
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Storytelling

368
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
Play whe

369
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
Hero worship

370
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
I would assume that it has a lot to do with folklore

371
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
And then meth

372
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,879
But yeah so there's sacrificing children

373
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
What he means by that

374
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Because he doesn't mean it literally although he wants the audio

375
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Be like yeah

376
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
We're here

377
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Ladies and gentlemen

378
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,191
Gay strip bar in Dallas this weekend

379
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,823
Neon sign saying it's not going to lick itself behind little children

380
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
All sorts of other pornographic statements

381
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,743
So what other what other sexually obscene slogans were there on the walls and like

382
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
I don't like it

383
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
I guess if he wants to claim that

384
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
You can but

385
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,215
This wasn't like a strip show at all there's a there's a drag show in Dallas

386
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,543
It was at a bar that is true it is part of pride

387
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,663
But it was during the day as evidenced by the large number of adults

388
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
Groomer at people outside the venue

389
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,343
Pictures of

390
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,183
It said it's not going to lick itself

391
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,767
If this is a sign that's from a popular ice cream shop in Dallas

392
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
It's called cauldron ice cream

393
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,911
Grape it's their slogan it caught on it's really popular they have me on a hind

394
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Yeah that they sell

395
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
People enjoy them

396
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,823
Maybe if I were the event organizers I would have considered taking that.

397
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,407
But ultimately it's not that big of a deal and maybe they couldn't

398
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
Take it down but maybe it's installed really well on the wall

399
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
And the bar wouldn't let the

400
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,647
It was that big of a deal cuz I don't know if it is

401
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,256
I think everyone there was probably aware that that's a slogan of the ice cream shop

402
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
It's super popular in town

403
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,448
So it wouldn't necessarily have as much of a hard sexual innuendo to the people that are there they would have

404
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
Familiarity with more of a soft sexual innuendo

405
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,688
I don't know I guess if that's child sacrifice

406
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
I don't know I don't know what

407
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
This is pathetic

408
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
Three-year-old is capable of understanding concepts

409
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
They can read

410
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
That's possible

411
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
I'm not saying the three-year-olds can't read

412
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
However

413
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,816
The concept of soft sexual innuendo

414
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Seems a little bit

415
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,960
Beyond them that's just me I am not an expert on raising children cuz I have not interacted

416
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
Two children a quite a while

417
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,056
But I do remember that when I was in

418
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
Middle School

419
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
I rode bus 69 to school

420
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
And people made jokes about it

421
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
What

422
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,552
Call

423
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Pretty blunt

424
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Decent

425
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:23,232
Popular ice cream shop where this is that their slogan

426
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
Yeah people might

427
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
The kids might just be like a nice cream

428
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
Great I don't know anyways I don't think it's that big of a deal

429
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,288
Alex complains a bit about all of his

430
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Is animes

431
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,128
And he just gets mad that the devil worship

432
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,432
Going to go on a while

433
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
But I just want people to feel

434
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
This

435
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
We don't we don't

436
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Experience this

437
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Much on the show

438
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
Turn it off after inactivity

439
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,232
I've spoiled it there's an ad

440
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
We're just disbelieve in this here we go

441
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
Devil worshipping pedophiles

442
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,704
Every cell in my body wants to get them off our children

443
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,312
Do it without you and you can't do it without me

444
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
We can do anything

445
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
We will

446
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,696
Devil sends the Beast with rice

447
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
That's because he knows his time is short

448
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
Let he who have understanding reckon the number of the Beast

449
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
For it is the number of a man

450
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
666

451
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
42

452
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
Someone hit that she cannot ignore this all ties together

453
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
Most important working forces ever done it down here

454
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,016
Sponsoring us

455
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
Read worse than I thought

456
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
Play off half our crew as we speak this month

457
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Literally

458
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
I don't want to get into the red again

459
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
Real quick will get back to this but

460
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:13,824
I really do feel Alex's mentioning that he's big donors essentially saved his

461
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Ability to do the show

462
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
You need to disclose who these

463
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,224
These people are conflicts of interest

464
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,784
I don't think that this is the case

465
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,136
But because he doesn't disclose who these people are you have to like start taking

466
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Who could it be

467
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:33,024
Someone who's willing to drop $8000000 in Bitcoin on this f****** idiot

468
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,376
Alex says that all of these billionaires and all these really rich

469
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
People in the elite

470
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
They're all lined up in the side of the globalist

471
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
Except for Elon Musk

472
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Which is normal for a lie

473
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,104
But then the other name he throws in his Peter

474
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Teal

475
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,736
I don't think the Peter teal is the person who gave him the money but like

476
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
Because he won't disclose

477
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Who this donor is

478
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
It makes you think

479
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,464
Peter Thiel is someone who probably could have access to millions of dollars of Bitcoin

480
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
It seems like

481
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,560
That is a possible person and if it is

482
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
Their implied reasons

483
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,216
You would give Alex that money in order to bail him out of trouble

484
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
And so

485
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,568
He needs to disclose who this person is for the sake of

486
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,920
The Integrity of his show the imaginary Integrity Odyssey I guess

487
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
But yeah that that troubled me a little bit

488
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
2020

489
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
I've not heard him say like posit

490
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Little things about Peter

491
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,904
Imagine him doing that I like literally

492
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
Peter teal exist as they've almost

493
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,864
Prototype of globalists that Alex believes it is responsible for a very chill

494
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Effect on fries

495
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
He's a monster

496
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Yeah it's an absolute

497
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:53,920
Do I know you did that I'm in no no not many people challenge Champion evil quite as well as

498
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,248
I'm safe from Alex's perspective

499
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:01,344
Yeah you was in the truck

500
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,024
What's the temperature in slapton infowarsstore.com there's a link

Patriots out there with us

516
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:39,648
Memorial Day special is going to have to go another day or two cuz I just don't know what I'm going to have for sale here

517
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
This goes on like

518
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
3 more minutes

519
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
Incessant

520
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
It's so long

521
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Why

522
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
Do I feel like I'm getting like a

523
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
Middle Ground between an apology and a

524
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,728
Sales pitch in an apology for the sales pitch

525
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,544
It's low energy it's

526
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
Here's the here's the thing

527
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Be

528
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:06,272
Introduction of this is that like yelling about how he hates the demon pedophiles and what-have-you in

529
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
You can't

530
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Beat them without me

531
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
And then this leads into this

532
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Tracted sales pitch

533
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,024
About how the the Memorial Day sales still in effect

534
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
Easter sale for not having a different name for the sale

535
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
Which is essentially going to be the exact same

536
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
I have a spoiler to

537
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:33,664
Alex never has time to make a new special that happens all the time

538
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,992
He's constantly being like all know I haven't had time to make a new sale

539
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
It is just a new name

540
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,928
How many weeks away from Christmas in July special so what do we do with Apple pay.

541
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,768
It can't be like oh we're doing pride month special nope can't do that one

542
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Interesting

543
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,888
Motorcycle made him do it

544
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,680
Turn around that would be

545
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,984
He doesn't entire segment

546
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
That is just a

547
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
And

548
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Larry very much a bummer

549
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
Also

550
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
Different points

551
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,456
In the show he does have a different amounts of those coins

552
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:14,112
Still available very distrusting of how well these are moving available

553
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,720
10% there's like half left

554
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
I'll be at LACMA

555
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
The reality is

556
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
Let me just start going into it here

557
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
And

558
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,080
H1 properly I don't give a contact in my view

559
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:44,576
News articles yourself and decide what you think's going on

560
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
I feel like it's bizarre that Alex can spend an entire segment on ads and then be I got too much news to

561
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Get into so much

562
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
News

563
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Fine I guess

564
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
But

565
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,032
I find it fascinating that Alex thinks

566
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,848
What he's describing isn't what he just does all the time

567
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,736
I'm going to read some headlines I'm going to respond it for a second and I don't give a f*** you can go read it read it

568
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,808
Decide if I'm right or wrong

569
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,368
Alright then nothing happens nothing gets done

570
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
There's no progress nobody understands anything better

571
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
I don't know what that's like

572
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:27,328
Not his normal day at work I would like to hear him describe what he does

573
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
You know like what Alice

574
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Today I've got too much news

575
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,960
So I can't do what I normally do

576
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,264
Which is dig into each store

577
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
I think he thinks that he does that really

578
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
Maybe

579
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
I can't I can't imagine

580
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,272
I mean he doesn't even realize it when he has a sack

581
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
Of news articles that would bring it out

582
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,416
And they're all the same story with different headlines from different

583
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Like places

584
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
He doesn't do anything

585
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,816
It's all just improv based on

586
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
The headlines as suggestion

587
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
Yeah but the part that's written

588
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
Is the part where he says that he

589
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
He's almost going to do the difference

590
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:10,848
I need to make a new sales

591
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
Interesting

592
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
I don't have to deal with this

593
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
White supremacy

594
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,832
As rare as a leprechaun accent

595
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
Leprechaun

596
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Alex believe I'm leprechaun

597
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
So

598
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,560
Somebody saw a leprechaun

599
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Okay

600
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
So

601
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
He stated as fact

602
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,544
Somebody saw a leprechaun once so now everybody believes in leprechauns

603
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Somebody saw a leprechaun what's going on

604
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
I mean

605
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:53,088
But it doesn't mean I can't just say the leprechaun

606
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,648
It's an interesting way for Alex

607
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
2

608
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,816
What you were saying is if his rare is a leprechaun realize leprechauns don't exist

609
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:09,216
Supremacy doesn't exist

610
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Ariel

611
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,824
Or white supremacy is not I saw that series of documentaries

612
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,176
There was one where the leprechaun went to the hood

613
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,112
What is it

614
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Hellboy

615
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
The Alex believe

616
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,256
Yeah and he doesn't believe in the most

617
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
Common ideology

618
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
What's up

619
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
Yeah it would be like if there were leprechauns all over the place

620
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,336
F****** kick you couldn't walk without kicking three or four leprechauns

621
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,944
Like a General Mills got canceled for having Lucky Charms

622
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
Baby like leprechauns would open windows and toss chamber pots filled with gold on top of your head

623
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,904
You wouldn't be able to walk without having an umbrella

624
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
Set of tiktok we'd have

625
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,536
Riddles

626
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:12,704
Do leprechauns leprechauns do not tell riddles

627
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,520
So Alex a lot of this is

628
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
Dominant sense

629
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
But they're also it a lot of

630
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Beginning of the show on

631
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Ends up getting into

632
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
Little bit hurt by

633
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
His example

634
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,928
Hundreds of Publications Reuters AP Newark

635
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,120
Thrown out of Bankruptcy Court by the justice department for being a criminal

636
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
Huge victory for the

637
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
Real companies

638
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
Devastating

639
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
For the truth

640
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
And everything's there still

641
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Shooting

642
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,672
But

643
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Is he is that

644
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,608
The table right now

645
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,752
Alex Jones

646
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,712
So we dropped me with Abby Lee bankruptcy total victory

647
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
This isn't at all accurate

648
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
We

649
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:39,744
To sum up Alex attempted to file bankruptcy for 3 his companies that don't actually exist

650
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Except on paper

651
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,816
3chi real company

652
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
That was a little funny

653
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,448
Companies were among the name

654
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,496
Defendants in the case against Alex

655
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:54,080
Because it was really unclear how his businesses were

656
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,152
But none of these companies even do any business

657
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
Alex drive to bankruptcy

658
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,784
These companies because he knew that doing so would put a halt on the trial for damages and

659
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Sandy Hook cases

660
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,648
Which is why you filed days before the trial was set to begin Intex

661
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,792
It was a desperate move on his part because he knew that was the only way he could buy time and ultimately because

662
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
The companies he was bankrupt

663
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
Didn't have any assets

664
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
It wouldn't make any difference to him if he did

665
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:26,080
Because that was the case and because of the new awareness of these companies that they aren't really real

666
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:32,480
The plaintiffs decided that they could drop these two companies from the lawsuit as a way to make it to Alex's bankrupting of them

667
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
That wouldn't affect

668
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
His ability to move forward

669
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
There wasn't anything that they could collect

670
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,672
From these companies on judgment anyway so it didn't matter

671
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
To drop those company

672
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Cheapest from the suit it didn't

673
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
It's a 0

674
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,376
The trial itself got postponed still and that was obviously the goal

675
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,704
There's really no reason to continue with

676
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
The charade of the bankruptcy

677
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,848
The plane just dropped the you not existing companies from the suit and Alex withdrew the bankruptcy

678
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,664
Huiclaims so the case can now move forward and

679
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,504
None of it like it's basically like none of this would ever happen when it pulled

680
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,576
None of this matters in terms of what's coming for Ally

681
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:15,232
The soup being dropped against Infowars means nothing since he's still personally being sued and so is his actual company

682
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Free Speech this

683
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,912
Is he now tries to move a bunch of money or assets around to these other companies that got dropped from the suit could be pretty apparent what he's doing

684
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
Likely result

685
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
In further legal issue

686
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:32,640
Yeah he's been sounds good if you know nothing about the case like his audience almost certainly does but if you've been following this

687
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
Is it all this is just complete bulshit

688
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
And

689
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:39,296
You know that he knows he's lying there is no way you could say these things

690
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
Sincerely real company

691
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
Right what is that

692
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,744
Say it say that in any way that isn't obviously you saying that these are fake

693
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,560
Right yeah it's it's a Patel

694
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
Companies

695
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Sprite

696
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
Operation

697
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,496
But you had didn't specifically say to me

698
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
They were key real company I must insist

699
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
What is that I must insist

700
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,152
His company is very real

701
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,760
Do you have teeth fake companies as well because of the important fake company

702
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,832
And Alex Alex G a bunch about how like

703
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
I tried to open up my books to

704
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:20,512
To show them that I don't have the money they think I do more seriously if he bankrupted himself

705
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,120
Speed systems didn't do that and that's the reason the trial

706
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,704
Is coming up at the end of July and he's going

707
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,056
Facts about matter that these fees other

708
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
But he's depressed

709
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
By whom

710
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
The system

711
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
The last few months

712
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Jones is a fraud

713
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
Jones has filed a criminal bankruptcy

714
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Jones

715
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,008
One document

716
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
There supposed to be a deliberative body

717
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
They're supposed to get

718
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
About

719
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
They smoke their own dope

720
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
And drop

721
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,624
Angler challenges against our main companies

722
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
Hakeem a real company

723
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,864
My mouth is a lie like them

724
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
When everything I do is try

725
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
The lady doth protest too much

726
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Wild

727
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
Is a little this is a little dumb

728
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,952
I know you are but what am I is a lot shorter way of saying that

729
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
It's really uncomfortable to

730
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
To hear a man

731
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
Use a lot more words

732
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,120
To say I'm Rubber and you're glue right

733
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
3 something

734
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,336
Compelling about this if you're a listener of the show Infowars LLC

735
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,432
Because the company is named Infowars everyone calls it in

736
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,528
The does a logos

737
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Be

738
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,392
Notion that the Infowars itself was dropped from the suit

739
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Would give

740
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
People that

741
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,256
Perception that like that is the main real company but it's not

742
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
No

743
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Yeah it's

744
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,424
I see the value of the spin that he's using

745
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
For his audiences

746
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:42,080
But it's also a deliberate choice to name a shell company

747
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
A fake

748
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,176
Akeem fake company after the name of your actual business

749
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
I don't know

750
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
Anyway

751
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
At least people

752
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
They think that I'm a liar

753
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
Just a liar

754
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,904
I'm not a liar

755
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,000
No now I've done almost 700 episodes of a podcast

756
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Thoroughly

757
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Talking

758
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,608
Maybe too much

759
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
About the Myriad lies

760
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
But he tells like

761
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
There's some repetition in our show

762
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Not that much

763
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
Not as much as well

764
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
It's not like

765
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,968
We talked about the same bulshit everyday

766
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,784
We really don't it's a new one

767
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,136
Fabulous lives

768
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,696
Literally

769
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
Losers

770
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
We're good

771
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,448
How many lies you spew

772
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,800
And there's millions and millions every day in millions more every week

773
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,664
Because they know they're getting their best shot

774
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
I'll tell you

775
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,744
These people just think up the biggest lies they can

776
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Now they screw people

777
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,608
I don't want to live anymore

778
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,240
If Alex wants to know like what he's got wrong so we can do better I have

779
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,824
700 episodes of a podcast

780
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
I I mean

781
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
It is

782
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,224
It's one of those things where we've developed

783
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Atone

784
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
A voice

785
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,088
You know over centuries and thousands of years

786
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
In order to communicate emotions

787
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Since you know that

788
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,928
Wait wait without words

789
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,744
At no point in time in human history

790
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
Has a good person

791
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
Never been like

792
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,608
Up in your face screaming

793
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
We're good

794
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,216
And you've been like yeah that sounds right

795
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,032
It seems rare

796
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,895
I'm not saying it's not possible right I bet I bet it's some point it is having baby in the Wild West

797
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,991
Everybody was rough I'm going to throw this out at you in the Bible

798
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
Which he's supposedly likes you know that whole like

799
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Don't say you're a good person

800
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,183
People know because you do things that make them think you're a good purse

801
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:12,863
Instead

802
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,519
Faster there weren't a radio show in the Bible right

803
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
It's true

804
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,639
What all would never have become Paul if he had a radio show

805
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:29,247
So Alex would never walk along a road

806
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,855
Nope this is the context that brings

807
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
Alex's

808
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Apology

809
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:42,559
Essentially he is in the state where he's complaining about the media lying about him and his cases fry all this

810
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,095
Be honest

811
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
I am not a liar about

812
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
Striving

813
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Right act

814
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Into that leads him

815
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
2

816
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
His

817
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
I have egg on my face

818
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,591
Yeah I am ashamed before we get to

819
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,175
Alex just have to discuss his own weaknesses a little bit

820
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
Interested

821
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,247
You don't think I don't know

822
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,527
Karma is real

823
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
What

824
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,167
That's why we're so different from these people

825
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031
I'm going to get pissed and Bash somebody

826
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
We're good

827
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
I got to keep that under control

828
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
Pressure

829
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
My mind

830
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
Sometimes

831
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,559
I couldn't control that make mistakes

832
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Far fewer now

833
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
Maybe your perception is just different

834
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,031
Maybe you're really rich and surrounded by people who don't check you anymore and you are

835
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Still making the

836
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
Exact same missile analyses

837
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,711
Of whether or not the things you're doing or good

838
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
What you can

839
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,527
Can do so there's two ways to go about this

840
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
Alright

841
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
You can

842
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Do good things

843
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
And then people go wow

844
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
You're doing good things

845
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Or

846
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,231
You can give people a lot of money to say you're doing good

847
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
Thanks better than options

848
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Same thing

849
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,327
I think I think we got a

850
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Titleist

851
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
Fear of Alex

852
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Intensity violin

853
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
What's the f*** ever

854
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:29,567
Sometimes his brain tells him evil is good

855
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
I don't see somebody who is

856
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Even when

857
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,039
Trying to make sense of the world in a way that is like

858
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,623
Like I'm I know I'm telling you a lie

859
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:49,023
Right now and my brain is telling me that that's actually good

860
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
So f****** confused

861
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
This is Atkins

862
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Fuse

863
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
Scared boy

864
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,471
A billion billion dollars and a radio show

865
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,799
It's really really shows the danger of Dentistry

866
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,127
Cuz he came do you get a rich dentist dad

867
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,735
Enables your b******* you know what it is is here's what it is

868
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,831
Exactly it is the Twilight Zone episode where the kid has the second

869
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
Powerzen

870
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
Adults all around him are just

871
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
Enslaved to that child wins

872
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,023
You don't do anything wrong and you might turn into a lamp

873
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,071
Dealing with with Ali

874
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
If that kid grew up

875
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,399
And everybody was like well I guess we just live

876
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,727
Just now thinking about you

877
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,311
Be happening if it wasn't for 911

878
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
Alex's career would not exist

879
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
Really without that long stretch of

880
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,271
Building up a weird Community around 9-11 truther is

881
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,367
He would still exist but like

882
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,927
Mostly on shortwave or something I can that

883
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
You know it Manish right area like I don't think he has the capability to keep did write a book

884
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
The appeal of like a Behold a Pale Horse

885
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
He's no Bill Cooper on that level

886
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
Notary

887
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
And maybe

888
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
The terrorists wanted

889
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,127
Maybe all along is a long game

890
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,967
They did 9/11 in order to facilitate the creation of a

891
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
I want to hinge

892
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
Conspiracy theorist in Texas

893
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:21,183
In order to destabilize democracy I'm not joking when I say I really do think that

894
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:27,583
That's going to be going down is it like the most successful terror attack in history because if you are

895
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,887
Destroy the United States

896
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,447
It's hard to believe that everything we've done to

897
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
Since 9/11 has not

898
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
Gone that direction

899
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
Going through my head trying to think of

900
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Two other

901
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
Terrorist attacks

902
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:44,735
Dear me there is like a recently by us and we lived through it so like

903
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,319
Leave me to be like well maybe not but I would I can think of

904
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:52,671
You know I don't mean successful in terms of like compact Philemon

905
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,743
Exactly like in real terms

906
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
That event

907
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
Stoked

908
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,631
Everything that led to where we are now the militarization of police

909
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
Ice Homeland Security

910
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,983
The f****** of rise of the far-right

911
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,823
The massive amount of islamophobia leading all the way back

912
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,895
Lgbtq homophobia all the way back

913
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:19,295
Like it goes all the way around and it all happened around that one specific thing I have a lot of faith in

914
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
Being unable to

915
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,903
To create bad situations that I have some

916
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,487
I have to hold on to believe that we would have got to a terrible place

917
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:31,071
Even without it

918
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,399
I think you could see a lot of the the soda ripplewave

919
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
From that

920
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,031
Play I was just trying to make a joke about the terrorist wanted to

921
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:44,383
To create Alex go

922
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:49,247
So Alex is really bent out of shape about how everyone's lying about his court case

923
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,831
Even though they're telling the truth about it and he's lying but they're lying so he

924
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
He's telling the truth

925
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:57,951
But in order to like really make it real that he tries

926
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
To do a good job stripes

927
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
That leaves us

928
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,791
Us to where we had our cliffhanger

929
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
I made a mistake

930
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
And

931
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
Always right

932
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
And

933
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
I'm ashamed of myself

934
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,887
Don't say that tube to Chillicothe look he's ashamed of yourself

935
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
That's how I feel

936
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Good

937
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,127
I wish you felt that way more generally

938
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,431
Yeah they're supposed to like in this very

939
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
Niche

940
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
Yaser fake situation

941
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,087
As we look at this apology I think we're very clearly going

942
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,647
To see he is not apologizing for anything

943
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:06,559
Transitioning a narrative also you blaming everybody but himself

944
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,143
And he was driving and he just got bad information from all the Liars out

945
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
Subway

946
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
Some summer someone that's part of his

947
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:21,407
That's that's amazing to me I mean obviously has to be that he's not actually a shame

948
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Country ideas

949
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
That he

950
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,759
Could be like ashamed

951
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,111
In terms of like what a relative of shame mean

952
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,159
Is you know like what

953
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,975
Is my shame relative to what that man must

954
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:40,607
Feel if he feel shaky feels no shame I think I think we need to talk about I feel ashamed

955
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
The missed

956
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
Right I think that's one of these

957
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
Really expressing is like

958
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
I wish on this one there was another

959
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,871
There's another way I could have covered this ripe really think I f***** up based on my own brand

960
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,663
Right that's basically what

961
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
The long and short of what we're going to get

962
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,479
Yeah I mean

963
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,295
He's going to say

964
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
The first episode

965
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
This is this is

966
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:09,023
Completely alien to Alex's coverage he's going to apologize for trying to tell the truth yes

967
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
That's exactly what he's going to do yeah and also that he was too tired to go to U-Haul

968
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Aldi

969
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,007
You was going to go because too tired

970
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
Hours

971
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,135
Just want to believe in Texas and I want to believe employee Shall Believe in the system

972
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
And

973
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,447
I'm out that it was a lie

974
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
I just

975
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
Lazily went along with it

976
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:57,663
How to make clear before Alex tries to do any kind of apologizing

977
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:03,807
The first is that he did not just go along with the mainstream official narrative which happened to end up being inaccurate

978
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:10,207
How it was all over the place treating 4chan hoaxes as serious reporting and making up at the shooting wasn't shooting

979
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,999
Was really a hostage situation

980
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:17,375
Alex can easily be forgiven for the things that he missed reported based on faulty information that is coming

981
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
From official sources

982
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,751
Did he expect anyone to take his Corrections / Pieology seriously

983
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
He needs to actually understand what

984
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
He did that was wrong

985
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:31,199
He'll never do that because it really penetrates his entire facade if he lets the audience in on the front

986
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,247
Secret to be just making s*** up all the time

987
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
The second thing that's important to point out here is that Alex is literally admitting on-air that he reported information that he knew to be in

988
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,951
Accurate because he didn't want to criticize

989
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:47,839
Alex recognize that the lasting all of his imagined enemies are being very critical of the police

990
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
So he tried to be the opposite

991
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,983
That defending the police even when he knew he was saying was a lie

992
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:59,103
If you listen to this show and you take Alex at all seriously this should be a massive wake-up call

993
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
This is not

994
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Alexandra got something wrong

995
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,503
It seems saying that he actively and knowingly lied on air because

996
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,551
It was better for the position he wanted

997
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
The take

998
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:14,207
Hit me feel like he's doing the correction and that somehow indicates that this is a unique situation but that's nonsense

999
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,535
He's already couching this as an apology for

1000
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
Stating the mainstream media's narrative

1001
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,703
We just pretend to take responsibility will ultimately Shifting the blame away from yourself

1002
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
Onto them

1003
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,543
Well I mean he literally just said

1004
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
That it was

1005
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
Lazily

1006
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,943
I love we reported Lakeside report allies

1007
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,503
I knew those were false

1008
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,063
But then I went along with the official story

1009
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Lazily

1010
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,415
That's a thing you can do

1011
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,999
Oh no I was just too lazy to tell the truth

1012
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,047
Today so I figured what I do

1013
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
Is go with the official lie

1014
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,679
Afara far more reasonable thing to say in a situation like this is

1015
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
I mean like what

1016
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,287
Most media Outlets would probably say and that is

1017
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,615
You know we got reporting that came from sources

1018
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,431
Cuz that's our official

1019
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
We

1020
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,503
Didn't have an Avenue to dig

1021
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,575
Further into this right the very serious situation

1022
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,367
It's our first time discovering this

1023
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
The cops lie

1024
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:19,999
We've never seen that before so it's really blowing our minds you know right

1025
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Here's the thing

1026
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,351
Even though a lot of outlets Miss cover this in terms of like

1027
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,399
Basic factual information

1028
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
They also were reporting

1029
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
This is what

1030
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,751
Bespoke

1031
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
People are telling us

1032
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,823
Which

1033
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:34,847
He's true

1034
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,943
When they say in the basic level that is true when they say reported

1035
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,503
Official sources have said

1036
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
They're not

1037
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Sing the more making it up

1038
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,903
They're not coming up with their own narrative and then saying

1039
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:54,559
Heating beneficial bears as a way of taking stock of that

1040
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,095
After the fact

1041
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
The mistake that was made

1042
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,423
Easy to dinner

1043
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
Take an inventory of the

1044
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
The things that we're done

1045
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,799
Alex can't do that because in reality

1046
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,615
Recognizing the things that he did

1047
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,431
The same as other media Outlet

1048
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
One thing that he didn't even bring up

1049
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
He said it was the media lie

1050
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,831
He said it's the media line he didn't bring up the

1051
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
The cops themselves were like

1052
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,183
He kind of touches on that a little bit later

1053
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:26,559
But it is a murky gray area for him because everything needs to be the media's fault

1054
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,863
It's got to be the media who is lying but they were

1055
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,655
You know it's all stelter

1056
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
Map somehow of course

1057
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:38,079
Yep I knew it's yet he's going to he's going to tell you all about it right after

1058
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,103
Commercial messages

1059
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,551
Arkansas processor we're all having

1060
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
Uvalde smells bad

1061
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
Alright

1062
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:01,375
Volkswagen

1063
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:09,055
When we've ever gotten to the place we were always going to

1064
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,079
Right

1065
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:16,479
I mean it's an inevitability the sun rises you have to pay taxes and now she's going to say something will f****** false flag

1066
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,063
So long

1067
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:27,487
When I see this being treated as like an apology or correction I really really don't feel like that

1068
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,255
Is what they say

1069
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:34,143
It is a I could have gotten away with calling this a false flag and look at all of these Dynamics

1070
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:39,007
That would have really fed into my ability to grandstand and I didn't

1071
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Because

1072
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Oh Sandy Hook

1073
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,591
Maybe

1074
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:51,295
Maybe it's cuz he's proud of Texas

1075
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,343
Call Freeway Auto

1076
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,183
School shooting where you are already being sued for lying about 1

1077
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,463
You don't like

1078
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
His time and it turns out this is the perfect

1079
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
And only time to lie I have

1080
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
This friend of mine

1081
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
Who is the parent of Liberty

1082
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Veronica

1083
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:15,103
If he tells me that it is not because of the lawsuit okay you literally and we'll hear that a little bit later

1084
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,175
Colfer f***

1085
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:21,247
The only reason you would say it's not because of a lawsuit

1086
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
Because you know it's because of

1087
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:27,135
And you know that everybody is going to Steve.

1088
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
Obviously

1089
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
So Alex comes back from break

1090
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
And

1091
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,791
I think he has some pretty dumb thought

1092
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
Real quick

1093
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:46,847
Through the glass Darkly rose-colored glasses

1094
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,783
No amount of

1095
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
When the tragic event

1096
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
Unfold it in Uvalde Texas

1097
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,911
Publications everywhere

1098
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:14,239
Will Alshon say this is a false flag

1099
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,639
I know I don't always stay

1100
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:26,271
Publications everywhere

1101
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,087
I can't imagine how narcissists

1102
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
Sick you have to be to think

1103
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,671
That the first thing on people's minds

1104
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,999
Like who are in the media wouldn't

1105
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,839
Might be one of the first things on my mind

1106
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,655
Short but I am in a very nice paste

1107
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
It is not the

1108
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
Thing on my mind

1109
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
The tragedy is

1110
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
Obviously

1111
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
Far more

1112
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,847
Important then

1113
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
Sorry about this

1114
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,687
Eventually

1115
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,503
I will for sure but that's something that you have to get

1116
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:01,855
Like something in the garage that you have to go pick up and you have to

1117
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,159
Mow the lawn your first thought

1118
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,207
It's not oh I better go mow the lawn

1119
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,863
After I get over the the horror of the the situation and try to get a handle on like what's going on

1120
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
She'll be like

1121
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,911
And it's not like I

1122
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,983
My engine is more like

1123
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,663
F*** Alex is going to be an a****** like whatever it is going to be awful to listen to

1124
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:32,319
Opening up those are those episode we were not earned if he was going to say that it's a false

1125
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,415
It's like we were concerned that he was going to blame somebody who is trans

1126
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,487
Who had nothing to do with that night

1127
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:44,351
We're worried about not whether or not you think it's a false f******

1128
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
Can plaque

1129
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,911
Is who are you going to hurt

1130
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,703
Because of it yeah yeah

1131
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:54,335
Yeah I bet it is again just like a manifestation of his narcissism

1132
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:59,199
Quite frankly the way that he's behaving here already on this apology

1133
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,735
The idea that people would

1134
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,319
I have a reason to speculate whether or not he's going to call football

1135
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,623
Absurd

1136
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,743
So Alex thinks he was just covering what the mainstream media was putting out which again

1137
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
It's absolutely not

1138
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,583
Even his mind yes just because he made up

1139
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,375
Some stuff along the way that's just him

1140
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:22,751
Adding a little Zuzu as it's bleeding between the Lions

1141
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,287
Maybe if you're really Jenner

1142
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,359
We have the

1143
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:31,199
Buffalo white supremacist shooter turns out was in constant communication

1144
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,247
With a former federal agent

1145
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,039
That obviously leads to

1146
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
Obvious

1147
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
Isn't the reason

1148
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
Two weeks ago

1149
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,607
On Tuesday after it happened

1150
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,751
Hero border patrol agent killed him

1151
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,287
12 minutes

1152
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,383
I'm in well we're not sure and

1153
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,735
Who's 45 minutes

1154
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,295
75 minutes

1155
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:13,695
But they stood outside the state police local police all of them and held the families back and they lied about it

1156
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,303
I was misled

1157
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
And the governor said he was misled

1158
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,399
I said okay looks like

1159
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
I should have gone down there

1160
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,591
And I should have interview people like I used to do

1161
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:35,199
It's interesting to think there's a chance that Alex really thinks that all he was doing was reporting

1162
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,223
What the media covered

1163
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
There's a small possibility that's really what

1164
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
He feels but it's not true

1165
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:46,463
The night of the shooting Alex's coverage wasn't based on any news it was based on a transfer obok 4chan hopes and his major consistency

1166
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,767
That the shooter was on mind control psych meds

1167
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,607
Somebody was making up and wasn't based on any reporting any still camping

1168
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
Street now

1169
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,703
He did get something's wrong because of Miss statements by official

1170
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
No reason to expect

1171
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
Intuit known

1172
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
There what he was saying was an act

1173
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,199
That has happened bit but

1174
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,735
Larger picture a lot of

1175
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,271
The stuff he's been wrong about art

1176
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,807
Things that he was wrong about

1177
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
Because I'm an honest man

1178
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,647
Steak they've been things that he was wrong about

1179
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,695
Because the s*** he was saying wasn't based on

1180
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
Even as time went on and you needed to explain away into

1181
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,583
Consistency the new information

1182
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,423
Mainstream Media or the official narrative

1183
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,983
When the initial timeline began

1184
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
Fall Apart

1185
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,311
He had Tim Enloe his former Blackwater

1186
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
Security guard

1187
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:38,431
Come on the show and give out anonymously sourced information that helped Alex reframe things

1188
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
As a hostage

1189
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Situation

1190
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,551
CNN or even Fox news reporting that

1191
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
And then

1192
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,343
Alex covering

1193
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:51,999
That's not what the situation when he even said he had inside sources that were his

1194
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:55,583
Security guard gathering information from sources which Alex took

1195
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
And created his own story out of

1196
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:02,751
That's independent reporting.

1197
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:07,359
The mistakes Alex's made in this entire situation or his own fault largely speaker

1198
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:11,711
There are a few mistakes that he made that are ultimately completely forgiven

1199
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,271
Because there were two states that almost any reporter would make

1200
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,855
And I think it would Alex wants to pretend it is is that

1201
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
The same pass

1202
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,439
That actual

1203
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Aboveboard

1204
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
Reporters

1205
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,375
Explicitly from their deposition

1206
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,655
Since that they are nocturnal

1207
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
Well

1208
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,239
Depends on which deposition

1209
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
Second point

1210
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,335
Do good would ever come out of Alex going to Uvalde

1211
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,663
He wouldn't have sniffed out any truth or done any reporting

1212
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:48,319
Even in the prime of his career he wasn't capable of that and now when he goes anywhere

1213
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,879
Misreporting the video of him yelling

1214
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,671
To create the whatever story he wants

1215
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:57,023
Winston's remember when he went down to the border and got in front of an immigrant charity vehicle

1216
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:04,447
He captured literally nothing on camera but reported that he bravely put his body on the line to stop human trafficking

1217
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,519
When the video is mostly him complaining about seat belt laws

1218
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,311
That would be the best

1219
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,103
Case scenario him going to Uvalde

1220
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,919
Some kind of disrespectful and self-serving publicity

1221
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:21,087
Also nothing about the Buffalo shooting the shooter engaging with a retired federal agent indicates that there was provocative

1222
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,927
If anything it indicates that there's a retired federal agent who's a race

1223
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,767
That's not signs of provocate

1224
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791
Touring Alex

1225
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,839
But he's bringing that in

1226
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,631
And he's establishing that

1227
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
As a precedent

1228
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,191
And he can use

1229
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,239
To say that this was a false flag

1230
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,775
Follows almost

1231
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
An identical path to the Aurora shooting

1232
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Being used

1233
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
In advance of Sandy Hook

1234
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,919
Barry's AIDS

1235
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
Similar relationship here where Alex

1236
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
Can talk about

1237
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,527
Things that have

1238
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,343
To do with the Buffalo shooting and the provocateur

1239
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,415
And the audience is meant to imply it in their head there

1240
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
There's be direct

1241
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,975
Connection between drawing

1242
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
And as we know from

1243
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,071
Listening back to a lot of the Sandy Hook.

1244
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,887
There were periods of time where he was not comfortable

1245
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,911
Necessarily

1246
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:11,007
Directly talking about Sandy Hook because of the horror of it right

1247
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,591
Could be fake who knows we know the Aurora one today

1248
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
Feels

1249
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,663
Very similar

1250
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,223
Yeah it look it's a little bit like

1251
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,783
Like a like a placemat you know like

1252
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
These two pictures

1253
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,367
Find find the things that are different about them

1254
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:31,487
Like it is like he has two completely different pictures and he's like find the things that are the same about

1255
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,327
It's a completely different picture of a completely different person

1256
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,423
But if you see they've got an earring they both got earrings at the same

1257
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
But what if

1258
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
One of the picture

1259
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
It doesn't have an earring

1260
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Drawing

1261
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
A victory

1262
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,967
What if you just imagine there's an earring

1263
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,527
What if you yell at anybody tells you that there isn't any

1264
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,367
Well then you will be rich

1265
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,647
So I guess not because he's getting

1266
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,719
That he did that

1267
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:09,119
That may need 50. Say it a second time

1268
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
Smollett and Bubba Wallace

1269
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,519
But I still kind of just stayed out of it

1270
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,823
Because

1271
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
Situation

1272
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
We won't be liked

1273
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,967
Consciously

1274
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
Gulf of this

1275
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:32,671
Because it's who wants to be

1276
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:38,047
I'm not impressed that he would invalidate you know

1277
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,095
Accusations of racist

1278
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
Acts

1279
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,167
Not that it's not surprising that he would call

1280
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:49,055
Smollett fake and

1281
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
So he can

1282
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
Dunno claim that as a victory when did

1283
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
It's just his knee jerk

1284
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,735
There's some real mixed signals going on in that clip

1285
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
That's a man

1286
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,551
Who has a background report

1287
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,855
That nobody even knows where it came

1288
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:05,695
Came from like 100 something page-long

1289
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,975
Grieving

1290
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:11,071
His actions were influenced by the fact

1291
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,631
He's being sued for lying Button Elementary School shooting

1292
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:17,983
Everything he says after that make me think of his actions were deeply influenced

1293
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,823
By the factory being sued for lying about in elementary school shooting

1294
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,663
He says that he stayed out of it and then something like this happens

1295
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
Begin his actions will be

1296
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,015
Implies that there's something that was

1297
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:36,671
I'm not cover this situation the way he wanted to and I don't believe anything to do with grieving parents

1298
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,719
Conscious it was unconscious

1299
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,815
He's shown nothing but disrespect for grieving families

1300
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:51,007
Alex needs his audience to think that he's not been weakened by the Sandy Hook cases so he'll ultimately be as defense

1301
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,055
He needs to be about that issue on air

1302
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:57,919
He won't ever directly say that he didn't want to get sued again so he wasn't going to call the shooting fake

1303
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,735
Because to do so would to tell Abby to tell the audience

1304
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
He's not offense

1305
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,319
Is reporting based on personal

1306
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,927
Now you might be thinking that he already said that he didn't cover this correctly because he had faith in the

1307
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
The police in Texas

1308
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
Admitting the same thing

1309
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
But here's the difference

1310
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,583
And that case the reason he covered it wrong is

1311
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,119
Because he had a faith

1312
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
If things that the audience

1313
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
They love the cops and they think

1314
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
Texas should be its own country

1315
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,311
Conversely in the case of Alex changing his coverage

1316
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
Because of fear of lawsuits

1317
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,127
That's Alex being week

1318
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,967
And if you accept that you have to accept

1319
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,271
He might not cover all sorts of issues

1320
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:40,671
Might cover other stories knowingly in accurately because of some fear that he has about consequences that the system could

1321
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
How can I watch

1322
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,279
Possibly be a person is willing to die fighting the globalist

1323
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,583
If he's willing to fundamentally change his coverage

1324
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,375
Out of fear of losing some money

1325
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,167
I get it it's complete

1326
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Completely

1327
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,263
Knocks.out the underpinnings of his own fake personality

1328
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Cannot

1329
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,055
Admit that

1330
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,103
He will change his behavior for anything

1331
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,455
Yeah I mean hatab doesn't matter how bad it is it doesn't matter

1332
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
What it is

1333
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,527
He can't say that I have learned a lesson

1334
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,343
Because he's presented himself to his audience as

1335
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,927
Someone who can't learn lessons at all because they already know every

1336
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,975
He can't learn lessons

1337
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,511
Because he wasn't wrong

1338
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,071
Exactly

1339
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,351
Yeah and the end

1340
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,911
For him to then have to be wrong

1341
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
And Afraid

1342
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
I'm not going to follow that dude

1343
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
No

1344
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,359
So I think that obviously

1345
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:34,687
The way he covered the story out of a fear of getting

1346
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,711
Wingsuit again

1347
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
I hadn't

1348
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
Play obvious

1349
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,295
How to

1350
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,831
Play the things have gone with the

1351
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,415
Changing statements timeline shifting and what-have-you

1352
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
Brightness sweet spot

1353
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,839
You and I kind of has to figure out a way to

1354
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
I be like yeah

1355
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
I really should have

1356
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,495
LOL I dropped the police this is such a weird situation for him

1357
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,567
I do think the way that you sounded up was pretty good that like

1358
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,687
I tried to tell the truth I know it is that really is it is him being like

1359
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
Man

1360
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
This was the time

1361
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
For me to say it's a false flag

1362
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
Because legally they couldn't do s***

1363
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:17,183
The cops are lying so if you want to get on me you got to sue them acid

1364
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,767
You know like there's many ways of

1365
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,863
Something being fake that aren't legally actionable

1366
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,911
Totally could have done that totally

1367
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,471
Because of the circumstances that are surround

1368
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:35,103
Is The Gunshot this is that because he

1369
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,639
He didn't call it a false flag

1370
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,175
More people are going to stop

1371
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,991
Baby yeah maybe

1372
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,063
I think that what a coward

1373
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,599
So lucky

1374
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
If you drop the ball here

1375
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,975
We drop the ball we gave the police the benefit of the doubt because it's Texas

1376
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
The

1377
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
Head

1378
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,423
Police chief other school district

1379
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
Is in hiding

1380
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,495
To the city council

1381
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
He won't talk to the Press

1382
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,359
He won't talk to State Police for Texas Rangers

1383
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,895
He won't talk to the feds

1384
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,479
Who knows what app

1385
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,039
As it turns out there were police in there for an hour

1386
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,599
It turns out they weren't outside

1387
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,415
None of that was true

1388
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,975
So what the normal media did

1389
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,511
Was give the police the band

1390
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
That's not what Alex

1391
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:30,655
Also I have no idea what he saying that there were no police at the school

1392
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:38,079
It's not accurate at all creating a nude

1393
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:42,943
I've apologized for not calling in a false flag now I'm free to make up whatever bulshit I want

1394
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,735
Almost spitefully

1395
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:51,135
I'm looking at the comment section on this video cuz I was released this section as a standalone thing on

1396
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,487
Alex Jones admits he was wrong about Uvalde shooting

1397
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,815
Anti going through yet somebody

1398
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:03,423
I heard there are no birth records for those kids in Uvalde is that true

1399
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,775
There we go

1400
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
A lot of shoutouts

1401
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
Steve pieczenik

1402
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
Wow

1403
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,711
I guess Las Vegas is didn't happen I guess we're going to bring that back

1404
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:19,295
Oh my God is Steve pieczenik going to come back and talk about this

1405
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Maybe

1406
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,831
Wow

1407
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:26,463
Wow door seems open wide open now based on the comment section

1408
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,047
Alicia and I think you can even get a little bit of a temperature

1409
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,607
Nobody died that's another comment

1410
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Great

1411
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
Grab

1412
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,823
Yeah these are all people who would like finally he's going to claim with the false flag now

1413
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,407
Excitement I'm getting smarter than

1414
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,223
Right I hope that leads to some

1415
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
Non retention

1416
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Did you would hope

1417
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,855
So lucky what he's now

1418
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,647
Shifting things and now Alex

1419
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
Is blaming

1420
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
These police

1421
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
Good

1422
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,047
70 + minutes

1423
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,095
The police stand around

1424
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,887
Sitting on their hands

1425
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,263
Songs in the ranch

1426
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,407
Of the school district

1427
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,991
Shed so it turns out wasn't in radio communication

1428
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,111
Dereliction of Duty

1429
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
That is

1430
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
Serious

1431
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Ham

1432
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
In

1433
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:37,887
Languages

1434
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,823
We don't cheat the police

1435
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,431
Tell me what

1436
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,295
This is shameful

1437
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
And this is disgusting

1438
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:03,231
Strikes me that this is ultimately completely thin and false and I think they're two contributing factors

1439
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:08,607
For that one out exaggerate everything because he desperately wants to make his show more interest

1440
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:15,007
Time to Alex feel the need to exaggerate this situation so it makes his audience more able to criticize the police

1441
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:21,663
By using hyperbole Alex is able to distinguish his complaints about the situation from the complaints his audience might hear from Below

1442
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
For the main

1443
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,991
Stream media or people who are supposed to be globalist

1444
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:29,599
Cuz when they criticize the police response Alex wants to have something distinctive

1445
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,879
From them

1446
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,695
In order to to provide that above all

1447
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
I just

1448
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Despite

1449
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,559
The fact that right now

1450
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,887
We can all across ideological lines

1451
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
Agreed

1452
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
The cops

1453
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
I think we can all agree that there is

1454
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:52,127
Definitely very very strong indications of that there should be a thorough investigation of

1455
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
What happened

1456
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,431
But Alex still can't agree with

1457
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,223
It has to be something

1458
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
It needs to be more

1459
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:03,135
Extreme it needs to be above that and it needs to be a narrative of his own

1460
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,207
For instance Alex's with Commander wasn't even there

1461
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,231
Which isn't true

1462
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:11,327
Pete Arredondo was on the scene and he was one of the first inside the school

1463
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:17,471
He didn't have his radio with him but part of his explanation for that was that he didn't think that he was the commander on scene

1464
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
And it's not other agency was taking the lead

1465
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,591
And you were supposed to be there acting as a first responder

1466
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,663
Right now whether or not you believe that or not or think that's

1467
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
Appropriate or not

1468
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:31,295
That is an explanation that he is given for why you didn't have a radio and then Alex's just

1469
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,087
Completely wrong about him not BFF

1470
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,367
Yeah he's wrong about that

1471
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:39,231
They're very valid and productive arguments to make against the police response

1472
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,047
In theory lead to discussions about how to improve things

1473
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,375
But Alex's critiques are mostly surrounding fake issues

1474
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:50,239
If you're a listener they shown you here indignation about how the police chief wasn't even there

1475
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,567
You're going to be poorly prepared to have a conversation about this

1476
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
Whatever

1477
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,639
You're going to try to make about the police response

1478
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,687
Seriously

1479
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:03,295
If he wasn't even there was part of the If part of your list of grievances right

1480
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,879
People is like oh you don't you don't know you're talkin I mean that's that's

1481
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,159
Have a good one though

1482
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,183
Put in there early

1483
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
Because that'll

1484
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,511
Be real good when you climb with the false flag

1485
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:15,327
Like the guy who was telling people to stand down was

1486
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:20,191
Even there and said he was there obviously that's a false flag

1487
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Sure

1488
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
I mean it'll just be

1489
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:28,383
And I honestly want to say that I think the Thursday

1490
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,919
Very decent chance

1491
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,479
That Alex doesn't pursue this line

1492
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,759
Too much further

1493
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,855
Like I don't know if there's much of a market for him now in a

1494
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
Conspiracy theory

1495
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,159
But there is some

1496
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:43,231
And establishing a new narrative surrounding this

1497
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,535
So if something else happens down the road

1498
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,351
He can be on the Alex Jones side of this

1499
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,167
Supposed to be weird side but he's been on here

1500
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
Selectman

1501
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
There might be a chance

1502
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,359
This is shameful

1503
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,663
And this is disgusting

1504
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,735
Who the hell knows what happened

1505
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,295
Really suspicious

1506
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,951
Really suspicious of the whole thing in the timing and the midterms and all of its commitment with the feds

1507
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:22,399
White supremacist

1508
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:29,055
Yes you have to have this storyline about the Buffalo shooting

1509
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,871
Fades and is being covered up right timing

1510
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,407
The midterm midterms

1511
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:38,783
Yeah it says you're getting your getting all these pieces of the standard Infowars false flag

1512
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
Conspiracy

1513
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
Starting to

1514
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,855
To gravitate and circle around

1515
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,903
The story

1516
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
I mean

1517
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,975
Honestly it's just sad

1518
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
Cuz

1519
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
We all knew we were going to get here

1520
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:49,791
I know

1521
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
Do you mean you remember like ham

1522
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,607
Viewer

1523
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,631
You're confused

1524
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,655
For a second about Lake

1525
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,703
He wants to call this a false what

1526
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:03,103
Absolutely you could feel it in his words

1527
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,151
Could feel his shoulder start to shake when it like

1528
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:06,943
He tried to get it

1529
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,247
There's a very similar dynamic

1530
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
21 Lake

1531
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
Before Stefan molyneux

1532
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,855
Said that he was a white nationalist

1533
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,391
Like everybody like

1534
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,231
Please get to the point where you say it is as if they are white nationalists already

1535
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,839
Just come out with it

1536
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,119
This is a

1537
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,423
Maybe this is a false flag going on

1538
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,519
The timing the midterm don't make the Buffalo shooting the feds cover-up

1539
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,591
It's all there man you've come up with

1540
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Bulshit

1541
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,919
Connected those bullshits

1542
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
In order to

1543
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,991
Create the appearance of a conspiracy

1544
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
But the tax

1545
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,319
But he's putting into this board

1546
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
REO

1547
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,135
And the string is

1548
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:54,815
It's all done said yeah this is going to go down as one of the more surreal couple weeks of Infowars cover

1549
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,607
And their entire his

1550
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,167
Probably because they were trying to tell the truth

1551
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,263
I mean I think

1552
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:09,663
I agree with you but it's too generous to say tracks Healthcare

1553
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,943
They were trying to do

1554
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,967
A better

1555
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,271
Based on what we were described as

1556
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,295
Better

1557
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,623
Silent Alex is ashamed of himself

1558
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,159
But that's not all

1559
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
There's also

1560
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Estate

1561
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Nae

1562
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,303
A country that is a shame.

1563
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631
Luxembourg

1564
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
Concrete

1565
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,663
All we know it could be entailed

1566
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,735
What

1567
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,063
Just like the witmer

1568
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
Yeah

1569
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,975
So we're back to

1570
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,071
Dinner before Pizza Gates I got to I got to figure out what's going on with this stuff

1571
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,607
Sandy Hook

1572
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,631
Same thing

1573
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,167
Can I get to the bottom of this

1574
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,775
Nope but

1575
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,359
You can also see that is part of now the constellation

1576
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Do things

1577
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,407
But he's bringing in

1578
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:20,831
Talkin about the Uvalde shooting and he's bringing in these other things that are safe for him to say

1579
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
Parfait

1580
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,391
In order for him to

1581
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,463
Go to transpose the fakeness ought to the Uvalde shooting

1582
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,023
Until it's more safe for him to actually

1583
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,583
Fully say that

1584
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,631
Have to say this is fake

1585
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,911
I've established

1586
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
A career

1587
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,983
I'm saying things are fake so if I just

1588
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
Reply

1589
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
You got

1590
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,823
It's very transparent

1591
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,895
And it's Alex

1592
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
Get pretty mad

1593
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,503
The police followed the criminal orders of that

1594
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
Police chief

1595
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,807
I need to be a nag house right now

1596
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
Now

1597
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:06,655
14 minutes down proper 70

1598
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,471
Wow

1599
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:15,104
That strong words strong words from a man with a

1600
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
Vocabulary

1601
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
Again

1602
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
Yeah

1603
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,576
I don't know I feel like

1604
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,648
This is meant to be an apology correction

1605
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:31,232
Sure and what it ends up really being is

1606
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:37,888
I knew I was right about this and I did it's sad because of something but it's not the

1607
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
Lawsuit

1608
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,984
And you know who's really to blame the media and the police

1609
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,776
They did me dirty

1610
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,056
I'm always right

1611
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,872
Phil you can't apologize

1612
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,176
And be Vindicated

1613
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,712
That is not how that go

1614
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,296
It does on Infowars baby is true

1615
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
You're right

1616
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,160
I am apologizing because I was to write all the time

1617
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:04,512
I apologize for being self-aggrandizing right now but I won't

1618
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Very

1619
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Prairie

1620
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:11,168
The fascinating about this that is

1621
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
Yo

1622
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
On a certain level

1623
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,520
When Alex makes things up

1624
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,544
It's full of s***

1625
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,336
Irresponsible and dangerous

1626
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:23,200
I already tries to do what normal reporters might do

1627
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
He can't

1628
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
Eddie still f*****

1629
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,272
Yep

1630
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,576
How we end up here

1631
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,856
It's it's like

1632
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:34,464
It's like somebody was taking a baby step towards learning a lesson

1633
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
Okay

1634
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
I got it

1635
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,560
Sandy Hook

1636
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,352
Is going to f*** my brain out

1637
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
So guess what I'm going to do

1638
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,168
I'm going to button down

1639
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,216
I'm going to really try on this one

1640
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,776
And I know your your face says that no

1641
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:52,128
But I will look

1642
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,200
Is that the lesson isn't or it shouldn't be

1643
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,736
Is going to ruin me

1644
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
It should be

1645
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,576
What I did was wrong

1646
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,160
He learned the wrong listed played it and then

1647
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,464
Learned another wrong lesson which was

1648
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
I should have just been an ass

1649
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,864
I should have just been a slightly different kind of a****** cuz I have

1650
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:19,008
Trade my friend and now I have to explain why I didn't do the thing that everybody knew I was going to do eventually course

1651
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,288
Yeah

1652
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,312
That sucks

1653
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:25,152
Yep this is what happens when conspiracy theorists are brought low

1654
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
Yeah

1655
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:29,504
Yeah I mean

1656
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,832
Close to handling this s*** Shakespeare was a moron

1657
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,648
If you fix that meant anything it went out

1658
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:39,488
Accident in the f****** web very very sad

1659
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,024
Shameful

1660
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,840
So I think

1661
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,144
You know I am not

1662
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:51,264
I'm not sure it was as revelatory as some other things that I got mad at Florida

1663
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,640
That's right I got mad at Florida.

1664
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,712
I'm pissed off at Florida fire Florida

1665
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:06,880
Oh hell you back to Spain also the rest of the show is Alex interviewing

1666
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:10,464
The guy who's attacks weirdo

1667
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,560
Whatever

1668
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:18,144
Broker content

1669
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,984
I don't know if this is as educational

1670
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,032
Necessarily it some other things that we

1671
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:27,872
Focused and moron but I do think that there is

1672
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
Freddy

1673
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,944
Play a narc

1674
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,016
Since the

1675
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,296
The shooting

1676
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,344
And it did go diff

1677
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,720
Currently been a lot of times analysis career based on

1678
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:46,048
And you see that all roads lead to Rome

1679
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,840
In Rome is calling a stock

1680
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,448
Kind of depressing

1681
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,984
You know I mean

1682
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
This wasn't

1683
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:58,592
So much like the information heavy as it was almost a character

1684
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,872
Their study

1685
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,152
Is a slice of life

1686
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,200
Kind of what happens

1687
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,504
Whenever people stop

1688
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,528
You know

1689
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,064
Acting fake

1690
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:13,184
Start getting real who's real world Austin I'm pretty sure that's what that was a season either

1691
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,256
