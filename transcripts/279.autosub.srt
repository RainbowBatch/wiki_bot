1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
We're couple dudes like sit around with novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Jordans

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
Jordans

4
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:23,808
We are good wings

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,392
Grace of God and all of the

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,792
And supportive ARA are fine listeners weave

7
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Studio recording

8
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
In order to get this.

9
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,224
Everybody out there

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
I was considering it if you don't if you run out of friends with cars and truck great option

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,208
It seems like your heart

12
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
I recommend

13
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
Wonder. They had more employees

14
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Into guys

15
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Nothing is a lie

16
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Wild time for us to take off every time

17
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Nothing ever happens one time

18
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Like a Christmas

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:54,944
I don't even think that nothing important happened at all during the time that we're off

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
Every Kevin episode no no news happens

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
Out of the public sphere

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
There is a lot of stuff that probably in our best interest

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
To leave alone and ignore a lot of these things out of

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
Suicides of survivors of mass shootings

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,296
Coming to cover it anyway

26
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
I'm in some stuff is just kind of like I wish we could have covered it but who cares like chicken restaurant

27
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,584
Acting like assholes

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
All those things are really is Alex hijacking people's

29
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
Social media Presence by going into the spaces that they're in

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
And forcing them to make videos of him that is free promotion

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
And all that their social media

32
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Barrel through any other Sensational propaganda

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
Admission to everybody

34
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,240
Develops into other things

35
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,056
We have one

36
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
That has happened in this time

37
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,712
That we've been away there we must cover

38
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:38,112
You know what I'm getting different reports for different sources on that I am not entirely sure

39
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
Don't want to judge him too much because I've moved into the pictures yet

40
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Glass houses stones

41
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,264
It's a real shame

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
I'm going to have to get dentures

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
Becoming a medical truther

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
What we have to talk about today Jordan is that was forced to sit down and give a three-hour deposition

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
In his Sandy Hook defamation lawsuit

46
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839
And some

47
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
The media largely speaking is getting a number of the wrong messages

48
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,687
As we go along

49
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
It would be great and I would enjoy to get back to business giving a shout-out a couple of

50
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
New governor supporting a shout

51
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Ewok

52
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,287
I'm a policy wonk

53
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,175
I'm a policy wonk thank you so much

54
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
I'm a policy wonk

55
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,695
Perhaps

56
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
Special with the move there was so many

57
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
Unexpected things that popped up in terms of household expenses

58
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
And out of nowhere this person came through and die

59
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
I must say Keith asked the Third

60
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
You are now a raptor princess

61
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
Start until you're brilliant someone sodomites

62
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
Has a Korean

63
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,543
I don't want Jesus Christ

64
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
Find know how to read

65
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,927
Abused

66
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,535
Joseph Stalin

67
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
Sound level you can only imagine

68
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:50,623
Sports

69
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,023
We appreciate it please

70
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
For this for so long

71
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,775
Losing my mind

72
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,271
That's

73
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
First

74
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,791
Okay okay I will

75
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
Alright buddy

76
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
You keep up

77
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
I'm so here's where we're going to start remember

78
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
Clip his first clip that were starting

79
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,175
It applies to everything that we here

80
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
For the rest of this episode

81
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
Do solemnly swear that the testimony about table

82
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,583
He is sworn in this is this is all in this is all legally actionable from here on out

83
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
The interesting thing

84
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:11,263
Forget going there's an important point I need to make about what we're going to listen to and the fact that Alex is sworn in

85
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
This is the deposition that Alex is being made to sit in a question about regarding his

86
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
Is very important

87
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,391
Although we just heard him be sworn in the beginning of the episode

88
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,487
Perjury is a very different thing in civil cases Ben it isn't criminal cases

89
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
In civil cases there's no formal penalty for lying in a deposition which Alex absolutely does multiple times

90
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
3 hour session that he sits for

91
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,103
Punishment for perjury in a civil case would require winning the case and then after the fact have your lawyer filed Criminal

92
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Charges for the perjury charge

93
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,479
The best of prosecution could really help for within this case

94
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
Is the demonstrated for outright to show evidence

95
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Cross-examination

96
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,767
Even then the only consequence would be the court view Hangouts as an unreliable Witness

97
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
Which would be the result of him just answering any questions without being a

98
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Play

99
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Alex knows best

100
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
His lawyers know that

101
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
So they really know that there's no real Stakes here

102
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,407
The only benefit of something like this comes from the public seeing it

103
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,247
Which is why I'm very glad that this deposition got posted online by the law firm

104
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
There's a great deal of value for our purposes

105
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
MC Hammer and try to pretend he knows anything about what he's talking about but ultimately

106
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Gold value

107
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
In this I suspect

108
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,863
Again I'm not a lawyer but from everything I've been able to tell

109
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
This civil consequences for perjury are not

110
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
That very real

111
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
America's Civil Justice as somebody who is recently

112
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
Real person

113
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
Lawyer questions and stuff like that

114
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:14,911
VIP no lawyers don't have any ideas about that

115
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
The idea that this is like a huge blind spot of the legal system

116
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
It's okay it's kind of knows that he doesn't have to give a f*** you can sleep walk through this

117
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,551
Or anything like that

118
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
It would require so much

119
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,767
I think you could in the actual trial but not in the deposition

120
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Who cares

121
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,655
I need to give a little bit of a shake of the finger also

122
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Do the general need it

123
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,495
Media as I alluded to a minute ago

124
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
For The Listener to use actually shaking his

125
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Finger wag

126
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
In the wake of this deposition being posted I saw a large number of headlines are being circulated that had to do without

127
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,087
Conspiracies

128
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:10,207
And it's recording the story

129
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,095
Alex does use the word psychosis in a conversation about his journey as a conspiracy theorist

130
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
But if you listen to the context

131
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,239
It's very clear that you speaking metaphorically and Loosely about his mind state

132
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
Visa Vie his distrust of media sources

133
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
The entire quote-unquote

134
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,247
Psychosis narrative boils down to this we're about to hear which is a little over like a minute-long

135
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:38,879
Literally the last few minutes of the three-hour deposition

136
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,719
So here is what everybody is making headlines out of

137
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
And I would argue that that is a great disservice first of all

138
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,471
To the other stuff that's in this and the fact that they're kind of playing fast and loose and it just

139
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Helps him

140
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
People lost

141
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
Remind myself

142
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,231
So obviously I think it's as a pundit

143
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
That you're my opinion Champion long

144
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Nothing whatever wrong consciously hurt

145
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Process

146
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Grow up

147
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:30,847
Rockwall Texas watching the police steal drugs and then conduct anti-drug program school I think that shouldn't

148
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
The police in general

149
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:37,247
And I was very fortunate to like Roper more things

150
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Krishna process

151
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
I'm just saying that the trauma

152
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
The corporation's lying so much

153
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
Send everything again

154
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,847
I like a child his parents watch him over and over again will pretty soon I don't know what

155
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,199
So what's up long before these lawsuits I said that

156
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
I thought everything was it

157
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Conspiracy

158
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
That mask

159
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,159
Opportunities

160
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
That's right

161
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Hawaiian

162
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
But at the same time is the most sensible thing

163
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,287
Listen to so much Alex

164
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
Says make sense to me because I'm like audit like I have no

165
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
Because of use the word psychosis so that everybody all the headlines are

166
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Psychosis

167
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
You listen to what you say

168
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
Pattern of behavior that got into where

169
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
I think

170
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
As I got older and I started more I realized

171
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,575
Default position is not a good way to operate

172
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,975
Now he's lying about absolute perception is not

173
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,095
That's not descriptive of like a mental psychosis or anything like that it's it's

174
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
Because you right

175
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
Finally admitting that he's crazy

176
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
But that was actually a lucid statement very much so looking back on it

177
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,087
Arrow

178
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,671
And we spoke very

179
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,791
Irresponsible suspicions that Alex had something going on with him on a neurological level

180
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:07,007
I just to see now to operate for so long and know that reporting that snippet of his conversation as quote Alex

181
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
Is literally playing into Alex's hand and serves to validate his narratives about media persecution against them

182
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
I'm pretty disappointed that coverage

183
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,623
Especially considering there's a whole lot of stuff in here that would have made great headline

184
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
You could even make quick fade out of it

185
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,815
Imma probably going to try throughout this to make quick pay

186
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Amen to this proceeding

187
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
Now let's get down to it

188
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,983
In a linear fashion because it comes from the m

189
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
Of the things

190
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,223
More could be the media watch the first 5 minutes

191
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
And then skipped

192
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,927
Possible absolutely no judgment

193
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
Mark Richards he's on YouTube now will be coming soon

194
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,823
The prosecutor did a very admirable job

195
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,687
He did the best he could but ultimately in situation like this there isn't really a win

196
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
But he comes as close as anyone can

197
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
And I do admire that on some level.

198
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
And then Alex

199
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,487
That does his first big lie of the deposition

200
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,679
Claim that I started controversy

201
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
This is not

202
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
I read that correctly

203
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
Finessin it says before I ever publicly commented

204
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,383
On any issues relating to Sandy Hook

205
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
I learned that others were

206
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
Do I have no affiliation

207
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
Or relationship

208
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
Had already posted articles

209
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,719
Relationship had already posted articles online

210
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Questioning

211
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,887
So there were a variety of articles in YouTube videos

212
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,191
Questioning

213
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,847
How long is it to ritacca

214
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
I don't know I don't answer incorrectly

215
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Longer

216
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
Yeah

217
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
Is Alex

218
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
A couple days

219
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
He was out there on his show

220
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
That sort of thing so

221
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:09,279
All these all these YouTube videos

222
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:15,935
But that's his way of trying to dodge responsibility

223
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,663
About that idea to get to this kind of idea

224
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,807
And actually I think from are looking back on it perceptions of what is accurate

225
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,927
Pictures of Interest there's a base

226
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,535
Of accuracy and what he's about to say about what he did after Sandy Hook

227
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
He's just forgotten the other stuff

228
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
But he has to say

229
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
Sandy Hook

230
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Media

231
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,711
Hakufu shootings Wisconsin cop

232
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
Psychic vampires

233
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Body mass shootings

234
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Shut the first episode

235
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
7 years ago

236
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,471
Springleaf

237
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
Firestorm internet's like no

238
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
This is a Prozac

239
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
This isn't video games like I was saying I thought like others

240
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
This was

241
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
Some type of

242
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Series

243
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
So the part that's realism focus on

244
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
So there's like 15 minutes

245
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,447
Narrative towards that

246
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,407
I could see how he could look back on that.

247
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,223
I was mostly just talkin about gunship

248
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Brett

249
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,623
It's an interesting like it's an interesting line cuz I can't

250
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,439
But it is ludicrous to say like

251
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,815
I didn't also do the other stuff

252
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,655
Supposed

253
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
Like view his memory

254
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
How things go

255
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
Is that that's what he thinks actually happened

256
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Because he doesn't

257
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,407
Remember or understand the parts of himself

258
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,479
They just pop out and then pop it just like

259
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,719
Oh that the whole thing was

260
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,375
That's why they come after the little aside part I think there's a good chance of that

261
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
I think they could explain most of his perception

262
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,871
How not to say perhaps

263
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
A good theory is Alex's defense

264
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,184
Let me know.

265
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,816
Throughout this entire proceeding deposition

266
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:28,192
Mr. Barnes and mr. Enoch Robert Barnes

267
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:37,408
Don't know they're two different barns

268
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,040
Alex in the deposition

269
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,600
Yeah he does a lot

270
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,672
But Mr Enoch is there and he's not supposed to talk

271
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
Because it's not a to lawyer deposition and he keeps talking and that becomes a big problem

272
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
Because he's trying to lead Alex

273
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
He's trying to like

274
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
Say things

275
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,944
Tennis player violations

276
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,576
How to Stonewall a little bit

277
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
But what is the defense that's being presented at the beginnings of it

278
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
In this clip right here

279
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,096
Mr. Jones this is a video mate,

280
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Issues relating

281
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
And

282
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Correct

283
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Rewadix

284
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,560
If you wants to go Washington tire for our video

285
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,936
Connecticut

286
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Argue about that

287
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,952
WrestleMania matters edited

288
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
I like this guy he's not

289
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:40,032
For real good lines throughout the course of this there was

290
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,736
Who's making that objection so it still appropriate within the content

291
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,112
But it's to the groundwork in establishing setup

292
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
These tapes are edited

293
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:02,048
Clear because his voice wasn't I couldn't hear Barnes voice terribly

294
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:09,984
Show the entire tape because you're showing is an edited down version right

295
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,312
Their defense is that if you watch the entire tape

296
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
It's going to exonerate

297
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
Text Alex

298
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
That nobody is going to watch the entire so either in the court everybody watches

299
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
Is the entire episode

300
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
He's going to claim that whatever do as you said you missed you could watch 3 hours and 59 minutes

301
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:42,752
But if you don't

302
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:49,152
Uno's that they are f*****

303
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
Contacts

304
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
Is that come up over and over and over again this idea of falling back on the idea that the tape is edited

305
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,560
In a little bit

306
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,960
The prosecutor was the first person

307
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
To call Sandy Hook a false flag

308
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,360
And then Alex pulled out his normal

309
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
You are the first person

310
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
To make about Sandy Hook

311
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
That's the truth

312
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Text Tucker

313
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
We know that to be true

314
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Yeah that's

315
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,800
Mr. Jones you said in your affidavit before you commented on it

316
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Issues

317
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
Relating to Sandy Hook

318
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
You saw other things that other

319
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
That affidavit have

320
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
So we didn't just see you commented

321
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,184
That was callers calling

322
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,256
Totally had a bad day

323
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,520
There's no way to proceed forward cuz you can't

324
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,384
Rational reasonable world for everybody

325
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,552
And so yeah you're you're screwed

326
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,464
I will play every goddamn

327
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
We're going to have a year-long trial

328
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
Let's move on everybody

329
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
I might be unfair

330
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:59,456
The editing Clips together we heard earlier Alex

331
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
Quit

332
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,344
Media Matters made the derivatives together and and put out that clip

333
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
When is next clip

334
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
The prosecutor explained

335
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,744
Video Alex is a little bit like

336
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
Mr. Jones

337
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
That video you just saw

338
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Are you talking

339
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Were you talking about

340
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
Headed those pieces together

341
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Was that you on the

342
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:36,064
Show me the video that for

343
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
4 hours

344
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
You going to do that for me

345
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
So in that video

346
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Yes or no

347
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
You were commenting about

348
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
Videos

349
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:16,000
30 second clips

350
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:22,400
Well it kind of throws them off a little bit because you can't blame Media Matters not just like I did that I added of the videos

351
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
Exact problem position window

352

Series of Bop videos

359
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:07,968
Got him so bad so I can complain about it

360
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:14,624
Is the idea that when Bill Clinton was being grilled by his sexual impropriety

361
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,024
What's your definition of

What is stage

370
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:54,560
What is stage

371
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
That's good

372
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,496
Keeping way too much of this in the lawyer is like

373
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,848
I don't care what it says

374
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
Answered your question I'm talking about what

375
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:15,040
You said

376
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,136
It's a it's an insane situation

377
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
So there's a clip

378
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,256
Prosecutor plays where Alex says it's

379
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,656
He has a different critique which is just

380
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,472
Richard Jones I'm going to show you a clip from

381
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:38,336
April 13th Laura

382
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Videoray

383
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
Yes that's me on the video

384
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Understand

385
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,704
Starplex

386
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
Dismissive this lawyer is of Alex

387
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
Is this field of like

388
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:18,528
Dude you are not my first you like yourself

389
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,928
I've been doing this for a long time you idiot interesting dynamic

390
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
I was the same stuff that I was talking about

391
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,400
Who is a couple of points

392
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,800
And I think he has two angles of attack that will get to

393
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:47,456
Are there really good approaches to demonstrate about Alex

394
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,528
About what you said about Sandy Hook you can prove that case on the merits

395
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,880
He played a literal clipped him for that

396
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:00,000
But will you can use him as a tool for our other things that are also important

397
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:11,520
So in this next clip the prosecuting attorney plays

398
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
Literally didn't happen

399
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,408
You know that's great

400
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736
From December 29th

401
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
2014

402
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Garden Plain up for me

403
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
Search Usain

404
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
Research

405
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
I know exactly what

406
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Assertive

407
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
You do not need to be making suggestive objections about the cons

408
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
These are videos are highly

409
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Oyster Bar

410
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
That's a great opinion

411
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,312
I don't understand why your opinion is irrelevant

412
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
?

413
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,024
Let's talk

414
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Aldo

415
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,032
All-in-one record every objection to every piece of evidence

416
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Zircon

417
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Which

418
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640
I was a dick

419
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,808
So they're going to stenographer comes in as I hate

420
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:06,208
You guys are making it really hard to type up

421
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
Sweet children

422
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,864
You know what it's an interesting dynamic because after she says that they are like all right let's get back on track

423
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Text the first time

424
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,664
Shut up shut up

425
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,832
It's obvious that you're talkin objections are trying to leave Alex down the road that you wanted to go down

426
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,904
And that's not appropriate positions going

427
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:41,792
And it is how it's going. Supposed to be supposed to be able to

428
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,376
Right right

429
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:53,568
This is one of the first instances where prosecutor

430
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,664
Did ideas about the specific narrative that Alex pushed

431
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,064
And one of them is the idea that Alex is talking about how they the teachers and the police had the kids

432
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
Walking in circles at the school

433
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,208
And there's a fundamental problem with a narrative that Alex is pushing

434
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,304
Spelled out in this clip and we'll discuss it on the other end

435
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
No. This is dangerous

436
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
Is it dangerous when there's somebody shooting up

437
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Yes

438
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
And so you would think

439
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
If

440
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Proper procedure

441
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
Just look pretty weird doesn't it

442
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,112
But mr. Jones

443
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
You knew that wasn't School

444
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
You knew that

445
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Right

446
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,656
Yes

447
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
First of all

448
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
First of all

449
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
And you've already chosen no mystery in October

450
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
And so I would appreciate it

451
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
Deposition

452
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Let mr. Barn

453
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Spoiler alert

454
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
That does not

455
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
Is a large

456
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
This was broadcast

457
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,776
So mr. Jones Mike West

458
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Broadcast

459
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
You knew

460
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Question

461
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Skip this

462
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Video of the

463
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
Mystery Duck we just watched it

464
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,888
Do you really think I edited his word over.

465
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Appreciate if you kept quiet

466
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
You knew that one

467
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
Looks like two different shows together

468
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,696
Who is eclipse

469
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
From different episode

470
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
And the third clip involved

471
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:26,400
Footage from the firehouse people walking around

472
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
And Alex is saying that it's the school

473
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,592
It appears the Enoch is trying to clarify is

474
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,944
Is the video in the audio from the same episode

475
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
It absolutely

476
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,320
But in this next clip

477
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:50,720
He tries to take that little colonel

478
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
Prosecution

479
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
And if it's pretty f***** up

480
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,120
Megyn Kelly

481
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Right

482
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
No mr. Bean

483
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
The witness

484
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
Deposition

485
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Wear these all

486
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:33,984
And we we said that repeatedly

487
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,384
Your indignation

488
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,456
You are

489
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
Actually I got a question

490
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
So

491
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:57,280
Do you know that this is like listening to a this is an exasperated man

492
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Just who's like

493
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:03,424
He knows what he's doing this is his job he's a professional this is what he does

494
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,776
And he is deposing a f****** live

495
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:14,176
Who has to a Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum for lawyers right

496
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
Is prosecutor

497
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,272
Sounds to me like he's looking at these guys talking is like

498
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,112
Prudential real quick

499
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
I'm guessing that he's probably dealt with them in the past he has some sort of like awareness

500
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:33,120
These guys aren't on the up-and-up

501
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
Some shady Tendencies and they're coming out here

502
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,776
Because

503
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
There is no point when they try to represent the idea that all of those clips came from the same episode

504
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
Absolutely not what they were

505
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
That's not what they're suggesting at all and they were very clear about that

506
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,328
You know your desperation

507
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,656
Give Alex some sort of cover to make similar arguments

508
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:13,056
As the deposition goes on

509
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,336
For the things that you were saying

510
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:20,736
Because these aren't things

511
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
Yep and so that's a problem

512
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
So now to the Firehouse issue

513
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
The reasoning that last clip it is a problem that Alex

514
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
It's saying that this is the school

515
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,816
Representing to his audience that it's the school

516
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,144
Is it in this next clip the prosecution

517
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
Rire evidence

518
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:47,616
The point his audience but it was the school

519
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
He had to have known it wasn't

520
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Contacts

521
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
On the road

522
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
You're later

523
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,792
You showed your audience video

524
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
I talked for hours a day

525
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,424
I can't ever want to talk about sometimes a week ago

526
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,288
Can you go Kiss band in the aggregate less than one-tenth of 1% of what I cover

527
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
And

528
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,920
Smnm pouring over constantly

529
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
Preparation

530
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,576
Barry give me a headache

531
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
I just

532
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,928
What question are you answering

533
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,304
You're asking me about a bunch of how does someone answer

534
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
?

535
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,472
Put a bunch of pages

536
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
I can't answer you a question

537
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
Edwards

538
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
I'm asking you

539
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
The school

540
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
No that's not what I do

541
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,575
Okay alright

542
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
Defense lawyers when out-of-town

543
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,263
Go to the building learn his name lest he become a hero of some sort

544
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,663
I want to resist that Beto impulse or whatever

545
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,247
So he's not at all

546
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,831
Prosecutor

547
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
I would assume so I can comment

548
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
Little bit more about that firehouse video and how Alex was reporting on it as they're being

549
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
Around in a circle with their hands up

550
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
So

551
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,359
The prosecution plays video files leave the firehouse from a helicopter

552
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
Yeah the damning question to ask Alex

553
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Let's

554
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
14th

555
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
2012 helicopter

556
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
Firehouse Subs

557
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,215
Elementary-age children

558
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,383
A talking about

559
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,943
None of those people have their hands up do they

560
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,807
Lassie the show sad Soldier complaining

561
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,903
Really cuz you were talking about it

562
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:46,559
Children

563
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,399
The people in there just throwing stuff up

564
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,983
Nicely done

565
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,871
I'm not sure about what

566
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,431
I was wrongly upset in the past

567
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,527
News reports that was relying on children

568
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
Going around with their hands up

569
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,183
The firehouse

570
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
Change my mind

571
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:24,191
Absolutely not true at all

572
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:28,799
Based on this

573
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
I love that is the

574
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,063
It was alive broadcast

575
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,135
And that the producers just play stopping any response to it

576
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:49,279
Okay no no no no.

577
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
It was a live broadcast

578
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:02,079
What's happening

579
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Franklin

580
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:16,159
I would do that he looks pretty bad I think in terms of this

581
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:22,559
Anomaly

582
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
LOL almost immediate

583
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
Now there's another narrative and that is the idea that it's the story that the school

584
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Who was closed

585
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:45,343
It was it was a dilapidated school there was mold everywhere

586
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,415
Conspiracy theories about this

587
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:56,351
That school has been dead for 15 years

588
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:02,751
Yeah that one was one of the ones that was like wow you guys are swinging for the fences with this

589
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,079
Very demonstrable

590
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:11,967
So the prosecution asked about that and his response is really interesting to me

591
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
I want to show you

592
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
17

593
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:43,455
First thing you admit now there are no emails between

594
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,183
This is almost 7 years old but I do believe that we wouldn't

595
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,791
There's always some news recovering

596
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,631
Or witness or doors or something so I can't answer that

597
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,167
Because I'm just memory

598
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
Troubadour

599
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
You just stuck

600
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
22nd

601
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
27

602
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,151
Hoops

603
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
You were saying that

604
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:34,399
So he goes on to email

605
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:40,799
Alondra show a video of the school after the shooting

606
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:47,199
Had to cut out that were there a redacted cuz it's like people blood all over the walls and stuff it shows in Normal

607
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:52,063
You noticed any any Elementary School

608
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,439
Does this look like a school that was shut down does this look like a school that is

609
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Condemned

610
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,583
He's a bit look like it's a different pair

611
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:16,383
Brought up that Alex did push and he can't the scrutiny

612
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
Consistently on either

613
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
You know what you know it's someone else's fault or this video is out of context I can't comment on my post

614
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,159
Once that's not good enough

615
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,047
And yet remains is that first one the idea that it's someone else's fault

616
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
Once that is your only remaining

617
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
Avenue of self-defense

618
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
You're going to get pushed on it

619
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,007
And eventually you're going to have to discuss

620
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:49,407
Where did you get that information from

621
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:56,063
I thought was going to be he was going to

622
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,695
Just turns and points directly he was right there

623
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,303
Be straight up and upfront about it

624
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
You didn't know one way or the other

625
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:14,751
Right whether the school is open

626
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Expert

627
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,247
We're the ones that professors and others that we're good standing

628
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,039
For the ones that we're really doing

629
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,087
These investigations and then I was

630
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,159
Some patients taking what they said

631
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,535
You just take what they said we trust

632
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
4

633
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,727
Has the national Safety expert

634
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Incredible

635
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
Mr. Hobbit right

636
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Can you send

637
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Something in the neighborhood

638
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
Ocelot

639
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
You wouldn't agree with me the top manager

640
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,231
She seems very credible and put together earlier on

641
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,559
Educated about 4 years ago

642
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
Defamation that's a fair assessment there's a really interesting trends

643
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:29,759
Beware the prosecutor seems to be trying to get Alex to admit that Wolfgang halbig is crazy

644
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:36,159
Buyer admire the gumption

645
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
For the prosecutor he's like

646
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,999
Alright I'm going to do this deposition first

647
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
But you guys got to give me five bucks

648
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,703
If I get him to say that this guy is f****** crazy he gets him as far as cookie I think

649
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:53,567
Ebony set a lot of email

650
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
So I think that's that's going to set the stage for a lot of the rest of Alex's defense to come there

651
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:06,367
You still be a lot of videos

652
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:10,975
I should have not listened to him is even too far for it to go but it's kind of like it was him

653
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:15,839
That's it

654
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,703
So now we get into this next clip the first angle that I think

655
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
Is

656
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,031
The good attack on Alex

657
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:28,127
I admire this about this that the prosecutor and his approach

658
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:33,247
And that is to demonstrate that Alex has no idea what he's talking about

659
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,599
Because if you can do that idea that he knows anything

660
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,903
Yeah it doesn't have to be about Sandy Hook

661
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,279
To your full advantage

662
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
One thing to do with these narratives that he can just say like

663
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
Forwarded it

664
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,495
It's much more robots

665
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,799
When you bring an effusive information

666
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,847
That you should know about

667
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
And he doesn't

668
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,479
And in this first clip prosecutor talks about First Responders

669
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
The school

670
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,319
And Alex is

671
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
Put on his heels a little bit

672
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,183
Michigan's probably went on a break we were talking about the issue

673
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
Couple copies

674
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
I put in

675
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
Second one

676
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:41,599
Another FEMA visit Alex has a really slow reader read most of it I didn't get two number two

677
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,159
How many how many they were on break

678
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:48,255
They could have just kept going for him to read I think he said I'm.

679
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:54,655
There's a couple other times where you try to have him read while the camera is still on

680
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,847
2

681
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,991
But after 3

682
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Yes I'm going to read that

683
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,903
Don't use your finger are you saying to is 5

684
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
At first glance

685
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
Bathroom

686
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,847
Sergeant Carlos skating

687
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
Maybe a paramedic

688
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
I agree

689
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,463
How to check for lice

690
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
The victim

691
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Redacted

692
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
Florida

693
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
The back corner

694
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
I thought she

695
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,575
I started karaoke

696
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,975
You've never heard a start

697
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Week

698
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
He didn't know what he did

699
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
Correct

700
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,647
It's again over 7 years I don't remember love this

701
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Hibachi

702
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
2017

703
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Paramedics

704
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:31,071
What GMT is related to the building

705
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,191
Winning

706
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
That approach is really good

707
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:43,359
Because what it does is it demonstrates a piece of information that was available as of

708
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:48,735
Sometime in 2013 when Alex

709
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:55,135
Possibilities

710
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:59,231
Realities for us

711
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:02,815
If he did know about it that he intentionally lied about it

712
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,655
If you didn't know about it then it's clear that he didn't look into anything

713
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:13,055
Exact position that sort of choice about how he

714
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,847
Represent what he does

715
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:19,199
You can't make that choice

716
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:25,855
I think so

717
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,183
I'm just saying his lawyers

718
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
Instead of doing the same thing cuz that's not going to do any good

719
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
Maybe

720
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,751
Some kind of hero

721
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:49,151
Whatever whatever that circle is Alex

722
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,711
Right whatever

723
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:58,111
Yeah whatever opposite of telling him to round third cut off cut off

724
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:05,279
That's the first instance of this next clip

725
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,839
Alex's reporting about the idea

726
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
Hobbs Act

727
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,191
The birth certificates and death certificates

728
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:16,031
Or put under strict access to them

729
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:20,127
And this this again is another instance of

730
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,663
The other really good approach

731
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,527
That is Infowars process

732
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,599
Because that's something that seems like wow

733
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:33,439
How did you get to the things you report it

734
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:39,839
By illustrating diligent at all

735
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Very good attack

736
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:45,471
The two attacks of you don't know what you're talkin about and you never check anything

737
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,031
Are very very Salient points

738
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,823
And I admire that being the approach

739
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:56,479
The first one which is you don't know what you're talkin about and it makes life we here

740
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
Anything you didn't do the basic

741
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:04,415
Steps you would need to report something

742
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:10,047
Can owner play eclipse of the moon mr. juice

743
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
February 12th 2015

744
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,375
November 8th

745
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:44,863
Highly edited

746
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,935
Send the context of

747
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,263
What did you do to confirm it

748
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Objective

749
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
You don't have to speak

750
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:14,047
I like there's a little there's a little more of this clip but I really love that you can make all the

751
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,631
Fair enough

752
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,775
The fact they were sealed

753
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,799
How did you confirm that

754
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
I don't want to

755
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,711
Answer these things incorrectly so my memory

756
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
I remember

757
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:39,135
Steelcase ever and that was in the news that they're always lawsuit

758
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
And that

759
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,231
The records and reports

760
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,279
Blacked out

761
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,655
That's so I can't accurately answer off of edited

762
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,623
News reports of other people that were investigated

763
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
Ourselves

764
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Sandy Hook

765
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:22,399
Thank you mr. Jones is an indication of I just got exactly what I wanted

766
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:28,799
Report on this

767
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:35,711
You're presenting as if you were reporting on nothing

768
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,831
He didn't answer that question

769
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:47,231
I think the long pause is the

770
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
About ordering death certificates or he's never done it tells me

771
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,423
Definitely

772
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
So if

773
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:02,079
Not knowing about the accounts of the First Responders is a great illustration of showing that Alex doesn't know s***

774
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,151
Write this next instance of it is

775
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
Beyond The Pale

776
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,479
This is something that I

777
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
Flavors are at Baskin-Robbins

778
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:17,951
I actually might not be able to answer that long time

779
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,535
No this is Elementary information

780
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,351
The idea that Alex is confused about this

781
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
He's really troubling

782
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,727
Bridget Jones I'm going to hand you a copy of what I have Mark

783
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,503
I don't remember

784
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,903
The timestamp 12 14 12

785
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
Don't know.

786
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
It is

787
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,311
That's real bad the feel this prosecutor get a little cocky

788
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:11,711
Feel him get a little get a little bit of

789
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,247
You might be a little more concerned

790
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:19,647
Cuz I don't think

791
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:27,839
Absolutely has no idea what it is

792
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:34,239
It would behoove you to know what date you're being strategic position it seems like the right thing to do

793
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,775
How do you reset yourself

794
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:41,151
Jethro

795
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:47,551
It was in the context of another narrative that I was his foot out that line of questioning

796
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:53,951
He was talking about that the prosecution was talking about had to do with Alex's story that you would tell about there

797
01:02:54,207 --> 01:03:00,351
Being delivered immediately which is

798
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,399
Ready to go squirrel this

799
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,191
So in this next clip

800
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
The prosecutor lays out

801
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,543
When forethought is actually showed up

802
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,335
Doing so

803
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,431
I think he accidentally reveals that Alex doesn't know what date

804
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,271
The shooting happened on and he doesn't know what time of day it happened on

805
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,575
I don't think he knows anything about this

806
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,391
Car sitting at the front

807
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
I would imagine

808
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,799
Because if

809
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
Porta-Potty showing up

810
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
That's what the time is right there

811
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,903
130 right

812
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,463
That's not an hour

813
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,863
Pretty darn soon after

814
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Is it

815
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Is it maybe more like

816
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,191
4 hours

817
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,263
And I was going off of

818
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:17,919
What I believe was credited National School Safety person who been on national television programs as an expert

819
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,455
What's going on

820
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,759
No confirmation

821
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
Whatsoever

822
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
Of Mr Talbot statements about the

823
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,903
I don't believe these videos were released for a long time

824
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
If they were

825
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,487
Get those videos were released

826
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,511
In 2030

827
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,303
Certainly

828
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
Potato porta potties

829
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,775
I just don't know how to respond

830
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:56,063
Yeah you are more

831
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,879
One still out something and tell me what

832
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
Coupon buddy

833
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
I guess correct

834
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:32,159
Underlying message

835
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,511
If this video was I'm 2013.nba responsible to do what you did

836
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:42,911
You know what that means that means this video was out in 2013 because he doesn't bring

837
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,959
That piece of information

838
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,775
You can just get these these pieces

839
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:54,175
Cross-examination is the actual trial if it needs to come up

840
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:00,063
It serves no purpose to bring it up here maybe Alex's

841
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,415
Best defense the fact that he knows absolutely nothing

842
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,511
No I don't think so cuz neck

843
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,911
I don't know because you can't knowingly doing it

844
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,727
It's kind of clear from the deposition that

845
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,615
Either Alex has an incredible liar a debate which is a guy who just

846
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,175
Says nonsense out of his mouth as it cops

847
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
I think

848
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:33,343
I think that the standard is knowing at the time of

849
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,743
You're saying that the time of saying it important

850
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:52,543
Is the school

851
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,591
The false statement

852
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,919
There is at least implied there

853
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:04,319
So whatever Alex doesn't know now it's kind of a material doesn't give a s***

854
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:09,951
Which is even more upsetting on some level

855
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
About with the stuff that being discussed is

856
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:17,631
Jarring knows that he can save these

857
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:23,007
Eagan fall back on that to some extent and then when he needs to just blame Wolfgang

858
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,799
Cuz he is a villain

859
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,383
Obviously you have course

860
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,967
You shouldn't listen to him

861
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,527
We all do that that's out you're not revealing anything

862
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,087
But it does introduce an interesting question

863
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
And that is

864
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,695
If he's just going to

865
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,999
What research did you do

866
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:48,095
Like what what he says that he does deep research about all this stuff

867
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
And here we get another emails from Wolfgang

868
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:01,151
Later

869
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:07,551
Most of those emails took care of that but

870
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,599
Does David he does extensive research

871
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:15,999
This question that the prosecutor does is another great sort of process

872
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,583
Question in terms of like what do

873
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,959
How do you get the lottery search I have a question for you

874
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
Do it exactly

875
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:31,103
I've noticed a lot of these answers you said

876
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,895
What was going on

877
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,503
You did beat research

878
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,671
News articles about case

879
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
Hello

880
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,791
Lawsuits involving

881
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,839
Research on

882
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,631
Bloomberg play on email

883
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,167
The day before

884
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,727
Getting ready to swing a big event

885
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,311
Whatever

886
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Is what is what really made me question

887
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,831
Babies in incubators in the happen I just saw

888
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,879
The media so on it so ready

889
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,183
I thought that added credibility to it

890
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,743
Bloomberg

891
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,655
And you said your audience

892
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,959
That there was an email that came out in the wall

893
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,591
Get ready in the next 24 hours

894
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
To capitalize on a mass shooting

895
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,199
That didn't happen that's not a real

896
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
Is not real

897
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,207
Bloomberg never told his people

898
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,791
Get ready in the next 24 hours to capitalize on a map

899
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
Organization

900
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Okay

901
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:16,063
Upon Alex to defend his his assertion here

902
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
Because this email doesn't

903
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:23,743
Seems like it

904
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,839
Time ago I don't remember I don't have it in front of me

905
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:34,239
Like most media Outlets we destroy any and all research that we do within one week of

906
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:40,639
Yeah of the story we don't hang onto it at all if your

907
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:45,247
For all this what research do you do Alex Randall's a little bit Pacifica

908
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:50,111
I looked into that email to Bloomberg

909
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,671
Great

910
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
Cool

911
01:10:54,207 --> 01:11:00,351
Questioning the idea that Alex has said that there are

912
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,655
I believe there is a

913
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,983
Remember if the actual clip is in this but

914
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:13,151
The prosecution asked the question of Alex clip

915
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,943
Basically

916
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:21,599
Are still alive and there are pictures of them other Mass tragedies

917
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,439
He's talking specifically about a picture of one of the kids

918
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:31,327
That was apart of the Merle that was made in Pakistan after bombing

919
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,887
And it seems suspicious because everyone was like

920
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,959
This kid died in Pakistan

921
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:41,311
But the reality was if anybody took the time to get into it with

922
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:48,479
Bingo of this attack

923
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,879
I included a picture of one of the kids at Sandy Hook and other tragedies as a like We're All in This Together healing

924
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Yeah whatever

925
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
So

926
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:04,351
He's asked

927
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:09,215
He says that it's out of context

928
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:14,079
The response that the prosecutor gives is one of my favorite things that I've ever heard

929
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,127
It illegal

930
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
This is just great

931
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
Chris Johnson

932
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:40,959
Absol

933
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,895
Contacts

934
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:02,207
There's no way

935
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,767
No way to respond

936
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,327
2 pictures

937
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:13,727
You can stop if there's no way to respond that's a good weight cuz I don't shop

938
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:24,223
What context is literally any context that makes you not look like a monster

939
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:32,415
Wow yeah we were updating ocelo on air one day and that just happened to be

940
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:35,743
Might have said in the updated version of nuts

941
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,047
Still not good.

942
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:44,447
Cuz I'm sure that plays going to think I had to revive

943
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,799
Questioning goes into the idea that Alex

944
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:55,199
A person who was running the honor

945
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,063
And was reporting

946
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:06,463
Copyright strike against the property

947
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,487
Children

948
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:15,167
Ecos / Lenny goes over some of that stuff in the eve is American Life episode if you want

949
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:18,751
Add more contact for that from his own perspective

950
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
Alex

951
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:26,175
Did apparently out Lenny as a person running it up till that point before that

952
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,735
He was running this organization anonymously

953
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:34,111
Really so Alex himself is the one who f***** apparently so

954
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,647
According to this clip

955
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:39,743
Which clearly demonstrates this

956
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,767
On air

957
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
Call Connor

958
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
Correct

959
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,711
And when you learned that

960
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,087
You told your

961
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,391
The owner was run by

962
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,951
You showed address

963
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
And you said

964
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,703
Good luck

965
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,239
Mr.

966
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:24,799
2050

967
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,679
U-Haul rental

968
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,855
If a person

969
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,647
What's a Stakeout

970
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,959
Foundation

971
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
And you're the one who

972
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:13,087
He was running site trying to get people

973
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Anonymous front

974
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,447
No I was not aware of that

975
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,471
We were

976
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:36,127
Do not take credit for a scoop

977
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:42,783
He always broke on Infowars and supply

978
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:49,183
Some reporter

979
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:55,583
Getting the bed the one time he picks up an address

980
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:01,215
It could be a crime

981
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:07,103
Galaxy fold a shirt collards

982
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,919
Turned into a cartoon

983
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,967
Listen to go get a switch.

984
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:18,111
Like that is the sort of stuff that we haven't encountered in are going over the Sandy Hooks

985
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:24,511
It's always heard like the idea that they gave out address

986
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,815
To a little bit

987
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:33,215
Well we didn't cover February in 22 know that wasn't part of our 2015 no

988
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:39,615
2020

989
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
Never

990
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:44,479
About addresses literally

991
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:50,879
Jbab address

992
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:57,279
Yeah it's the stuff

993
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,583
Is even more tops

994
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,655
I sort of set-up punchline kind of thing

995
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
Where

996
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:07,775
The prosecution in the first clip plays Alex threatening

997
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,079
To go to to Newtown

998
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,127
Next clip

999
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Freeplays

1000
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,175
Just answer it

1001
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,527
The demonstration of Infowars coming to Newtown

1002
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:23,135
This is the really damning stuff I believe especially

1003
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,671
Presented back-to-back

1004
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,487
And with Alex's responses

1005
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:32,607
Mr. Jones I want to talk a little bit more about that episode on February 12th 2015

1006
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,703
And I want to show you a clip

1007
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,239
Your message

1008
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,143
So for complaining you were going to bring Infowars

1009
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,703
Edward Burns

1010
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:12,031
I have no idea what

1011
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
For complaining

1012
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,664
Bringing forward

1013
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,576
Koala couple months later

1014
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,840
Couple months later

1015
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,912
Spring 2015

1016
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,216
You said this man

1017
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
Cage fighter

1018
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,128
No

1019
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,408
No

1020
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Yes

1021
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,488
It's from June 8th

1022
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
2015

1023
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:23,968
Really difficult

1024
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,808
Infowars Alex is going to try and pretend didn't work for Infowars

1025
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:33,440
The courthouse baddest cover up into false flag

1026
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,000
Going to get theirs

1027
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:43,680
Through a little bit of it just because the sound is so rough

1028
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,008
But at the end he identifies himself and his credentials as

1029
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,824
Infowars

1030
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,136
Anissa Jones those are hardly the only people

1031
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Harassed

1032
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,976
Correct

1033
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Correct

1034
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:56,896
Bad news

1035
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:03,296
Clear demonstration clips that Alex is saying so I'm going to go

1036
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:09,696
No punch back a little bit videos

1037
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,720
Copyright law

1038
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:17,120
Credentials

1039
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Wards.com

1040
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:22,752
Goes and makes videos where he harasses all these people Alex plays those videos

1041
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:28,896
It's hard to see a connection between intent as action

1042
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:32,480
Is pretty well laid out that's sort of

1043
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:38,880
Linear line

1044
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:45,280
About copyright and the First Amendment

1045
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:50,400
That would be at

1046
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,288
So what's even weirder

1047
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,336
Is it this point in the deposition

1048
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:04,736
Where weaves

1049
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
Boston

1050
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,368
Vegas prosecutor is just coming into being like nothing stupid you just got that from

1051
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:19,840
All right you don't need to respond to all of those cuz otherwise you're going to lose your voice

1052
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,656
You're going to lose your voice

1053
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,984
So what's the pricing is it at this point

1054
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
Alex

1055
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:32,640
Expresses that he does still believe that something's up but something's up

1056
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:39,040
Which is a weird thing to be saying in this deposition

1057
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:41,344
Insanity

1058
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,880
See what you think on the other side of

1059
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,488
You don't believe the official story

1060
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,792
You think there was cover

1061
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,328
You think there was a manipulation

1062
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:55,680
You think yes I still think

1063
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
I think children died

1064
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,776
Holly.

1065
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,824
Wherever wherever did you watch

1066
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,896
Can I go back

1067
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
Then

1068
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,280
More actually the real anomaly

1069
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,096
It's just the school system and government trying to cover it

1070
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:24,864
Re-read

1071
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,912
From from from from liability

1072
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,360
Shooter

1073
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,664
Where is helicopters

1074
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,480
I still have questions about Sandy Hook

1075
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,528
But I've

1076
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,832
No people

1077
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,392
You know some families they say no it's real

1078
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:54,560
Credible like you did with Wolfgang halbig a couple years ago

1079
01:25:55,072 --> 01:26:01,216
Right about that guy in the woods

1080
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,520
Back up later so we can just leave that aside

1081
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:08,640
It is pretty crazy that Alex is still like sticking to some sort of a gun here

1082
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,736
With the idea that like something

1083
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,296
Cuz you don't need to say that

1084
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,136
Could have stopped

1085
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:25,280
Prosecutor wasn't going to ask you was responding

1086
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:28,096
Upon himself

1087
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:33,728
Also I don't believe that he's done

1088
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,384
I don't think that it's appropriate for the idea of a school trying to cover liability

1089
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,432
Like that conspiracy is

1090
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,712
Very small

1091
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,504
Look at terms of scope

1092
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,904
I don't think it merits this kind of attention any of the things that Alex did

1093
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,208
It is that words the truth

1094
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,024
Like if it were just the situation that he's trying to say

1095
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,608
Corporate malfeasance the school district trying not to get food

1096
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,264
You have gone too far for true that deserves

1097
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,592
I believe my neighbor killed his wife because of course she is still alive

1098
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:16,992
However I must say that when the insurance adjuster came he inflated the cost of his car

1099
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:23,648
There are still some question right

1100
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:27,744
Just about another angle is entire thing and braided

1101
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,144
Gross amount

1102
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,496
Thankfully I did that because

1103
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:50,272
Fraud with the insurance company

1104
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:52,576
This week

1105
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:57,440
Let me tell you what Lisa is doing in the break room or mine.

1106
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:03,840
Bulshit smoking Outback she's flipping out at recess and smoking behind the building

1107
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:10,496
Crazy questions

1108
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
Right

1109
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,896
So

1110
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:22,272
It's unexpected but still kind of like

1111
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:28,672
Next clip we get to see on display Alex's delusion about the consequences of his

1112
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
His actions

1113
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:34,048
Because he's directly asked if he thinks that he's wrong for the families

1114
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,840
Of the victims and the survivors

1115
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,632
You

1116
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:50,688
You don't

1117
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,480
Lawyers

1118
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,040
Walmart this for fame

1119
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:01,184
Try to get the

1120
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,816
No I didn't only question

1121
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:11,936
Government

1122
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,728
Not

1123
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,848
I do not know I'm not wrong with her

1124
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:25,504
I mean that's that's kind of like how unflappable

1125
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,576
Because that's a mistake

1126
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:34,976
Lawyers

1127
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,280
So

1128
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:43,680
Would you like fries or what are we talking about here

1129
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:48,288
Wronged them for all the families

1130
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,616
To all that answer is an indication of

1131
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,408
Like I didn't do anything wrong

1132
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:58,784
Write an unwillingness to engage with the complaints that many many people are making about him

1133
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:02,880
Into more narrative

1134
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:09,280
It's really interesting the way the structure of this went because there were like there were some narratives upfront deteriorate

1135
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,840
Some more General conversation

1136
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:18,240
And then he gets more narratives here at this point that it sort of has waves to it

1137
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:22,848
A little bit and I think part of that is because Alex is someone who

1138
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:29,248
You just need slipper you can't nail him down position expecting like you were going to ask leading questions

1139
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:35,648
Exactly the responses you wanted you're a fool

1140
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
He is really

1141
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,208
To this guy's advantage

1142
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:43,840
Because you can go hit this point move around a little bit respond to something he says

1143
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:50,240
Elicit the I didn't wrong people I still think something's up with her

1144
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,800
You never really would have expected you would get out of him

1145
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:56,640
And so maybe there's a win somewhere there but we get back to narratives now

1146
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,944
And Alex has made the claim

1147
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,736
Multiple times

1148
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,016
There was a

1149
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,552
Please stand down

1150
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:09,952
The buffets in Parkland

1151
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,232
Is it means nothing

1152
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:15,584
He's pressed on it and he can't defend his assertion that all

1153
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,656
State Police

1154
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:27,872
If you think it's a reference to the state police going public about their being a stamp

1155
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,200
I told you the mostest I can remember

1156
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,680
You should remember that

1157
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,496
Give me a sec

1158
01:31:54,752 --> 01:32:00,896
I'm thinking of Life coming over tonight

1159
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,944
Metro process

1160
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
I do remember

1161
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,272
That's not a mental process

1162
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:11,392
You know what we really should have gotten hand signals

1163
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:17,536
I really should have got to save me answer because I got

1164
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:23,936
You don't like the idea of police going public regarding a shooting of

1165
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,216
Elementary school children

1166
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,056
If you are ever going to save if that's the case

1167
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
Publicly

1168
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:36,224
It really is something you should keep in your back pocket forever

1169
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,040
You should be honest the lawn you should

1170
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
That's the other thing too

1171
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,856
We've seen Alex

1172
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,880
Pull out these

1173
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:49,280
14 pieces of information on his show whenever he needs to like little things

1174
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:55,680
References

1175
01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:02,080
They're all bad

1176
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:05,920
He can't just like rattle off some some nonsensical thing

1177
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:11,552
Because it'll be under oath in on the record

1178
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:16,672
We know that you realize you were on your show you'd remember remember

1179
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:23,584
So the next of the gets brought up is the idea that Alex's said that Rescue helicopters weren't sent but should have been

1180
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:26,144
And ambulances should have been dispatched

1181
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,936
What do you know

1182
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,472
This one's bad too

1183
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,360
How's the weather

1184
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,760
I take it you

1185
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,528
You don't know

1186
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
How long is

1187
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Hartford

1188
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
Dispatch

1189
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:51,744
Calm down.

1190
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,424
You don't know how long it

1191
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Dispatch

1192
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,544
Perry Hospital

1193
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:08,896
I was going off how big and others

1194
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,432
Professors analysis

1195
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:16,832
Okay that's just how big I

1196
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:27,328
And thinks he's been sued brings up pizza apologize

1197
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:33,984
This is your life

1198
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,520
I can't remember exactly

1199
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:41,920
But he does bring up how like he's used bad sources to misidentify the Parkland shooter he brings up

1200
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,016
Chobani flip

1201
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,832
Alex might have accidentally reopened

1202
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,880
Is Chobani lawsuit

1203
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:53,696
Because we we listened to his apology about it

1204
01:34:53,952 --> 01:35:00,096
We know that he apologized and we got this all wrong

1205
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,912
You apologize to Chobani though right

1206
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,984
Call M40 migrant rapist

1207
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:13,152
That was a technical Thing versus Thurman

1208
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,832
It was a board member

1209
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,624
Lobster box

1210
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,816
You did Apologize

1211
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:38,240
The Federal Reserve member which is not an accurate way to describe the Humvee look high up at

1212
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:44,640
Tattoo he's the policies of

1213
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,944
The first thing I would do is

1214
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:52,320
That's not it is void is done

1215
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,600
You going back in court

1216
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:56,928
Does he have some tattoo right but it was

1217
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,464
Another good one

1218
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,304
Alex

1219
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:06,400
That should be reopened based on that statement under oath

1220
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:12,800
Underoath I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't if I was a Barnes here

1221
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:19,200
Little bit larger and louder

1222
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:25,600
Go back to over and over again it's like for them if they don't work for Infowars as billable hours

1223
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:29,696
Just getting words like

1224
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,792
A cash register sound

1225
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,328
So

1226
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:41,728
Ask about Alex's conjecture about Anderson Cooper

1227
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
Disappearing

1228
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:45,056
Being a green screen

1229
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:49,920
When reality experts have gone on record as a compression problem with

1230
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:53,248
The video files or upload it

1231
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,136
And so Alex gets into this long thing about how he's an expert on on green screen

1232
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:05,536
And you knows all about them

1233
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,328
Conversation the two of them are having

1234
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:10,144
Where is like

1235
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:16,544
Align

1236
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,872
There's a wheel

1237
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:20,896
Who cares

1238
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,664
It's

1239
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
It is neither here nor there

1240
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:27,040
But it brings up to probably my favorite thing

1241
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,344
That this prosecutor does on this episode

1242
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,648
And that is

1243
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,464
Fall into a f****** huge trap

1244
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,816
Nothing to do

1245
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,352
Put it Delights me

1246
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,888
Service First clip

1247
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,168
The Trap is set

1248
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:50,336
Is it only is involved at all because it has to do with our doesn't know anything about green screen

1249
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:54,688
Proves that he has no business saying that Anderson Cooper his nose disappeared because of a green screen

1250
01:37:54,944 --> 01:38:00,064
Still kind of related but it's still tertiary that I love it dammit this is great

1251
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,832
Here's the setup

1252
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:04,416
One of the reasons that you were suspicious about this interview

1253
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,888
In fact one of the things you brought up

1254
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,568
I want to play you a video really quick

1255
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,848
Something you said

1256
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,384
May 13th

1257
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
44

1258
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,456
About these boots

1259
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,896
Number to Jones

1260
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,664

God

1262
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:13,536
It is nice to know that he can smell it he doesn't know what it is but you know what you can smell it

1263
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:19,936
Don't know I don't know

1264
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:28,128
Earnest that like go bad

1265
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:34,528
You have to say right now because I know it's going to come back and bite

1266
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,600
I know

1267
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,744
Now here is where Alex willingly put himself in

1268
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,048
John Simon hands you would have Mark

1269
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
From the Charles

1270
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:56,032
Broadcast

1271
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,872
And this was something that some

1272
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,152
Recorded

1273
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,296
You've shown

1274
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,576
Video

1275
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,600
And what

1276
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,512
Has received from here

1277
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,048
You could see kind of on though

1278
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,840
Left hand side

1279
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,376
Inside of your screen resistor

1280
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,984
Because I left it on

1281
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,992
Location

1282
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,808
Yeah it's not like

1283
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:49,280
Screen

1284
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,560
Computer

1285
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,080
What is Robin mark

1286
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
I didn't get that far

1287
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,944
We're Sawyer was given access

1288
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
Studio

1289
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:16,672
He's acted Alex a picture of another news network with the same backdrop

1290
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,464
No

1291
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,072
Good work

1292
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:27,424
No they were

1293
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,704
You've never seen

1294
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,824
No I believe that's

1295
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:36,384
CNN CVS partners

1296
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:42,272
Nice so I take it you never done any sort of research

1297
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,192
You've never seen

1298
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,752
International Hotel Riyadh Saudi Arabia

1299
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,872
Broadcasting from

1300
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,200
Shake it on the market

1301
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,392
You've never seen the photographs

1302
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:24,512
The satellite setup for the major networks at the International Hotel in Riyadh Saudi

1303
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,704
Jayco admits

1304
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:39,616
Charles Jake Osteen

1305
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,480
So you're maintaining

1306
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,504
And that shot

1307
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:47,808
Closet

1308
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
And not

1309
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,168
They were saying they were there

1310
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:17,248
That shot was in front of the International Hotel in Riyadh

1311
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,272
That was not a

1312
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,320
Galaxy

1313
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:25,952
The gas mask on

1314
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,720
You said

1315
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,768
Broadcast

1316
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,792
Atlanta

1317
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,840
When they said they were in Riyadh

1318
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,144
You are wrong that was fun

1319
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:35,424
They were actually

1320
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,728
Euclid

1321
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,544
When you were saying

1322
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,104
That they were not in Riyadh

1323
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,200
I think you're mixing things

1324
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,784
Okemos

1325
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,368
Yeah

1326
01:43:54,624 --> 01:44:00,768
So great about this little workouts does to confirm Orion

1327
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
Enforce

1328
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,840
The argument

1329
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:07,424
It's so Salient to the Anderson Cooper thing

1330
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:13,824
Because it's the exact same thing he said that he was pretending he was on location

1331
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,152
Studio

1332
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:20,992
And the same thing is that

1333
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:25,600
So it appears to be tertiary but in reality it's so connected

1334
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:28,672
It's such a demonstration of the exact same behavior

1335
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:34,560
That was before you were wrong about that also

1336
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,864
Good work

1337
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:41,472
The big question I have right now

1338
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,544
Now that we know for a fact

1339
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,104
What Alex does

1340
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,920
In regards to research is 0

1341
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:55,296
Right we we have it pretty much legally proven that he did not work

1342
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:59,392
Mortar that later

1343
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,440
What does he do

1344
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,256
Besides talk for 3 hours

1345
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:07,840
He drinks a lot

1346
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,656
From everything we can tell

1347
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:17,056
You know I bet he shows up pretty close to when show starts

1348
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:20,384
Probably take some super male vitality

1349
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:27,040
He doesn't show and he's shown up for another show later and he's

1350
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:32,416
Drunk or something like that

1351
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:35,232
That's a 6-hour whatever

1352
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:41,632
Just started drinking it like whenever he gets off there and then whatever happened

1353
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,240
How is new strategy is going out in public and

1354
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:52,640
Solar eclipse will go viral on the internet

1355
01:45:53,920 --> 01:46:00,064
Have someone follow him for a day

1356
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:07,488
In like a post office

1357
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:14,144
Sourcing issues

1358
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,704
The idea like where does your information come from

1359
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:23,360
Answer their guy brings up the idea that Alex said that was a false flag

1360
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,992
So

1361
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:32,576
This is introduced into the proceedings the idea that Las Vegas was all fake

1362
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:37,696
All that stuff earlier we heard that the prosecutor

1363
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:45,120
For more details about that earn

1364
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:47,936
That Alex had to sign a non-disclosure agreement

1365
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:53,568
To find out information about safety

1366
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,664
Disclosures

1367
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,200
Weather information

1368
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,480
You suck

1369
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:04,320
What about

1370
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,112
General Papa

1371
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,160
Chicago

1372
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:08,928
Apparently

1373
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,048
Is relevant to the allegations

1374
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,936
4 reasons

1375
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:26,336
Was that was that a government person

1376
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:30,688
B2

1377
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
Was it a corporate

1378
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,280
Was it a real person or in

1379
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:48,864
The contract

1380
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:13,952
Could be a problem

1381
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,488
There should be

1382
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:18,304
Stop

1383
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,376
It's not a problem

1384
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:28,032
I assume that's not real because of course I do otherwise I believe that this is

1385
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:35,712
You know if it is not real

1386
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,528
Cuz that could come into court

1387
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:43,136
Have to show the end

1388
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:46,720
In order for the to be enforceable

1389
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,680
Because it might not be super relevant

1390
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:59,008
I'm surprised I'm surprised

1391
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:03,104
NBA's somewhere else

1392
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:09,760
You know as a quick get-out-of-jail-free

1393
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,552
NBA with wolf

1394
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:18,208
What are you going to do with that job perhaps

1395
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:24,608
This is one instance where there is the illusion of who would enforce

1396
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,800
It's ridiculous

1397
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:42,016
Shooter

1398
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,296
What is going on

1399
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:49,952
So

1400
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,512
Conversation turns into more General sources

1401
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:57,376
But he gets his chatter from

1402
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:03,008
That's of course

1403
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,032
Fortune

1404
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:10,944
Yes

1405
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,248
Signed random

1406
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,112
Import

1407
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:18,880
Freak

1408
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:19,904
4-channel

1409
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,000
We reported on things being recorded

1410
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:32,192
Yes ok Google

1411
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,504
No

1412
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:49,344
We talked about

1413
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,768
We talked earlier about

1414
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,048
Miss identifying depart

1415
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Last year

1416
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,216
I don't remember that

1417
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,952
Chatter

1418
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,488
4chan someone

1419
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:30,816
Email

1420
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,472
Specifically

1421
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:40,032
That there were people on internet

1422
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,824
Internet with talk

1423
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,408
Future

1424
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,480
Videos for situation

1425
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,552
They were showing a lot of things

1426
01:51:54,624 --> 01:52:00,768
Sources of information that you're going to report on as if they are

1427
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:07,168
Real things are an anonymous message board and

1428
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:13,568
Probably

1429
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:19,968
Research my problem solved

1430
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:22,528
He's a man of the people

1431
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,808
So now

1432
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,344
This is probably

1433
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,392
About the where this thing

1434
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:31,488
There's still a little bit after this but this is the crescendo

1435
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:38,912
The guy prosecutor is trying to ask Alex if he understands why another Sandy Hook

1436
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:42,240
He's trying to get

1437
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:48,640
He's trying to get Alex to recognize that there is caused this

1438
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:52,992
Being something that is randomly being done to him Alex

1439
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:56,576
Really understand what's going on with the line of questioning

1440
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:59,136
And then everything explodes

1441
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,184
This goes so crazy

1442
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:06,304
Pacific broadcast

1443
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,584
Yes

1444
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,864
Are you telling me

1445
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,168
So you don't know sitting here right now

1446
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,448
What broadcast PC

1447
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,104
Pacific

1448
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:23,968
Call know I'm asking you right now it's what I want

1449
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
Do you even know

1450
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:27,040
What mystery

1451
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:43,168
Saudia if you couldn't hear that the objection that's being made is not the form objection to scope

1452
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:49,568
Yeah this is about

1453
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,592
About the problem

1454
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
Right

1455
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:58,784
Fifth personal knowledge you can answer if you're are you instructing him

1456
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,856
Okay

1457
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,136
You can go in there

1458
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,720
I don't know what the score

1459
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,000
I've no idea what

1460
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,304
Is there something that you ordered

1461
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:19,008
Weather

1462
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
What's the fame

1463
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,056
Is relevant

1464
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:22,592
Mycase

1465
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:26,432
You know that did the

1466
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,712
Don't even start

1467
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,576
I would rather you

1468
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,880
Extraordinary

1469
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:39,232
We're not going to do this to you

1470
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:47,680
No I don't think so

1471
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,960
RFP

1472
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,240
No I don't think so

1473
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:56,640
I don't think the scope of no mystery knock I don't think the scope of

1474
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:03,040
Direction was identical to the scope of deposition and many many times

1475
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:07,904
No you can't ask questions

1476
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:14,560
And I would appreciate it.

1477
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,328
Defending

1478
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,352
This deposition

1479
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:25,312
It is not appropriate for you to speak

1480
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:28,128
I want you to

1481
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:36,832
Being obstructive not defending

1482
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,392
If you cannot agree be quiet

1483
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,000
Are you going to stay and be quiet or am I going to have to ask

1484
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:54,496
I am and if you leave again if you keep peeking I guarantee you I will

1485
01:55:56,032 --> 01:56:02,176
I hope you did

1486
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:12,160
Qd2

1487
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
Call Dad

1488
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:19,328
You need to stop talking you're not the lawyer who sent the request for production

1489
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
That were

1490
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:29,312
Requested

1491
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,384
Related to all that

1492
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:36,480
I'm & broke.

1493
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,016
Based on statements by the court

1494
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:44,416
Yeah the judge to do that you have to request them to produce this document of this document in the judge

1495
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:50,816
Will say they need to do this don't need to request this one break

1496
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:51,584
Ask about it

1497
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,608
Right right

1498
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:59,008
This is them doing that but they haven't done in other instances because

1499
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:01,056
I think it's a really really bad

1500
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:07,200
Things to have on the record the idea that Alex doesn't understand why you being sued

1501
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:09,760
That is something that is

1502
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:12,576
It paints him in such an inhuman way

1503
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,344
That like

1504
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:16,160
I don't I don't know how you could

1505
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:20,512
Deposition

1506
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:24,864
Yeah oldest and asking Alex like you really have no idea

1507
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:29,216
Why these people are mad at you

1508
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,008
It would be so ugly

1509
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,032
Psychics

1510
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:35,616
Interference

1511
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:42,016
The question was dropped and they moved on to another question

1512
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,040
Goal that it needed to

1513
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:48,416
I was kind of amusing remark about how

1514
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:54,816
When I wear defending depositions we don't tag team you guys I think he was talking about like for deposition

1515
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,776
I think you might be right too

1516
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:10,432
Another line and that is his businesses

1517
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:15,552
And this is a fruitless lying to go down in terms of this

1518
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:21,952
Belk close to that it's a fruitless line to go down because the lawyers can just say like

1519
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:28,096
Objection based on privacy

1520
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:31,680
Might disclose private information about

1521
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:34,752
It is outside of what might be appropriate to

1522
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:37,312
Ask Alex as an individual

1523
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,616
But if that doesn't stop

1524
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:46,016
Alex from accidentally revealing a little piece of information LLC

1525
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:50,624
I want to talk a little bit about Infowars LLC

1526
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,928
Have you ever taken money from

1527
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,288
Okay

1528
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,080
Takeout

1529
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:17,760
Infowars Elsie is it ever had any money

1530
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,160
What

1531
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,960
Your allegation

1532
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,496
Corporation

1533
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,416
Nobody else is involved

1534
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,376
Infowars LLC

1535
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,144
What to do

1536
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,192
Was it a gun

1537
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:12,800
I don't know

1538
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:19,200
I don't know

1539
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,992
Sure that is

1540
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:30,464
Without the earlier. I imagine he would at least be able to say

1541
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,000
Media operation

1542
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
That's free speech system

1543
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:38,400
Systems LLC isramedia operation

1544
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:44,800
Alex Alex legitimately doesn't know what it is

1545
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:49,664
Ronnie comes back

1546
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,968
Something to do with like

1547
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:58,368
The domains for the website

1548
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:04,768
It leads me to believe that he may have understood what it was when he started or earlier in the business

1549
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:08,352
But now someone else is involved with all that s*** he doesn't

1550
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:14,752
He doesn't bother himself with any of the corporate structure of things

1551
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,288
Know what these business is

1552
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:22,688
I am

1553
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:29,088
Cuz he also presented

1554
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:35,488
Existing in the same space as I don't know what Infowars loc does

1555
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,792
That could only mean to

1556
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,608
That kind of a declaration means to me

1557
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,168
Either you legitimately doesn't

1558
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:45,728
Believable but weird

1559
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:52,384
He knows of something f***** up

1560
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:56,992
That's a possibility it's not as likely I think not knowing legitimately

1561
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,808
I think just being a person who like

1562
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:04,416
Is woefully unprepared to be asked any question

1563
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:09,536
It's pretty amazed he didn't did his lawyers even like

1564
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:13,120
Practice with him I think they practice on their own

1565
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:20,288
Scrub Jackson we went out to dinner together and objected each other

1566
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:26,688
Solitaire

1567
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:32,576
What's the new name for Dave daubenmire show

1568
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,976
Get back to Wolfgang halbig and that whole situation

1569
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:45,632
And Wolfgang at all

1570
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,424
Breath Alex is presenting it as like

1571
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:51,008
You want it to appear that he tried to

1572
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:52,032
Which is weird

1573
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,824
So are you saying that

1574
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,848
Add a resume

1575
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:04,320
We did try to fact-checking

1576
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:06,624
Secrecy

1577
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:08,928
Up around it around

1578
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,000
Hartford Courant other

1579

Preferred workout

1581
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,912
Thanks. We checked out

1582
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:40,672
Recirculation has been

1583
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:47,328
Nuts in public

1584
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:49,632
Most Airport

1585
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:05,760
Okay not the deposition

1586
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:11,392
Not the not the parts where that it's proves what I was saying is not true

1587
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:17,792
We were reading and just reported all that stuff

1588
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:32,640
Terrible

1589
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:43,648
There was so much

1590
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:48,000
I was like alright whatever dude you just you don't want to have to actually say

1591
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:51,840
I didn't give a s*** I didn't look into any more life what's going on

1592
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:58,496
We find out

1593
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:02,336
What time it happened you don't know anything about the building

1594
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:06,688
He doesn't know how far is it to closest hospital with a helicopter is

1595
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:08,992
He doesn't understand helicopter rescue

1596
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:15,392
Turn off

1597
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:17,184
Understand

1598
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:19,232
And that leads us to this next clip

1599
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:22,816
Where he doesn't understand the consequences of his own action

1600
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:25,376
He doesn't really seem to even give a s***

1601
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:32,800
I don't

1602
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:34,592
You don't know that there was a woman

1603
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:35,872
Infowars follower

1604
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,664
Federal Prison

1605
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:40,736
Parents

1606
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:49,952
And you know that

1607
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:51,232
Very shortly after

1608
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,560
Personal email address

1609
02:05:59,424 --> 02:05:59,936
Nowhere

1610
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,984
So I did not do what you say

1611
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:04,288
Okay

1612
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:10,688
That's an interesting different denial

1613
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:14,784
This woman angel

1614
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:22,976
Physically or he denied another crime logical conclusion of the rhetoric that you put into the world

1615
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,768
Person I heard him

1616
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,536
Right

1617
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:31,936
Stock news people in threatens them he doesn't know her name when brought up or it maybe is lying

1618
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:38,080
Doesn't know but actually not knowing

1619
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:44,480
And doesn't seem to give a s*** when it's brought up

1620
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:48,320
You gave out that address and stuff

1621
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:52,928
Not connected I would like to ask you a question

1622
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:54,464
Do you understand causality

1623
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:58,560
Objection from Farm

1624
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:03,424
Thank you very much Alex

1625
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:09,824
Bars likes good workout Eclipse cuz they're just more puncture

1626
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,616
Narratives and Alex

1627
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:18,272
Reported about parents not being able to touch their kids

1628
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:23,904
Which was something that was brought up.

1629
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,976
And today is like where did you get that information from

1630
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,768
Is there one human being

1631
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:32,352
Then you can point to that you got that information from an hour cuz nothing

1632
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:38,752
And then there's another one another one another narrative is

1633
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:43,104
Here in the woods and Alex's

1634
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:49,504
And what he's pressed on it more it comes out a guy in camo pants

1635
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,576
Do you think it's appropriate

1636
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:57,184
To call camo pants SWAT gear

1637
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:03,584
You're crazy

1638
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:09,984
Oh my God

1639
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:16,384
Young for a while

1640
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:23,808
Yeah that's true

1641
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:27,904
So I skip-a-long from all this because I think this is more important

1642
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,464
Here as we doubt

1643
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,232
Towards the end

1644
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:36,352
Assistant on presenting himself

1645
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,120
As the victor

1646
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,656
Because of course

1647
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:45,056
This is particularly distasteful. But why all this is happening

1648
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:48,896
Only person to question Sandy Hook

1649
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:54,016
I legitimately asked those questions because I had concerns

1650
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:59,136
Corporate lawyers establishment of Democratic Party

1651
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,416
How to make a smile

1652
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:05,280
Constipated

1653

1654
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:08,096
Can I see the parties

1655
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:13,984
Dillons

1656
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:21,408
Apologize for that

1657
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:24,992
Seem very same corporate lawyers

1658
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:29,088
Shane all these things exaggerating

1659
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,904
Using the First Amendment

1660
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,440
Chris Johnson

1661
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:35,232
Corporate lawyer

1662
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:45,728
You and others continued are in the news

1663
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:52,640
Versus Boston

1664
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:59,552
Shawsheen the real disingenuousness

1665
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:01,856
And the fact is all just cold-blooded

1666
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:04,416
Hillary lost the election

1667
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:14,144
I know this is what Hillary lost a light switch went on it ever been sued

1668
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:19,264
Call the corporate media working in tandem

1669
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:24,384
I know you're working with a Connecticut case and doing all that and all that stuff

1670
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:27,968
Let's not and is going to be some other things come in a roll

1671
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:34,880
What are the things Alex

1672
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:40,768
Ever put the final report I needed the report

1673
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:44,864
47

1674
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,400
Hope Davis

1675
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:52,288
What report the official Sandy Hook report

1676
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:55,616
I was put out a local state and federal government

1677
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,664
So you you were going to sit here

1678
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,552
Online since December

1679
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,320
113

1680
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:07,904
Are there been summer that the reports put out but it was a big deal

1681
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:11,488
Supreme Court

1682
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:15,328
So usually litigated situation of other spring so surprised

1683
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:18,656
I do like that like

1684
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:26,592
I'm just being like

1685
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:31,200
Let's move this on the report came out

1686
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:37,856
I also love that like poop

1687
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:44,256
The state local and Federal

1688
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:46,560
That's ridiculous

1689
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:48,864
So we get to the issue of

1690
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:54,496
Profit in this next clip is making money off of these

1691
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:56,800
Narratives that he's putting out that we've all

1692
02:11:57,056 --> 02:12:01,408
Throughout all this he can't defend in the light of day and if he has to

1693
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:08,064
Sleep is that a dead or it's Wolfgang halbig father just going off what he said

1694
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:11,648
I stopped Escape here about the idea that he's making money off this b*******

1695
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:13,184
You made money

1696
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:15,488
From every single one

1697
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:22,400
No we actually lose money on really controversial stuff we can actually

1698
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,704
Oh so you can produce

1699
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:28,032
New house

1700
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:33,664
Advertisement separate from

1701
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:42,368
Which of the two don't go together

1702
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:59,264
In the same video

1703
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:05,920
It's like it's like saying the Super Bowl goes to the Super Bowl has Budweiser ads

1704
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:12,320
Give me Cemex money off of the broadcast

1705
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:17,696
Advertising is separate from what is going on in the program product placement

1706
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:28,192
So I'm excited for him to produce

1707
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:29,472
F****** balls

1708
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:35,872
The advertising the content or separate separate

1709
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:39,968
The Superbowl knows ads

1710
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:46,368
Realize is that Alex Jones has pills

1711
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:48,416
Company pays him for each

1712
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:54,816
Hey dad on his own

1713
02:13:55,072 --> 02:14:01,216
But it's a separate company actually might make sense it might be a better way

1714
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:05,824
Yourself

1715
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:08,384
Stupid stupid stupid and crazy crazy

1716
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:15,040
Clips left in the first one

1717
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:19,136
It almost flies under the radar because of how awful this is

1718
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:23,488
We will see it doesn't really matter

1719
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:29,632
Which is kind of a downer but that's kind of what we do

1720
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:30,656
Incredibly Tara

1721
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,448
You would agree with me

1722
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:40,640
Call Sumter

1723
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,176
You lost

1724
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,760
Whether it's intentional

1725
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:47,040
Weather

1726
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,240
What is the agenda behind

1727
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:08,032
What

1728
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:11,872
So much

1729
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,944
Analyze question

1730
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,224
So

1731
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,760
That's f***** up

1732
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:22,112
You know the inverse must be true

1733
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:26,976
I want to go down that road.

1734
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:34,912
They haven't been

1735
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:41,568
Write all of these things are I guess true

1736
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:46,688
Entire experience of the entire universe yes there's some people who have cried wolf

1737
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:53,344
One of them is probably Alex what the hell

1738
02:15:53,856 --> 02:16:00,000
Now the problem is that you're in a deposition about lying about them a tremendous amount of

1739
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,936
You can't take that outside of the context

1740
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:10,240
In this deposition

1741
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:12,544
That is very heavily implying

1742
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,336
That's some of these people

1743
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:20,736
Who are the victims of the family members of victims of this horrible tragedy

1744
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,272
The pain that they're in

1745
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:26,368
Unspeakably f***** up I think

1746
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:29,696
On some level

1747
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,976
Anna Anna position

1748
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,256
Babies worse

1749
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:34,816
Then him calling these people actors

1750
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:41,984
Because if they're actors

1751
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:46,592
You want to go just go all out

1752
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:53,248
Liquor earlier when he was saying that like yeah I still f***** up

1753
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:56,576
What specifically is up

1754
02:16:57,344 --> 02:17:00,928
Nothing compared to this the sort of thing at the ends here

1755
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:02,976
Like this is the headline

1756
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:09,376
This is the headline

1757
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:11,168
In some way

1758
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:16,032
Pretending they're hurt when they're not only to attack him

1759
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:17,056
Bucked up

1760
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:23,968
And in his earlier his earlier statement

1761
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:25,248
Is it a taxable

1762
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:26,784
But even his previous like

1763
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,088
I still have some questions about Sandy Hook

1764
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:32,160
Does leave open for him the idea that

1765
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:33,440
Well

1766
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:39,072
Either they had what they had coming to him or they were just you know casualties of War

1767
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:41,888
We're still going after the bad guys

1768
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,936
And these people are immaterial

1769
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:48,288
They're just side I'm not sure but whatever it is is bad

1770
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:50,848
That's f***** up

1771
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:51,872
It doesn't matter

1772
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:53,664
Is this house a deposition at

1773
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,224
The school

1774
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,248
Is closed

1775
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:01,088
That's not question

1776
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,024
What other people were saying and

1777
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:16,192
The Hartford Courant headline Weiser cover up wire no documents being released

1778
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:19,264
Taking so long headlines

1779
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,288
Weren't allowed

1780
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:22,336
Question

1781
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:24,896
Correct

1782
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:25,920
Text message

1783
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:33,600
Joan

1784
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:35,904
You finally prepared

1785
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,696
That you have

1786
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,488
Call Ethan

1787
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:48,192
I am not prepared to sign on to whatever you were the Mesa media makeup about

1788
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,104
There is no shame

1789
02:18:55,872 --> 02:19:02,016
There is no ability to wrestle with the consequences of actions and so it's almost pointless to

1790
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:03,296
2

1791
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:09,696
If that was all this was I would say

1792
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:13,792
But I think because of the approaches that were made in terms of

1793
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:16,096
Taking the angle of like

1794
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:18,912
You used to work you-do-it Infowars is

1795
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,728
Fundamentally flawed you never check anything

1796
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:25,824
Making him so to talk about that I think that's a fantastic approach

1797
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:28,640
Similarly

1798
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:35,040
But he clearly doesn't know about but should the question of if you knew about this that's problem

1799
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:41,440
If you don't know about this that's a problem right those sorts of things are really good ways to approach

1800
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:42,464
Alex

1801
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,232
So

1802
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:48,096
Even though we come to the end and it's just like you got the receipt you got the evidence

1803
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:54,752
He doesn't give a s*** I'm not going to admit I did anything wrong I don't care

1804
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:57,824
Whatever like

1805
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:04,224
It doesn't mean that there's not the pieces that are valuable with him still

1806
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:10,624
And they're thinking that he was going.

1807
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:14,208
Expectations were of course adjusted appropriately

1808
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:20,608
Got a lot of material good out of it

1809
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:27,008
Although he probably

1810
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:30,592
I saw the people posting about the videos

1811
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:36,224
Before I got into it

1812
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:42,624
I thought that there was a criminal penalty for lying like a civil deposition

1813
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:45,440
I was like

1814
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:53,120
You know that was the first thought I had and then the second thought I had was like this is probably going to be a dud the approach

1815
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:55,168
She's going to be a disaster it's going to be useless

1816
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:01,824
No actually go through it and see if it is valuable

1817
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,360
Is it

1818
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,896
It's heartening in Subway's

1819
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:08,992
Covering it with the

1820
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:15,392
Lead of it being psychosis

1821
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:21,792
I lived in for the last 2 years

1822
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:29,216
I think that I feel rust good

1823
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:35,104
As we as we go along

1824
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:36,128
Elizabeth

1825
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:39,200
Yeah absolutely I have missed

1826
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:45,600
After after being fired and then

1827
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:48,928
Going on vacation and not having any

1828
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:52,768
It's been literally I used to work everyday

1829
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:59,424
8 a.m. until 2 a.m.

1830
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:05,824
He's written a lot of all work and no play makes Jack a Dull Boy

1831
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:12,224
Mostly

1832
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:18,624
