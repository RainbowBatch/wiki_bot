1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody outside and Dad talked a little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
We are damn Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,960
We're all having a rough go so let me ask you a question is it about The Witcher

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,848
I started to play the card game

10
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,920
I do like the diversity of things to

11
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,784
To do in the game especially that that that is such an extreme example

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
Game inside the game

13
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Really good

14
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,208
I was just saying a happy thought

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
St Pat's

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
Because here we are recording on Saint Pat

17
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,352
That's it that's an interesting question I don't know

18
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
I don't really remember Saint Patrick's day is finally

19
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
Childhood years it was just like a thing that you know maybe you don't go to school

20
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
And then as I got older it was

21
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Just an excuse to drink

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Cancel

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
You f****** bread

24
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Yeah

25
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:05,696
The same time I was doing that almost every other day to it wasn't like

26
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
My early twenties of late teens it wasn't like a

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
You didn't need a reason it reminds me of a Paula Tompkins

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,008
I don't remember that it's Saint Patrick's Day mainly because

29
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
For me

30
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Any old day could be Saint Patrick

31
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
Noon

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
Especially whenever I've driven out of

33
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,016
Yeah it wasn't today wasn't something that you know I'm not

34
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
I think I might be a little bit

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
It's a least one of my grandparents adopt

36
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
Then we don't really know a whole lot of family lineage

37
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,304
But I understand there may be a little bit but I can't really

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
They claim that

39
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,144
As being something really important

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
Specific

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
60 Patrick's memory was what

42
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Groupon

43
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,336
But my office was right over the the river

44
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Downtown

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
Chicago that's amazing view of them dying the river green

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Viet dispersing and like you could see it be

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Coming

48
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Celebration

49
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
Saint Patrick's Day

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
They're becoming is very

51
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,072
And then a couple days later you know walking around Viking Wrigleyville and just seeing

52
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
The trash

53
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
The other side of the

54
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Grace

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,336
Absolutely

56
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Do Jordan today we have in it

57
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Episode to go over

58
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Before we get down to that

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Thank you

60
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
Sporting show

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,088
So first of all Michael thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
I'm a policy wonk

63
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,792
Next 2813308004 thank you so much you are now if I was you on

64
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
I'm a policy wonk

65
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
Normally I wouldn't normally I would have said no it's a reference to a song

66
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,312
Otherwise I would not have the phone number on the show

67
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,152
It's a rap song

68
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
NextBus

69
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,808
Yes thank you so much you're an alcoholic

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,880
Nextag thank you so much and I'll probably walk

71
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
Text Chris

72
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Thank you so much

73
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Conspiracy grows

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
I'm a policy wonk

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Thank you

76
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Text Rosemary that goes I'm not sure now.

77
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
I'm a policy wonk

78
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
Are you very much Rosemary as well as

79
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
Donated on elevated level

80
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
Thank you so much you are now a technocrat

81
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
And the video thank you so much you are now attacking

82
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Regret

83
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Heroin

84
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
So good

85
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
Freakishly large

86
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
Thank you so much Kelly and thank you so much video

87
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,407
Do it like this

88
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Does Brookshire weird

89
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Appreciate it thank you very much

90
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,319
Jordan today where I'm in the world is going a little bit

91
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,415
How to control there's a lot of various ways you could

92
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
Describe it I think tensions are in

93
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,815
Incredibly High I think that there's a lot of trouble

94
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:29,215
But I don't know how to I don't know how to put this well

95
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,055
It's it's the most uncertain I think I've ever felt

96
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
I I think

97
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,431
So 24me unprecedented on many levels

98
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
The uncertainty surrounding

99
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
View at the house

100
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Situation

101
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
In the country and all of it

102
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
The f****** world

103
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
In a situation like this

104
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
I don't

105
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
Want to talk about Alex

106
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
No I don't really want to I tweet

107
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Did Arthur episode on Monday

108
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
They covered a lot of these solidify

109
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Location of his

110
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
Conspiracies around the virus

111
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Sans IV the outbreak

112
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,311
And I don't really have a whole lot of faith that it's going

113
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Grow much

114
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
From there yet

115
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
That's doubtful

116
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
You ain't seen his own personal struggles

117
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Bleeding into his show in a way that makes him incapable of covering it

118
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,903
I don't know I haven't actually listen to Like Mondays episode but I don't

119
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,583
It's going to be anything really all that interesting cover

120
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
Either we would be spinning our wheels and I don't know if that's necessarily a great thing

121
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Things to do

122
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
And I feel like

123
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
In this climate of

124
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,871
I like there's a lot of information and I think that people should be getting that in

125
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
A better Source has been

126
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
In terms of health information what you should do

127
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
What's what's best

128
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:52,159
Practices I think there are tons of other outlets and I don't think that we can fill that hole absolute

129
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
Where is I would love to be able to be the show that does literally everything

130
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Now what we can do

131
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Jordan I find myself

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
And situation where

133
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,031
It's just a real bummer it is I don't know exactly what to do

134
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
There's a lot going on

135
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
And it's scary time for a lot of people

136
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,919
You're going through this unprecedented Health crisis

137
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Any question of what

138
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Going to happen

139
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Is it impossible for

140
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
No clue

141
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
I feel like in times like this listen

142
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
To Alex and talking about is bulshit isn't the highest

143
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Priority

144
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
He's going to do what he does

145
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
Pandora next episode we can get back to

146
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
Paying attention to that

147
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
But in this time

148
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
I think a lot of people you know their self quarantine again

149
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Stress is really high

150
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
So maybe the best thing we can do is

151
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Providing the sky

152
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
An amusing Escape

153
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
From the prison

154
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
In order to do this though I'm going to need to perform a magical rich

155
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
I need everyone to

156
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Close their eyes

157
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
All of you listen

158
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
Jordan you included

159
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Unless you're driving don't do that then

160
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
But close your eyes and take a deep breath

161
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Breathing

162
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Breathe out

163
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Breathe in

164
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Breathe out

165
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,023
Feel your breath taking you to a simpler time a simpler place

166
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
That sound you hear

167
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
Is that a breeze rustling a palm tree

168
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,935
Is that a songbird fluttering right outside the window

169
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
It feels so familiar

170
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
What is that sound

171
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,015
I know it's alright let's do that

172
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
So we got ourselves.

173
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,719
I felt like baby the best use of our time would be to do another episode about Lionel

174
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
If

175
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Disney Junior

176
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,607
Subway now he's still going to be bitching about people

177
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,263
F****** backpacks on this goddamn Subway's I will say that I went I was going through a lot of his back Kat

178
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,103
I found that there is a lot more episodes about backpack

179
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
Complaints about it cover

180
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
People having backpacks on the subway

181
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,903
So in case anybody out there has not hurt the other Lionel episodes

182
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
What is a gentleman who

183
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
Used to be a pretty regular Gaston Alex's show

184
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
He is a former lawyer

185
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
I'm a beast

186
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887

Of course you really did not like cruise ships

241
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103

Here is Lionel complaining about cruise ships

244
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,375
The story about the tragedy involving the

245
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,703
Stricken Italian cruise liner reminded me of

246
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Forget

247
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Let me see if I can get through this

248
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591

My wife and I been on our share radio and work-related pain promotional deals

And the only thing worse than going on a cruise

259
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
Is that being able to hide

260
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Because you're obligated to a meet-and-greet

261
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
And you can't escape

262
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
You want to prison

273
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583

Look I need to I need to pause here

283
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
I can't tell if this is self-deprecate

284
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
I've no idea because Lionel already established that he's been on these Cruise as much as a media affairs

285
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
He is leader paper do the cruise ships look how could you how could you beat all this

286
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
Complaining about how anything

287
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
Appears to be entertained on a cruise ship

288
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
He is entertainment on a cruise ship they will do anything including listening to Lytle talk

289
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Understand

290
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
I really can't

291
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
Figure out if that's trying to be self-effacing or not but

292
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Okay alright

293
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Because yes

294
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183

00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Entertainment

297
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Not good enough for cruises

298
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Imagine the horror of that

299
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
I do imagine that

300
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
And around

Hanging out of you

341
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
I'd rather lick a bar rag

342
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
Then go on another Cruise

343
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,831

354
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
Millennials are so terrible they're the worst people they complain about the smallish it anyways I'm rich enough

355
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
And popular enough to go on cruise

356
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
People pay me to go on

357
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
The food bad

358
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
Aldi

359
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,935
Oh my God

360
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
I'm so frustrated by the piece

361
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
People laughing at

362
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Like I don't know where the B

363
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567

364
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
I think that some of that is uncomfortable laugh

365
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759
A lot of the laughter was at the rather suck a hospital mom

366
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Coronavirus

367
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551

Mostly Hospital

370
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:34,047
Bar rag the problem with that from a structural standpoint if you're writing a bit is that licking

371
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
A bar rag is less

372
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Disgusting

373
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,935
Been sucking the hospital. You have to flip those two

374
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
Has to work at least as a little alcohol

375
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,311
Squatting over a bear trap is a good third one

376
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,407
Cuz that causes like bodily harm and what have you but

377
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Backwards then forwards

378
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
In terms of the

379
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
The rule of Threes there at the end

380
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
That's a failure

381
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Alphabet

382
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,743
So even if you're trying to do this hockey nonsense at least do it like with a little bit of joke structure

383
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
I'm at my notes.

384
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,655
You said, does he

385
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
I've been with enough Road

386
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Text to know that if

387
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Just get the rule of three

388
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
You can do fine

389
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
Yeah it's it's less disoriented you at least

390
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Do I have the progression

391
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Correct solutely

392
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
So Lionel in this next piece

393
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,271
It's found some news that you next

394
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,159
I like that I think is a little bit different from structural perspective from our show because these are a little bit longer than most

395
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,255
The clips of Alex someone trying to be funny

396
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Where is Water Valley

397
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Discomforting

398
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Very upsetting dispatches

399
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
From the lower upper class

400
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Yeah that's what the

401
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,519
Lionel here has found some new stories that he thinks

402
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Are funny

403
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
So he's going

404
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
To cover these stories

405
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,199
Lennar funny see what Patty bulshit this year

406
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
I think this might be the

407
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
This is these are not funny

408
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,327
Just a headlight

409
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,887
Headlines ma'am

410
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Watching Sparky

411
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Space

412
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
New stories that are so great

413
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Just in terms of their facts

414
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Structure in fragments

415
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
That's for tonight

416
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
Pieces about it I don't trust you with my Graphics thank you because

417
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Disgrace

418
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
And I've got three for you tonight now first please

419
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
The stories are not

420
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,631
Funny I in no way want to create the impression that I'm mocking anyway okay

421
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,215
Then don't do this

422
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
All right y'all ready you you give him the

423
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
Like the point where this is

424
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Fluoride in conception

425
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,247
You're talking about funny headlines. I'm not trying to make

426
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Make fun of these stories

427
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,599
Alright

428
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
Joe neuberger had her for Monk

429
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
Do you seize by state wildlife officials

430
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
Burger who.im not Burger

431
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,655
Claim has a form of autism claims The Chimps are

432
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Service monkey

433
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Here's where it gets interesting

434
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
It seems that said State officials were

435
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
Different claims as to the chimp

436
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Statuses

437
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Service monkeys

438
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
Because they were dressed in pirate

439
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
She was also

440
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Decked Out

441
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
A Buccaneer togs

442
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
And charge

443
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
2buckz

444
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
For a picture with her and her

445
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
Swashbuckler primates

446
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Your service monkey

447
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
What you charge $2

448
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
I want they want to take a picture what can I do I can't stop them

449
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
This

450
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Is what I meant

451
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
The usual pirate pun okay

452
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
But I'm not ardmediathek.de

453
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
Justify

454
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,615
So this first story here is about a woman having some monkeys that you dressed up like Pirates

455
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
There's no joke in Lionel segmented bypass he just thinks

456
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,271
The very existence of this story is enough to be f****** hilarious

457
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,135
There's no need to do any more work monkey Pirates it's time to go to lunch

458
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
Don't even bother with the

459
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Slightest of pun

460
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:20,863
You kind of accentuate you do the joke where it's like I would do this joke and that's supposed to be the joke that's Para

461
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
There is an explanation for the story

462
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
The monkeys were dressed like Pirates

463
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
Because it was New Orleans

464
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
During Mardi Gras

465
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Also there's

466
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,407
Much more to the story that Lionel could have riffed on if you cared at all

467
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
So this is a piece from 2011

468
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,807
But if I do any work Pastor letting a headline be a joke

469
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
He could have found that this woman

470
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
Had one of her monkeys stolen

471
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
In 2007

472
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Years prior

473
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Who works on exotic

474
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Pet store

475
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,119
Inform at allegedly came into the store and

476
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
Stole her monkey friend that was Named Destiny

477
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:01,055
The explanation for them being serviced monkeys as spelled out in an article from News 4 Jacksonville about this that

478
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
Where she says that she has seizures

479
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
And the monkeys are trained to help her in that

480
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Situation

481
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,479
Whether or not that's true that is the explanation

482
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,343
An article in the Florida Times-Union points out that the store was the victim of a number of pet that

483
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
In a short span of time

484
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,768
A police major told them quote it was the second time in six months that this type of monkey was stolen from that busy

485
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
The store owners also found a leopard gecko kingsnake and ball python missing around the same time presumably stolen

486
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Okay alright

487
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Okay

488
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,336
People stealing monkeys robotics alright okay

489
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
Struggling older woman who has the monkeys who may or may not be trained to how

490
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Helper in the event of a seizure

491
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
One of her monkeys was stolen

492
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,112
What a few years prior to having them taken in 2011 is

493
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,000
Probably re-traumatizing for her but then on the other side of this which is

494
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
The situation in July 2011 this woman was convicted of Cruelty to monkeys over this

495
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
That's trouble she didn't have permits to have the monkeys they're being used to street performers an issue Department of Wildlife and Fisheries

496
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
A spokesman said quote the monkeys were in

497
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Import Health overall

498
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
With a diaper rash dehydration in

499
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Piercing

500
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,808
There's a larger story here cuz they're Pirates

501
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
I got it what the diaper rash

502
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
Who is the larger story that on the one side deals with an unwell person who has a

503
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
The connection with these monkeys and on some emotional level probably does need them

504
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
On the other

505
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
And it also has a story that clearly deals with animals

506
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:38,592
Abuse both of these are serious issues headline about a crazy lady dresses monkeys up like

507
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
That's wild

508
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Who's the best service

509
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
The story there was a

510
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
Rash of

511
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Exotic animal theft

512
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Yeah

513
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,856
That spray that was in 2007

514
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Did they find her

515
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
I couldn't tell from the news reporting

516
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
I think

517
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Did they move to Atlanta and you know where she

518
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
She's working she was a big fan of 2 Chainz all right

519
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
Magic City

520
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
I don't know I couldn't tell from the

521
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
The stories

522
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
That what happened

523
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Became of Destin

524
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,336
It appears that maybe she got another monkey friend

525
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Alright anyways

526
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
He's not done

527
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
Are the premise of the story marinate with your neck

528
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
This is just a great headline

529
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,112
News in Pennsylvania

530
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,208

Neither do I

536
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,224
Yeah

537
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
What's a boob

538
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Why the f***

539
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:59,744
So this is a story about a man named Ronald heichel who is romantically involved with a woman named mirinda boob

540
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
Problem was Miranda was married to Samuel

541
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,400
In order to take care of that inconvenience mirinda and Ronald decided to

542
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
The murder Samuel

543
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,752
And then Ronald paid Kermit butts $5,000 to help

544
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
Dispose of the body

545
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:16,640
Is a pretty f****** serious story was the murderer in all but the funny

546
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
This is so fascinating to me because I'm the one hand Lionel tries to play this game where he is 100 synonyms for every word he uses

547
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,088
Sound like a smart ass f****** dude in the world

548
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
The humor of a

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
Out of China

559
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
The headline read

560
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
I swear to God

561
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,808
A happy ending to Farmers anus woes

562
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Let me just read part of the

563
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
The first sentence from the story okay quote

564
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
A farmer from ju county of

565
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
Who made Providence

566
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
Has live 55 years without an anus

567
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,424
Habersham reason she comes to mind I know it's not what you think

568
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,008
Why wait wait wait

569
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
Nobody talks about the Ouija

570
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
Do you know anyone in giu County

571
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:29,088
A special hello and a howdy-do when I get well soon to my favorite farmer with the

572
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
Hope you get better

573
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
So there you have it

574
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
Thank God for the internet and I have these stories link

575
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,560
In their entirety on my pixel Evan blog comment

576
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
If you're bored out of your mind

577
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:47,520
That took a dark turn out to be clear also when he says referring to the weatherman

578
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
Traffic

579
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
That's confusing now

580
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,968
Flip stories f****** horrifying

581
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,296
About 55 year-old Chinese farmer was bored of the

582
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,856
Congenital condition that left it without an anal open

583
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
Without getting too graphic

584
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,744
Epic prior to 2011 he had a surgical hole that he could use to s*** but he also had

585
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
Extruded manual

586
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,400
According to an article in pediatric clinical advisor there there's some degree of

587
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
Perforated anus in approximately one in five thousand

588
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Live birth

589
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,056
But you can imagine this is usually not too big of a deal

590
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:26,176
For people with better health coverage pretty immediately upon

591
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
But it could be horrible for someone like a farmer living in

592
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Absolutely

593
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
This story is just

594
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,904
Haha this guy didn't have a butthole to Lionel believe that you probably

595
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,512
It's like really edgy comedy stuff like he's out there working Blue Man

596
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,888
I never imagined missing Jay Leno

597
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
If you're going to read headlines

598
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
UCSF

599
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
I think that he thinks

600
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,080
He's kind of like a hipper

601
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,152
Edgier Andy Rooney

602
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
I believe that

603
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
I believe that

604
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
The kids man

605
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
Divers have a butthole

606
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
Bored

607
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Tragic

608
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,488
Reality but that guy lives with yeah this is just

609
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
Is Lytle mocking people with shity or lives that have the headline really should be like awareness that this is

610
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Congenital condition

611
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,544
Exist

612
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
Choose your words better

613
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,736
Oh God damn it so that really wasn't it

614
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
Lionel is a mess

615
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
It would be wrong of

616
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
To sit here and say that

617
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
He is wrong about everything or doesn't have some good

618
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
Generally

619
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,936
B2B variant support of lgbtq Rights

620
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
Very in favor of legalizing sex work

621
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
He has some

622
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,360
Pretty decent Cosmopolitan ideas

623
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
And his next trip I got to say

624
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
I find no fault

625
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
Then this one take that he has

626
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,000
Why do we have presidential debates

627
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Seriously

628
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
Have you ever heard something candidates

629
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,888
Something about anything that made you say

630
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
I think I look for that guy or gal

631
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
Yes

632
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
But that answer just now

633
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
That changes every

634
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,896
I'll save you the type no

635
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
If you like a cat

636
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,248
You'll love her debate performance if you hate

637
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
Someone shorter than the cure for

638
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:47,488
Real quick this is part I agree with now think that's a bad take a lot of color suede by

639
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Wow

640
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
Can't say what it is

641
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Bigot

642
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,216
Now if I had my druthers then I'm not so sure what druthers even are

643
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
Cool

644
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
Have you ever heard before

645
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Of course I do

646
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
What

647
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
I had my

648
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
Here's how I do debate

649
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Big the GOP snoozefest

650
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,808
One solid hour before the actual

651
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Everybody Gibbons is drinking I mean hardcore

652
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,952
Alright he's playing me with this one

653
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Then

654
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Ties at half mast

655
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Hair messed up

656
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
Cigarette dangling from your lips

657
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Maybe an eyelid droop

658
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
We're just learned but the truth

659
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Pours out

660
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
And exudes like a

661
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Michele Bachmann today look

00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,248
Run hour

666
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
By the way for guys in Brooklyn

667
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,672
You think I like being me I know I know I'm bored

668
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,488
And I'm sick of the Romney jokes

669
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Perry

670
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
A triplane cowpoke 24/7

671
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,376
Quiet business it's hard

672
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Grandpa

Look at me

674
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,008
Secretly keep calling me a nut

675
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
I want to follow the Constitution

676
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
And they called me at 9

677
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:12,480
Wait that's what Ross

00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
Need to get out of the country inn

679
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
It's bad for an amateur

680
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
He's just doing front

681
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
A psychiatrist

682
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
I'm crazy in the coconut

683
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,328
Unbelievable but that's your image of what Ron Paul would be like drunk

684
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,632
We talkin about how you tried to

685
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,448

Because of all the times people have permit

697
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Why

698
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Note

699
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Imelda

Comet

That is you

710
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,368
I like the idea of coming on to your platform and being like presidential debates

711
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Fish beef

712
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
Conversation I think is

713
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
As room for that

714
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
Like

715
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
You floated

716
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
However as a comedy bit

717
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,568
Those are bad examples of what these candidates would say when they're drunk

718
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
Newt gingrich's just saying he's fat

719
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:52,576
Newt Gingrich is like I'm trying to get another wife right now I'm hot you can do better

720
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,672
Michele Bachmann is like I can see

721
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
Either side of my head but not straight

722
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,536
Final vote Tuesday to go with your drunk

723
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
You know they say they write drunk edit sober

724
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Take a note take a note

725
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:12,800
Yep

726
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
And see what they would say if they were in your position

727
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
See now I'm going to I'm going to take his wake up in the morning

728
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,296
Polish it up a little bit on TV

729
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
Remove some prepositions shirt

730
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,160
Flowers for re-election

731
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Do I go with the hard-r

732
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Goodbye.

733
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,192
Okay so I'll take this idea all approved

734
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,800
Did you ever do there was a show out in the northwest suburbs where

735
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
They would get you a hotel

736
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
And you would do the first

737
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Completely drunk

738
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
In the meantime I'd heard of that but I've not the guy that that is the perfect

739
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
Format for a debate

740
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
That would be interesting

741
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,536
I really I think those kind of shows are really irresponsible

742
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,864
I probably while I was doing stand-up would have done it

743
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
If asked

744
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:14,240
But I'm glad I didn't

745
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:20,128
I can't lie and say that I was sober every time I stand up

746
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Absolutely

747
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,272
Yeah I don't know I did this is close to like

748
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
Alright

749
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,928
GPS doesn't work out

750
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
But yeah

751
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
You should die

752
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Head back to the

753
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,584
So I'll say this relying on that last click he had a point and he made it

754
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
And that is the piece that needs to be better if everyone is

755
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
The message is

756
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Yeah

757
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
Now I think

758
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
I thought I stumbled into

759
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
Do a couple of these these missives

760
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
F****** synonyms

761
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
Bet these couples

762
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
Yeah it's not bad

763
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
These next couple are muddy

764
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,744
I don't know what the point of the month

765
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
I want you to update from now on or we start these

766
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,144
I want you to try and guess what they're going to be about

767
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,704
Let's see this one we're talking

768
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,568
In 2011/12 tall of this is from the 2011/2012 win

769
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
You was gone from the station by about 2

770
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
2014

771
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Started doing like

772
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
Overly long boring

773
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Going to cover those

774
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
I mean

775
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
2011

776
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
We got to go with Obama

777
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
This one's got to be about

778
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Right

779
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
It's not

780
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,472
My friends

781
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,544
I'd like to discuss something with you one of the best

782
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
Human Endeavors in fact

783
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
What makes us different and separate into

784
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Distinct from the other animals

785
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
The pyramids are ability

786
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
We winning

787
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Penguin

788
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Pot of gold

789
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Train

790
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
And you know what

791
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
Vibes that vehicle

792
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
Mega Millions Lotto ticket

793
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Take a chance

794
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Snipped whatever

795
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
So you're listening at this point you thinking always going to take the piss out of the lottery he's going to go after these either either

796
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,128
Either the exploitative nature of the lottery the dumb dumb

797
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Supai Lottery

798
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,456
I could go either way

799
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
The punch down

800
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Kratom benefits

801
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
This is best at this point

802
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,208
No idea where this is going

803
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
The cruises

804
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
It's your ticket to a dream

805
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Nothing but exemplifies this

806
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
And the offer

807
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
Seaworks

808
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
That's one example.

809
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Sensible of the group

810
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,056
Perhaps a tad Daft and dreaming

811
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Decides that for reasons that

812
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
I can't quite Wrecking

813
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
Fathom

814
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
Give me a lottery jackpot

815
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
Significant enough to warrant

816
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
Pulling his

817
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
Coworkers harder

818
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Shekels to buy a series of

819
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Buechel fund of

820
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,696
He's mad about office pools for lottery

821
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,536
Borderline antisocial

822
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
But also he seems to be

823
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Bike

824
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
This is

825
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
Kind of dumb

826
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,240
Nothing exemplifies this. This Dominus

827
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
I mean I guess

828
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:32,128
It feels like a negative how does he feel about March Madness bracket

829
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,456
She doesn't bring it up like

830
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,320
Point to like this this fool the simpleton who believes in that has all this hope he's

831
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,648
Play pointing to the guy working the board behind him

832
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,512
When you see like what do you hear laughter it's often because he's

833
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Gesturing

834
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
To the the room

835
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
Alright

836
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
Hey guys let's just do a fun things

837
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,264
Together and we'll just eat that nobody wants to win but it'll be

838
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,592
Technical employee

839
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
The station

840
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
Habitual find a tendon

841
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Find or derivative

842
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,832
White-eyed delusional and frankly insane Alpha member of the psych ward

843
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
Collect everyone's dollarin

844
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
Buy the series of

845
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
The photocopies.

846
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,048
He realizes them somehow he provides weird notation

847
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Have you been

848
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Childish

849
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Psychotic

850
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
Scroll that an FBI profiler

851
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Serial killer

852
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
I thought he had his dream

853
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,568
Sweet dreams

854
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
I'd hope

855
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
And pray

856
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
And wish

857
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
When

858
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
Divide 81

859
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Money

860
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
Cats and say I'm a winner

861
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
I do look at this poor example of genetics run-amok

862
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,928
Slightest idea math probability or anything approximating

863
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
And you know

864
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Knowing your heart

865
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
Manchild ever win

866
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
He certainly would be that Lottery victim

867
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,728
That pathetic Orchard

868
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Mountain bikes

869
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
Pastime

870
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,592
German p*** but I say

871
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
I say let a man dream

872
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
But I'm groveling delusion so what

873
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,784
Way to pull off this now you're fine with confidence

874
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,600
Deliberately cobbled image of cool collected and together

875
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,904
Shut the main drain that noted

876
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,232
Better place for Charles Manson once noted as follows

877
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,048
Look down at me and you see a fool

878
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Look up

879
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
And you said God

880
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
Looks traded me

881
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,912
And you see yourself

882
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
What does that have to do with anything

883
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
I haven't the foggiest idea

884
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
Of what that has to do with country what this

885
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
Brief

886
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Winning

887
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
I'll bring something

888
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Just one

889
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
For one moment

890
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,624
But the man

891
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
Dream

892
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
As you see fit

893
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,512
This is the kind of

894
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
Ginkgo are

895
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
You know like milk from a

896
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
From a standpoint of like what is

897
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Is he saying it's like

898
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
He's abusing this guy is being crazy

899
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,848
At the beginning and like this is like all right

900
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
The point turn

901
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,968
Turns into let them Andre genetically inferior just

902
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
It's very strange

903
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
Picture how to decipher

904
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
AC Pro or against

905
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Help

906
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
The end is definitely for it but it's

907
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Is it stupid

908
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:32,864
Maybe it's just sort of thing or it's like the dumb raffle the crowd the rebel

909
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Terrorize

910
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
Let them have their exactly I get paid to be on cruise ship

911
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,616
Let them have their stupid dreams of office poop

912
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,944
You just mad that no one invited him to the office.

913
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
There's one of those

914
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,832
Personal storage

915
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,904
Absolute mad at a guy

916
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
Generally speaking his topics

917
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
Might as well be like he looks over his balcony in his like

918
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,840
What's a billboard say I'll be bitching about that

919
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,912
But this is this does feel like there's a guy evolved

920
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,984
Yeah two important points one the German pornography thing

921
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,312
Is a running gag that's why everyone laughed at

922
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:19,712
He always right whenever you bring the pornography references German pornography

923
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,552
The second thing is that Charles Manson thing I think is actually the closest

924
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
He gets to like being pretty absurdist funny

925
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,696
It has nothing to do with what he's talking about

926
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,512
And the way he calls himself out for like

927
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
Nothing

928
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
Nuggets

929
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
It's close to work

930
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
But because of these surrounding to

931
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,728
Confusion about what the guy I think that it fails

932
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
I I think maybe my big ass

933
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
Issue here is

934
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
His complete and utter lack of

935
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Timing wedding

936
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
He slows down

937
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,176
Yeah like he can get the ranch

938
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,272
Timing pretty well but once he starts trying to hit the the punchline

939
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
He wants a

940
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
F****** up

941
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,624
That is a problem now that. Just like

942
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,744
Charles Manson noted philosopher Charles Manson once noted

943
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
And then

944
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,840
It's terrible to go do some reps at open mic

945
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
Absolutely

946
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:15,008
Get some of this worked out workout there 5 at some shows long before they show up on The Tonight Show or anything like

947
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,080
Like that come on man workout your workout your five

948
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
My friend this is not the

949
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
The Tonight Show

950
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,248
So I thought was a little bit confusing a little bit muddy

951
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
What is actual point is

952
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,856
I think his next one is another example that what do you think is about

953
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,184
Let's see well we just had

954
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Office pool

955
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
You bet

956
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,864
The genetically inferior getting everybody in the office

957
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,264
To give them $1 very important pressing issue in American culture

958
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
It's got to be back

959
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Gabby backpack

960
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,151
That's a good guess but I will say that I didn't

961
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
Include any further

962
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
This week A friend of mine

963
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
What showing a young lady in her 20s

964
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
About 40 years ago

965
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
And he handed her the yellow

966
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
Photos

967
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
I can't handle bone-forming

968
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
And it hit me

969
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
She never held

970
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
Snapshot

971
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Photos

972
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Never before

Rare

980
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
She knew nothing of

981
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
Polaroid Kodak

982
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Kodachrome

983
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
One hour photo

984
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
I want chocolate

985
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Home movies

986
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,839
The right now you can tell that the setup is

987
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,935
Kids these days exactly

988
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239

00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,127
EB the johnra of these kids don't know anything about XYZ thing

990
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:00,991
They don't know about chasing the hoop down the road with a stick

991
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,343
Never worked in the coal mine

992
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
Jose's no way

993
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
Sounds like

994
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
Was when she asked

995
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
When were these photos taken

996
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
How old were they

997
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
And I said well

998
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Turn the photo of

999
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
It was a printed Mountaineer

1000
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
She never seen

1001
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935

00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
You photos back

00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
And every now and then threw something

1004
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,055
Snafu

1005
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
You get the wrong patch

1006
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
I just Romo

1007
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
Gordy's Fayetteville

1008
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,479
How to remember taking these photos

1009
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
Who are they

1010
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Remember

1011
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Before when

1012
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Photo books

1013
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Chloroplast

1014
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Black almost

1015
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
Paper albums and you glue in his room

1016
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Triangles to hold

1017
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
The pictures and play

1018
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Same pictures

1019
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
And now the bike

1020
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
Theoretically

1021
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
On a phone or computer

1022
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Where's Creighton

1023
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Why

1024
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Because it's

1025
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
Butter today that's

1026
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Comet

1027
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
As juicy

1028
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
I don't know what the point is this

1029
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Wait

1030
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Okay

1031
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
All right so is

1032
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
His point is

1033
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
Look at these

1034
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
He's dumb dumb young kids

1035
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
Who don't know what a Snapchat is

1036
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,999
Don't have a Polaroid in their in their bones

1037
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
And

1038
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Cool

1039
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,583
Well it's great it's

1040
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,215
Try to set up as this like if you kids don't know from photographs

1041
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Kids

1042
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
Vanellope and it's like

1043
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Because it's better

1044
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Yeah

1045
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
I mean this is

1046
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
I mean yeah

1047
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,735
This is maybe a trade observation

1048
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:42,623
These kids don't know anything about photographs and a good

1049
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,719
Okay alright

1050
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,583
Alright thanks for signing off on iPhone wide open

1051
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
The TV used to turn off

1052
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,423
9 p.m. and there was nothing

1053
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
Until 6 a.m.

1054
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
Bad

1055
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,639
Now I appreciate late-night infomercial it's like the whole message

1056
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
It is

1057
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
You know

1058
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,015
I haven't people remember and having a Avoca

1059
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
Images of this bygone time

1060
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
That sucks

1061
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Hours putting

1062
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Looking at the

1063
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
The same photograph wondering

1064
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Who are they

1065
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,607
And now I don't have to do that

1066
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Weird

1067
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:31,007
I think baby that's an example of Lionel subverting the form

1068
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,823
B b like it's poorly done

1069
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
But you can't just

1070
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,223
Throw the twist there in the last second

1071
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,039
Of the of the

1072
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,343
You kind of need to earn it a little more ripe

1073
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
Overall Edge n***** pork

1074
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Pennywise

1075
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
This next clip yard

1076
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
Misses epistle letter

1077
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Post

1078
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Report

1079
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
I'm out

1080
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
The next one what you think

1081
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
You going to be about

1082
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
Okay

1083
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
See

1084
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,847
Young people again what are young people

1085
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Destroying

1086
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,711
It's about IPA

1087
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
The beer

1088
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
Snow out there is not

1089
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
It's actually about

1090
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,671
It's about how there's a rash

1091
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Stupidity

1092
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,975
That is a

1093
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
Going around the country

1094
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:36,799
I'd like to address the topic that isn't

1095
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,871
Ever discussed it's a condition that someone you know

1096
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Suffers from

1097
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,223
There's no cure the diagnosis can be tricky it's called

1098
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Stupid

1099
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
No one talks about

1100
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,647
Stupid it's not that we don't have a long

1101
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Standing

1102
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
Series of

1103
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
Aphorism

1104
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,815
About how stupid people cannot be cured

1105
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Well

1106
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
He seems to be like trying to

1107
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Set this

1108
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Stop with a

1109
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,031
Like hey no one talks about how some people are dumb

1110
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,895
The quiet problem again I would say go to another disabuse yourself of that notion

1111
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,175
Pretty quick

1112
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
The heartbreaks

1113
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:21,087
The pain of stupid is responsible for more lost jobs and lost opportunities than you can imagine

1114
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
It's wrecked political careers

1115
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Marriages

1116
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,207
Costas Country Village

1117
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,815
Use of dollars in Lost productivity more than any other individual pathology Factor

1118
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,167
There isn't a person or family today who hasn't been personally touched by

1119
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Stupid

1120
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:41,823
Four years medical Sciences both failed and refused to address and quantify this sometimes deadly diagnosis

1121
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
Stupid I refer to is

1122
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,967
Uncontaminated by either a substance abuse or sexual component

1123
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
Hey Brett Favre

1124
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,807
Penchant for obscene s****** and Ally

1125
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
Is he stupid

1126
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Yes

1127
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
But there's a c

1128
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,183
Sexual component involved which renders

1129
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,743
Megaman completely devoid of any rational thought

1130
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Potentiate

1131
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Stupid like

Barb was motivated by

1136
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
You know

1137
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,311
Weird men aren't responsible

1138
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,199
Boehner aspects to it then it's not stupid stupid stupid

1139
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,503
The stupid that he's talking about

1140
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,527
You've made that clarification

1141
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
He missed

1142
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,319
The easiest

1143
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
You missed the

1144
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,487
Easiest joke that everybody is had a family member who does it and then the obvious joke there is

1145
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
If you don't know who it is

1146
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
It's you

1147
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:40,447
Line on I-30

1148
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,055
But don't pure and authentic stupid is different

1149
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,871
Stupid enjoy the singularity on the boneheaded

1150
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
Spectrum

1151
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,223
Uncontaminated by any other Factor

1152
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
Chemical emotional or homeowner

1153
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Case in point

1154
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,903
Navy Captain owenby honors who enjoys the honor

Homophobic

1157
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,679
And inappropriate videos when he was their ship's executive officer translation

1158
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
He was stupid

1159
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
Yeah it wasn't drunk Jairo she did it for the heck of it on his own in a strict military regime

1160
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,175
But doesn't Brook any of this nonsense

1161
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:26,783
A man who clawed his way up the career ladder whose wartime command is pure gold

1162
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,111
He gave it up for no reason whatsoever

1163
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
Edward Mason

1164
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671

Camera

1169
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,399
There's also the similarity of the case of General Stanley McChrystal

1170
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,679
Who on his own

1171
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,007
No particular reason disparages commander-in-chief in

1172
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031

Medication will help anyone at any time

If you were someone you loved

1182
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,863
Suffering from the Heartbreak of stupid there's no known cure

1183
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
No medication no treatment

1184
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:21,567
And don't be misled by milder forms of the disease foolish idiotic as a seemingly ubiquitous damn

1185

64 giacobello case was stupid

1189
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
You know it

1190
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
When you see it

1191
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Comment

1192
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Accordingly

1193
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
So

1194
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
I don't understand

1195
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,535
Because the parameters as they were set up in the Brett Favre stupidity doesn't count cuz you was horny

1196
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
Right so horny stupid doesn't

1197
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
That's stupid

1198
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Stupid

1199
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,495
Jets versus the example that used Owen honors

1200
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,823
Like I was a Navy Captain until he got in trouble for those defensive videos

1201
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
Cuz he was filming while he's on board his ship

1202
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,943
The reason this should qualify as pure stupidity

1203
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,015
Is because otters wasn't just making those videos for fun

1204
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,831
He was screaming them on Saturday nights for the crew

1205
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,159
In the same way that far ahead of secondary motivation to his action

1206
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
Namely being horny

1207
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Soda Donner

1208
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,815
He was driven by a desire for attention and some poor with localized celebrity on the ship

1209
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,399
Is obviously doesn't meet the standard line was established for the store

1210
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
Report supposed to be about

1211
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,519
The situation with General McChrystal was rolling

1212
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,055
Stone Peace by Michael Hastings

1213
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,359
Wearable Crystal and his staff talked bunch of s***

1214
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,943
Maybe this is closer to an example of just regular stupid

1215
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,223
But I don't know if I would say

1216
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
Speaking to a journalist

1217
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
Quickly that's really stupid

1218
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
This seems like you know

1219
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,879
The problem isn't what

1220
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,183
Crystal said it's so I'll be

1221
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975

Stan

1224
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:49,887
Give me the Beasley only two examples Lionel gives about this rash of stupidity he's worried about

1225
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,983
It seems like maybe he was trying to talk about a lack of discipline in the military

1226
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Connect

1227
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,895
Please do examples of military people who got out of pocket

1228
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,943
Boggles my mind

1229
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Just because his

1230
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Problem with

1231
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Honors

1232
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,807
Seems less about

1233
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
The massive homophobia

1234
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
And more

1235
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
About that he recorded

1236
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:19,327
Or with diagram giving you my peace

1237
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,143
Is more correct or incorrect it's that he told somebody

1238
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
Military discipline

1239
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,775
Keep your house in order otherwise you're stupid

1240
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:34,431
I don't think the military discipline is stupid

1241
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:39,807
I think he's trying to Trojan Horse a complaint about military people not following orders and being like

1242
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:46,207
Really regimented and all that stupid

1243
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
Stupid and I

1244
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
Two examples both of them

1245
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,559
Exactly the same

1246
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Not bad

1247
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,119
That clip

1248
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
That report

1249
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,679
Is really weird

1250
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,215
To hear

1251
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
Particularly after you hear this

1252
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,247
If you think for a minute

1253
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:13,855
Direct Perry's disastrous performance Wednesday night is going to affect

1254
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,927
His chances of cinching the GOP nomination

1255
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,207
You're out of your mind

1256
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,279
Listen to Republic

1257
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
Let me be brutal

1258
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,375
The GOP and Republicans have

1259
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,167
Some kind of immunity against

1260
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
Before you think I'm being partisan

1261
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
Perish the thought

1262
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
Let me remind you that the Democrats were nuts

1263
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,871
Over-the-counter

1264
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
Pended Obama

1265
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,967
Whose campaign transmission never got out of Hope and change

1266
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,759
They love what they perceive as

1267
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Smart

1268
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
No message

1269
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
But Republic

1270
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
La Bonita

1271
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,903
Any Republican says

1272
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,695
No matter how he says it

1273
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
So long as it matches lowering taxes

1274
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,327
I bet his eyes lovingly over the image and myth of Reagan

1275
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,399
Vegan dispute Evolution darwinian mechanics

1276
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,423
Gravity

1277
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,727
He can't believe in intelligent design

1278
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,031
And that beard to 6,000 years old

1279
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,311
No problemo

1280
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:10,175
I love or the supposed left-wing media laughing Jordan over Perris

1281
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
Incredible

1282
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
Inability

1283
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
Remember

1284
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,783
Three agencies

1285
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
Who's rainbow boa

1286
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
Represent

1287
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,391
The sole basis of his campaign

1288
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
No big whoop

1289
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:26,047
Republican stage W have repackage wandering confused logo lately

1290
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,119
Engram

1291
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
I somehow Charming

1292
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
These guys are good

1293
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:37,055
They didn't realize their verbally an intellectually ambiguous candidates and politicians

1294
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
Pretty critical analysis

1295
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,175
By rebranding them as a new and improved departure

1296
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,967
From the intellectual Elite

1297
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,551
So you see what you have a pretty good diagnosis if it's okay

1298
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,647
Republican

1299
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
Immunized

1300
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
Themselves against being seen as stupid

1301
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Cuz it's an opposition

1302
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,535
Into some kind of idea of the

1303
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,399
Intellectual Elite he's talking about intellectual is a month and the right-wing

1304
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,239
From his local area

1305
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
This is a fairly

1306
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
Accurate take I would say

1307
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,871
This is middle of the road she goes okay

1308
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,711
They embraced being curious and load the functionally illiterate

1309
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,551
Stupid uninformed and grossly under qualified

1310
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
No no inclusion

1311
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
And their political lexicon

1312
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
But I must say something about Rick Barry

1313
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
I get this guy checked out immediately

1314
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
I'm not sure if he's got a drinking problem

1315
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
A drug problem or a combination thereof

1316
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,423
But something's wrong with this dude

1317
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,263
If your parent or kid acted as goofy as he does

1318
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,823
You'd watch them do a neurologist right away

1319
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
I just think little mixtape

1320
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
What the hell do I have to do to get ahead in this town

1321
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,199
Herman Cain

1322
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,015
I saw they women okay 40 years ago

1323
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,295
Perris y'allywood

1324
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
What about me

1325
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,647
What oregano

1326
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,695
Hey I can play Wall Street sell out

1327
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Come on people please

1328
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Remember

1329
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,559
When it comes to Republican candidates from Bush

1330
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,119
The bach Principe Linda Perry the cane

1331
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,655
It's nice to know

1332
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,703
If there exists not anyting

1333
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
That they can say

1334
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,287
That would be considered so stupid

1335
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,335
And it would disqualify them

1336
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,615
And in a way that's

1337
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,431
Had a nice isn't it what's common

1338
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Jesus

1339
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,183
Is something wrong with Rick Perry

1340
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,463
And I think that's a good

1341
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,535
I can be president

1342
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,935
I'm not sure either and he's like a toothless Joe Pesci

1343
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:46,335
Like you're just confused but you're not afraid of yeah there was a complicated sort of point he's trying to

1344
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,175
I don't think it's complicated the point I think

1345
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,455
It's it's

1346
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,527
The follow-through

1347
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:01,183
Write a whole piece about how there's a rash of stupidity going around the country as evidenced by to military guy

1348
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,583
Can candidates got a lot to be as stupid as they want and that's great

1349
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,607
Is my lovely

1350
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:13,215
Don't you don't you want to live in the world where one half of the political system is

1351
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
Completely stupid

1352
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,567
Those two things are a little bit contradictory

1353
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
Let's Straighten

1354
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,407
So we're going to get to this next

1355
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Report

1356
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
Back to our game

1357
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:29,087
Your offer already.

1358
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:36,511
Let's go with the left-field he's going to he's going to talk about Sammy Sosa that's

1359
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,839
That's what's going to have to talk about

1360
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
I should tell you this

1361
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,447
In terms of sports references he makes it's almost always broke

1362
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,543
It's always prowrestlingtees old school pro wrestling

1363
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,615
Is that the only thing that I'm not sure if there's a baseball reference

1364
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,663
As much as there is talking about like gorgeous

1365
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,455
Just Jordan

1366
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,247
Essentially

1367
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
But heavily script

1368
00:57:59,295 --> 00:57:59,807
So maybe not

1369
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,623
It's not about sports at all

1370
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:15,423
You listen more to me you'll know that I believe I looking at the UK to see where globe

1371
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
Insanity

1372
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
He's heading

1373
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,263
No disrespect to the britons but it's

1374
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
Disrespectful

1375
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
But to be honest the Brits are simply.

1376
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,687
Quest Laboratory disease

1377
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
What insanity

1378
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,527
I'm sure by now you've heard of

1379
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,855
Schools in our country prohibiting dodgeball tag hugging

1380
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
Name is because

1381
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
The fears of

1382
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
Hahaha

1383
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
They all started in the UK

1384
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
I'm telling you if it's not

1385
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
A penny UK

1386
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
You know

1387
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
How to make a good

1388
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
The tourism

1389
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Anywho

1390
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,935
Here's the latest

1391
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
But you won't believe

1392
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,775
Primary schools in the UK are Banning

1393
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
School kids

1394
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
Are you sitting down

1395
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
Having best

1396
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Friends

1397
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
That's right

1398
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Swear to God

1399
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
You're burning kids

1400
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,527
From having best friends why you ask good question

1401
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,599
The first reason is because they want to encourage kids

1402
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
Two-player large group

1403
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,439
Versus focusing on one on one

1404
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
Individualized

1405
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
Amicability in socialism

1406
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,279
Weird

1407
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,815
Socialist message there I guess

1408
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,351
Anime

1409
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Is it metal

1410
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:22,239
They're doing it to save the child from the pain of splitting up from your best friend

1411
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
When I guess the friendship ends

1412
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
Kid moves

1413
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
Give you the heave-ho

1414
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
Predeceases you

1415
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
Suppose

1416
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
Tylenol

1417
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
I just want that one

1418
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Kids and adults

1419
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
Should I have pets because

1420
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
They'll die

1421
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
It shouldn't grow too attached

1422
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,343
Grandparents or their own parents because

1423
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
Advisor

1424
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,647
They're All Dead

1425
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Perhaps

1426
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,719
Self-loathing might be a demon's well because

1427
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,767
You're going to die so don't get to it

1428
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
Attached to yourself

1429
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
I forgot matter

1430
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
Yeah there's a

1431
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
Before you know it

1432
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
What's the real reason

1433
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
Learned helper

1434
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,127
Jazz

1435
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:04,223
When you're subjected to overwhelming unrelenting negative stimuli

1436
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
Without surcease

1437
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
You learn to make

1438
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:07,807
Become helpless

1439
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
Stop

1440
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,463
It's a guiding principle behind the abuse bowel syndrome and our world

1441
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,047
I'm overwhelmed oversaturated with law after law

1442
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,839
Limitations

1443
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
You can't even

1444
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
And now we're habituating kids

1445
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Clear

1446
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
You can do nothing

1447
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
We control what

1448
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
Each month we're reading eventually

1449
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
You'll become

1450
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,455
Habituated and condition

1451
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
And

1452
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,503
When the feeling of helpless

1453
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,295
Completely sets in

1454
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
They will have

1455
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
White

1456
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,855
They will have capture

1457
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Hobbit

1458
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Add juice

1459
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:54,911
So this is a story that Lionel's reporting on out of the sun to r i b a has thinned sourcing

1460
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:59,519
Now that that rag is right on it every time

1461
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,079
Specific schools are Educators who were said to be banning kids

1462
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
From having best friends

1463
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
In that piece

1464
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,199
The entire article is based on to second-hand comments sing

1465
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,479
Some schools are doing

1466
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,295
Directional provided is basically

1467
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
Close to it line was talking about

1468
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,903
Avoiding the pain of losing your best friend if you move

1469
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,951
But it's also supposed to be

1470
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,767
Like the emphasis largely is on

1471
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
Encouraging Group Play

1472
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Instead of children

1473
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Excluding each other

1474
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,887
I have no idea if anyone is actually

1475
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,679
Did you win that from this article though because

1476
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,703
Is no one who's an actor

1477
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,983
His policies mentioned

1478
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
Or quoted in the article

1479
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,615
What super weird isn't this article was published in March

1480
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,151
12 then

1481
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
In March

1482
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,735
2013 there's an article on Fox News quote

1483
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,295
Several schools in the UK issue best friend

1484
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
Dammit

1485
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
These people are all stupid

1486
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,695
Weirdly this is just Fox news reporting on the story in the Sun

1487
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
From a year prior

1488
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,535
Yeah they've always been

1489
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,375
Then in September 2017 there's an article on Business Insider

1490
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,423
Quote schools are Banning best friend

1491
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,959
Protect students feelings

1492
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:06,079
This article is implying that UK schools are Banning best friends but the only source that has

1493
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,407
Is a maryclaire article about a school that Prince

1494
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
Georgia Tann

1495
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,735
Which might be skewed sample set

1496
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,039
Talk about the Royals

1497
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,111
Then in January 2018 there's an article

1498
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,159
On Fox with the headline

1499
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
School band

1500
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Best friend

1501
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
Which is just about the business

1502
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
Insider story

1503
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:28,351
Itself was just about to marry Claire story about the school to Prince George ghost

1504
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,399
God this is that

1505
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:34,751
No more September 2019 there was an article in the Sun

1506
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:41,151
How about how princess Charlotte is going to school where she can't have a best friend

1507
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
School that Prince George

1508
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
Got these people

1509
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,039
Just want something

1510
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,063
Sing so bad

1511
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:53,951
Give me a singular obsession

1512
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,743
This is such that like

1513
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
That rainbow lips

1514
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,559
Stick party thing all over again

1515
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,887
Do you remember the b****** party

1516
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,959
Who are you people sure are you doing

1517
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,495
Yeah you guys doing

1518
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
It still seems a little bit more damaging does Urban myth

1519
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
Don't like Lionel gets the message

1520
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
Of what these stories are

1521
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
Supposed to evoke

1522
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
Yeah it's like

1523
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
Socialist

1524
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,623
Social planners

1525
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,719
Not have friend rate learned helplessness

1526
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,279
Nothing's more 1984 the new

1527
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:33,887
Unsourced report about some Britain's maybe not wanting to have messenger

1528
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,215
Did the Royals

1529
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:44,383
The Royals are allowed to have best friend. I don't know if there is a movement in schools

1530
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,991
Entirely in the United States or in the UK about not letting

1531
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,015
Kids have best friends

1532
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
Play wouldn't be surprised

1533
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,087
There were some schools of the tri-tip

1534
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
Emphasize

1535
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,183
Communal group Lane it's healthier that way

1536
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:01,023
Exclusionary behaviors are generally things you wanted discouraged

1537
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,559
Is not in

1538
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,863
Even if this is what

1539
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,143
A hundred percent accurate

1540
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
The the

1541
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,007
Place behind all of this s*** is coming from is just like

1542
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
Hey

1543
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
Don't exclude people

1544
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,871
Write a good idea

1545
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,199
Why do we have to turn this into a f****** the government is

1546
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,479
Monitoring you

1547
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,271
I think it's so fascinating is like

1548
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,671
For a neuro the span of seven years there's all these articles about the the UK Banning best friend

1549
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,231
Does its catnip to right-wing media sources

1550
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
It is it really is

1551
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,911
Wanted yellow about something but there's nothing really big going on in the news today

1552
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,495
I think I remember that story from like 10 years ago or

1553
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
Breasts best friends were babybay

1554
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:50,687
And it's always presented as like this new thing in 2012 was this new thing beside Sun article

1555
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
The next year in

1556
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,039
Fox News it was being presented as a

1557
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
Even though it was a year old article that was the source

1558
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Godby

1559
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Out of control

1560
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,743
So this next clip Lionel stupid might be an issue for

1561
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,047
Maybe

1562
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,607
So Lionel talks in this next clip about the

1563
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,375
The collapse

1564
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,215
That's coming in the world what do you think is going to

1565
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,495
Precipitate

1566
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
Some petty b*******

1567
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
It's got to be some petty bulshit

1568
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
I'm going to go with

1569
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Pet ownership

1570
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
Egret

1571
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:35,231
It's New Year's weekend

1572
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,815
Television heaven for me luxuriating before the flats

1573
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Screen

1574
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Redskins from the couch

1575
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,399
The wife watching

1576
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:47,007
TV marathons in Moscow

1577
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
We gave you the Honeymooners by gold standard

1578
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
I watch Dallas

1579
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,295
The show's time listen classic

1580
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
I'm back

1581
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,903
Wells flipping through the hundreds of channels

1582
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,231
I came across the most frightening television show

1583
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
That I have ever seen

1584
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,351
What do you think

1585
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
Hey New Year's well it's not the

1586
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
The Twilight Zone

1587
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
It's not Doctor Who

1588
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,519
Let's go with

1589
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
The Bachelor

1590
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,335
Show was impacted import

1591
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,175
Far beyond anything you could imagine

1592
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,479
BB looked at by 7

1593
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,831
Skip through the rubble of our once Pride proud culture

1594
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,927
While many factors caused Rome 24-hour fall

1595
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,999
Will be because of this program the show is called

1596
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,839
My Strange Addiction on and this is the set

1597
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
The warning

1598
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
Chattel

1599
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:50,751
Channel that has yet to apologize for Toddlers & Tiaras

1600
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,543
I know what you're thinking

1601
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,847
Why do you want to chat line Olympics

1602
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,127
So bad why

1603
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,455
Because it's my job that's why I I want it for you I've got

1604
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,039
Not the problem

1605
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,831
Associated with mental illness

1606
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,879
In an effort to demystify

1607
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,927
Andy stigmatize the subject

1608
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:15,327
You're that last there it's cuz he pointed at the employer

1609
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:19,679
Like a band leader

1610
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,727
Hoarding buried alive

1611
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,031
Not to be confused with the Animal Planet

1612
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
Confessions Animal Hoarding

1613
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
But they show

1614
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,639
My Strange Addiction

1615
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,967
Let me just tell you what a few of its episode in no particular order

1616
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,503
There's a woman

1617

Who has Pica syndrome

1618
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:39,135
I was addicted to eating household cleanser you know like Ajax

1619
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,671
She was 12

1620
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,975
You're going to be

1621
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:48,351
You're going to drink bleach buddy maybe not drinking

1622
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
Another woman

1623
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,655
Beige tile

1624
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Toilet paper

1625
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,703
Cleanup course

1626
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,871
Sleeping with her hair dryer

1627
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
Right next to her

1628
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,199
All night

1629
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
Crazy

1630
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,879
It also highlights

1631
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
I won't stop talking to them

1632
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,975
Someone who Tans up to three times a day

1633
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,511
Cannarex Sia

1634
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
Wake up

1635
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,303
You see what's happening

1636
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:23,679
Weird evolving dematerialize Augusta creative cultures iFunny Motors pick mandates

1637
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Mash

1638
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,983
Even Seinfeld

1639
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,567
Giveaway

1640
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,359
My Strange

1641
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Pelican

1642
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,711
Beautiful Barrel

1643
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,247
Not to share or teach

1644
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
Stand before a camera

1645
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
Have you noticed

1646
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,623
Look at me they scream

1647
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,951
Look at me I'm as helpless

1648
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,095
Yeah like that

1649
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,935
It seemed to be that he was sort of

1650
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:58,751
Dancing around a commentary about what art

1651
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,311
Send media word yeah and like

1652
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,871
I think there's a fair point to be made that the way

1653
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,943
The exploitative way people engage with media like

1654
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,807
What's a celebrity rehab or My Strange Addiction version of the Freakshow

1655
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,599
Not

1656
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,391
Exist on television if people didn't

1657
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
What is there wasn't

1658
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,999
The man the supply probably wouldn't be there

1659
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
One season and then

1660
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:29,471
Another season of Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire too far

1661
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,519
Cover boss had two seasons or whatever which is

1662
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
Is bananas

1663
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,551
If that were the katiki was making

1664
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
I guess

1665
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,623
That's fine but then I don't know why you have to

1666
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,903
Point fingers at the people with pie

1667
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
I got like that's a real condition

1668
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:55,071
Yeah it's not like something that people are just making up for attention or something

1669
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,679
Cruel at the end when he's at he's desperate

1670
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:02,495
People on the problem that I have is it

1671
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
Because he's really bad at this

1672
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:07,359
I don't know if that part at the end of supposed to be self-effacing

1673
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,431
Like You shiting on these people on My Strange Addiction

1674
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
For the desperation

1675
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:16,063
Be in front of a camera but meanwhile he is so desperate to be in front of a camera that he thinks insulting

1676
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,599
Countess worthwhile comment

1677
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,879
Like I don't

1678
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
No

1679
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:25,279
I really don't know if that was meant to be a winking job in himself at the end or bruised just accrual outro

1680
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,351
Punching these people who he is only heard about cuz they're open

1681
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,655
His mother struggle and because of that

1682
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Because I can

1683
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,447
Can't tell

1684
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
It's a bad day

1685
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,519
Yeah

1686
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,847
I think why I think what would really undercut

1687
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
His biggest

1688
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
His biggest problem

1689
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
Is I think in most of it

1690
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
These clips

1691
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
He has

1692
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
Kind of

1693
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
Gotten the point

1694
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
That in each one

1695
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:52,159
He's also kind of given a nod to that idea of like

1696
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,511
Will be there about D stigmatizing mental illness and getting people more comfortable with it

1697
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,303
And then incredibly up

1698
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,839
Obtusely ghost

1699
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,887
Hard against that is humanly

1700
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,423
Like almost deliberately

1701
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,007
Like he's he's literally like these are people who deal with stray

1702
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,031
Strange addictions

1703
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
And we're watching

1704
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615
But also it does help us

1705
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,407
Kind of get more comfortable with the II

1706
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
The idea of it

1707
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,223
Spiga mental illness

1708
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,807
And hey look at how dumb those Dum Dums are for going on TV

1709
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,623
Desperate for attention

1710
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
It's very weird

1711
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,463
If you'd made it more

1712
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Clear

1713
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,279
Like at the end if that was supposed to be like

1714
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,815
Winking like

1715
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,143
I am desperate for attention to

1716
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,959
You should have laid that the the setup for that

1717
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,727
Punchline

1718
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,031
Throughout the rest of the

1719
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,567
Some hints along the way

1720
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,871
It stands now it really

1721
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
Just feels mean

1722
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
It feels like

1723
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,711
Pointlessly mean

1724
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
Because buddy

1725
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
You're talking about 1

1726
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
You're living through the f***

1727
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,367
Golden age of television

1728
01:11:54,623 --> 01:12:00,767
With the Mad Men and Breaking Bad and so many of The Sopranos like this is the Golden Age

1729
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,119
And then not only that but he's not going out

1730
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,143
After

1731
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:10,495
Reality TV shows that are based entirely around Gathering attention like f******

1732
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,567
The Bachelor or Jersey Shore or any number of

1733
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,103
He's going around reality TV shows

1734
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,151
Biggest around people who are struggling

1735
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,199
This is a meme

1736
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
4

1737
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,367
Criticism that could be made of

1738
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
Of

1739
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
That John ra of television

1740
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,023
I just think Lionel is incapable of it certainly Within

1741
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,071
2 minutes so he just goes this route

1742
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,399
Keeping people who are in trouble or dealing with stuff

1743
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
On the real world are looking

1744
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:40,959
Retention

1745
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,543
People who are on My Strange Addiction or sometimes people who just

1746
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
Cannot afford to go

1747
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:50,687
Any other way and those types of shows they do deal with

1748
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,991
Like things that will be a problem

1749
01:12:54,015 --> 01:13:00,159
But there was a situation on the real world Road Rules challenge where a couple of dudes sexually assaulted a female contestants

1750
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:06,559
And like of course they were never on the show again like they got sued and like that

1751
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
Programming because of obvious like

1752
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
There's an issue

1753
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
Yep yep

1754
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
There there is

1755
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,703
The demand

1756
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,751
Would be a problem if not

1757
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,799
Activating address this thing

1758
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
Same thing with the

1759
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,103
I can't remember

1760
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,151
What it was theirs that VH1

1761
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,967
When they were trying to do all their their reality show stuff

1762
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,271
There's a show called Megan wants a millionaire

1763
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,063
Are the contestants

1764
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,159
Choose like a gold digger lady and I'll have you

1765
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:37,535
There was also the there version of real world Road Rules challenge it was called I love money

1766
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,071
And to be like the people

1767
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,351
Competing for Vermont

1768
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,679
And there was a contestant who was on Megan wants a million

1769
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,495
Who then ended up on the Isle of money

1770
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,335
I am that guy after they had

1771
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,895
Filmed the season of I Love Money

1772
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,711
He murdered his wife okay well that's not good

1773
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
It was a Grizzly Mart

1774
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:01,599
Yeah they dismembered and like like put her in a suitcase

1775
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,623
They're only able to

1776
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,903
To determine it was her because

1777
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,951
The serial number on her breast implant

1778
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,535
Yeah the only way to Lionel would know about that is if her last name was but

1779
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Stroke

1780
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,399
What ended up happening was

1781
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,215
They just canceled That season

1782
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,007
Even made it never came

1783
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:22,591
People believe it's because he

1784
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
He won

1785
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:29,503
So it's like you can just get rid of the first couple episodes

1786
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:37,183
What I'm saying I'm trying to get around 2 is that there is a

1787
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:43,839
Weather is an actual demand or an applied demand element that will alter content that is Supply

1788
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,399
So if people started engaging with

1789
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,423
Content like

1790
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,983
These rehab shows for

1791
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,823
My Strange Addiction in ways that work Freakshow it

1792
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,359
Yeah the treatment of it was

1793
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
Vanderwood

1794
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,223
The be less incentive for the shows

1795
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
Created in that vein

1796
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,063
Right and the way Lions behaving

1797
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,855
Is actually part of the problem

1798
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
100

1799
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,159
So

1800
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,951
Because he's there for the

1801
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,231
Exploitative nature of

1802
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,255
These programs

1803
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,279
That's what he's there for

1804
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:18,143
Let's bet he's the demand but it's his job

1805
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,471
So why this next one

1806
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
Alright

1807
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,823
I would try and ask I would have drink

1808
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,359
Give me a word

1809
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,151
Yeah give me a give me a direction

1810
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Hard

1811
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,807
It's a social criticism

1812
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,623
Don't know if that helps

1813
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
You got me

1814
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,255
I'm going to go with walking okay

1815
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,047
Some people are saying Sumer is

1816
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,655
Battling

1817
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
Some people are saying

1818
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,495
X or Y

1819
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
Wait some people are saying

1820
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,407
Text people are why

1821
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,687
Okay that's not

1822
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,271
I mean that is as good of a Templars I can give you and you are never going

1823
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,575
Alright I'm going to go with

1824
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,903
Well obviously if I'm never going to get it I'm going to say young people are out

1825
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,463
I'm going to go with

1826
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,047
Complains about the used as much as it seems

1827
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,071
Yeah

1828
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:26,495
It seems like maybe does I'm going to go with some people think women are capable of holding public office

1829
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:32,383
It says some people think women be shopping

1830
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,647
Hero might be the most overused word of our Alexa

1831
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,415
Next

1832
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,951
Genius and love

1833
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
Look

1834
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:53,375
We all are thankfully nothing happened at Times Square and more thankful that the mad bomber turned out not to know diddly-squat

1835
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
What about

1836
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,727
Okay here we go leave that nothing happened

1837
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,263
It's going to be a tag

1838
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,311
Everyone was Vigilant and alerted the

1839
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
The cops are the hero

1840
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
But Statham

1841
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,383
Laudanum

1842
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:08,991
Appreciate them congratulate them but not automatically bespoke bestow

1843
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
The Halo title of hero

1844
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:17,439
Lionel gets a certain amount of time on air for these reports and he sat down it was like you know what I'm pissed

1845
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:21,279
Stop that people reporting terrorist attacks are being called to your house

1846
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
I don't think of

1847
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,423
I wouldn't say that this take

1848
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,239
Is heroic

1849
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,823
Heroism involves an act of Bravery doing the right thing

1850
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,359
Calling 911

1851
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,407
Calling the cops is what's to be expected

1852
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,711
Civilized people do

1853
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,759
Suggest that is heroic

1854
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
To alert the cops

1855
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,367
Mom said something's wrong means that getting involved is not the norm

1856
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,671
We want to thankful for being alert

1857
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,999
We've seen the video of that poor man

1858
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,303
Left to bleed to death a load of the sidewalk

1859
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,095
A man who really was a hero

1860
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,911
He showed bravery and stop the woman from being mugged

1861
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,727
How about Wesley Audrey who in 2007

1862
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,567
Lay on top of a complete stranger who had fallen on subway tracks

1863
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,359
As the train passed over him

1864
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:10,431
Psychologist now refer to the bystander effect

1865
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,223
Where people see something

1866
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,247
I do nothing

1867
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,039
It conjures up Kitty Genovese

1868
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,599
So we appreciate anyone who alerts

1869
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,391
The cops what yes

1870
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:27,071
Is that involved hero overuse is a verbal version of grade inflation

1871
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,655
Is becoming an automatic reflex response

1872
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:34,239
That's will be Mentor show thanks and well-deserved thanks it that

1873
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,823
You know how many police dog what's your f****** point

1874
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,103
Kind of Duty have received

1875
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,383
Heroes tribute

1876
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:45,247
But those jobs as Wonder Woman greater fantastic as they are

1877
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,039
You're my hero

1878
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,087
Harold M fine but I hear a whisper

1879
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,367
Special and Hillman

1880
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,671
Basic Congressional Medal of Honor

1881
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,207
Which isn't even given to

1882
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:59,071
Everyone actually demonstrating bravery give the Rush Limbaugh

1883
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,119
Vacuous gallantry

1884
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,167
And intrepidity at the risk of

1885
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:06,239
One's life I've been through.

1886
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:10,079
The word hero was almost holy and recognizes

1887
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,615
Quintessential Valor

1888
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,943
Gyro sandwiches

1889
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,991
Guitar Hero and the worst

1890
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,063
You know how is ear wax

1891
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,855
Speaking the word for photocopying

1892
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,903
It's yet state for all the teams of tape

1893
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,951
Don't let that happen to Hero

1894
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:26,975
Remember

1895
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:31,071
The First Amendment doesn't protect someone from yelling fire in a crowded theater

1896
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
Okay

1897
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
And only if

1898
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,399
There's really no fire

1899
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,935
Because if there is

1900
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,215
It's you dude

1901
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Write me

1902
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,543
Read me in, did you see fit

1903
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:45,407
So if I understand correctly it's your duty to yell fire if there is a fire

1904
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
So if you don't

1905
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
You are

1906
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,735
It's Europe

1907
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,551
You're going to be arrested for not yelling fire

1908
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,343
It's against the law

1909
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,391
First Amendment to not yell fire

1910
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,207
This is a this is a weird

1911
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:03,071
Point to that part of it is very weird

1912
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
So there was a

1913
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,911
People who they reported a suspected

1914
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
Carrboro

1915
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:12,031
Right here at least Amanda crisis was averted everything worked out okay

1916
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,408
Bent out of shape about this

1917
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,968
8 for a guy

1918
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,992
Like Lionel

1919
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,576
To argue about the sanctity of words

1920
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
And their definition

1921
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,952
While at the same time tossing out as many $10 worth of

1922
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,976
Possibly can

1923
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,000
Places that

1924
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,792
Do not need them there

1925
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:38,912
The only reason you would use those words as if you need to be incredibly in very specific

1926
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,520
Not if you wanted to show off your f****** vocabulary hero word

1927
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
And shut the

1928
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:48,896
How to really good

1929
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,992
Yeah I think I might respond to this if I were just like

1930
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:59,648
I like to do is I like to imagine that every single thing I hear from Lionel is somebody saying this to me at a dinner party

1931
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:06,048
Look up I'm hanging out like a cocktail a cocktail

1932
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,352
This guy's telling me that people are here

1933
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,400
I think my response to this be

1934
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,984
Relax

1935
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,288
Calm down

1936
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:19,616
No people over use the word hero too much

1937
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152
Okay

1938
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,968
I don't think there's a sort of a position that I

1939
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,736
Turn the corner

1940
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,272
I might have agreed with him

1941
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:31,136
My younger years theater and the movie Coach Carter came out

1942
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,208
And the movie was all about

1943
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Complete this coach

1944
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,512
Yahoo

1945
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
Close the

1946
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
Jim

1947
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
The gym

1948
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:43,680
Because the students are there on the team we're failing in unless they got their grades up they couldn't

1949
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,960
Play sports some reason

1950
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,496
I recently watched

1951
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,800
Coach Carter

1952
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,824
I think it's I think

1953
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
I can't remember I think

1954
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,712
I want to watch it on Netflix with my partner there

1955
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,760
I don't I don't remember if it's a good movie

1956
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,088
You're not you just saw it so you might be able to have more insight on it but

1957
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,392
You know what it's very paternalistic

1958
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,024
Yeah I got that idea of the hard-nosed kochuri

1959
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:13,376
Teaches people a lesson about

1960
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,168
None

1961
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,704
White people version of the blind

1962
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,520
Like it's your IRA

1963
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,056
Say nothing about the movie

1964
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,616
Cuz I don't remember it well enough

1965
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
I have a critique

1966
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:28,736
My position on it back then and I remember telling a lot of people that

1967
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,760
Was that

1968
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,040
He's supposed

1969
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
To do that

1970
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:38,208
These kids are failing these supposed to not let them play sports if they're feeling

1971
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:42,048
Is he being considered a hero movie

1972
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,584
I think

1973
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,448
Now is 35 year old man looking back on that position I hadn't think it's a little assholes

1974
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,984
Because the

1975
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,008
Not so much

1976
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,312
Doing what you're supposed to do

1977
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,104
That is considered a heroic

1978
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,128
Text thing it's

1979
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
The results

1980
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,944
That comes from it that your celebrate

1981
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
So

1982
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
The ACT

1983
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
Even a trivial

1984
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,064
Tritech dry heroic

1985
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
In the in the right circumstances

1986
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:12,512
And I believe that Lionel's missing that Forest 4-3 but there's a certain amount of

1987
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,792
What do you have to over

1988
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,072
Overcome in order to

1989
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
To do what your

1990
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Expected

1991
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,912
You know it would be

1992
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,704
Legitimately heroic

1993
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,008
If somebody actually

1994
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,800
Control of our current

1995
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
Situation in

1996
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
F****** do some s*** about this

1997
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,920
Until like they're f****** supposed

1998
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,040
It would be because the the insurmountable

1999
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,320
Simple odds are there

2000
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
Just doing

2001
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,880
Your job is

2002
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
Sometimes eroic

2003
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:40,928
And taking

2004
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,720
Take It Outside of that

2005
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
Contacts

2006
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:47,072
I mean like if you think about what you have sorry for putting a knife

2007
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,400
Even even talking about like what do you

2008
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,192
Have to overcome Lionel makes that clear

2009
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,752
The psychological bystander effect

2010
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:59,360
Exactly it is almost built into your human brain

2011
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:06,528
Is there wouldn't be a name for it if it wasn't something that was studied and is a shortcoming of human reason

2012
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:12,160
Something happening you soon someone will take care of it

2013
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
Overcoming that

2014
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,512
To the point where like I got to do something

2015
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
It is

2016
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,096
Is abnormal you should celebrate

2017
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:23,936
Call The Gyro call it's the get her done guy

2018
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,704
Call It Whatever

2019
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
You f****** want it doesn't matter

2020
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:30,336
I work is pedantic nonsense

2021
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,360
The movie Boondocks

2022
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:36,224
You think he's a bun. I think he's a Boondock Saints I think that's what's going on there

2023
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,760
Absolutely

2024
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,808
I think he's been fighting Willem Dafoe for

2025
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,880
For years now

2026
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,000
I did not

2027
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,792
Open upon Master blackface

2028
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,328
In Boondocks

2029
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,400
No but there is a lot of racism

2030
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:59,264
Well it's interesting there's a load to defend blackface

2031
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,104
The good answer

2032
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,408
Here here's where it's at

2033
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,064
I don't know if I would say that Lionel is defending blackjack

2034
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,600
There's an earthquake

2035
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:19,488
I will say that this next missive of his

2036
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,280
To work

2037
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:36,384
Donkey story about blackface it seemed an Australian Cosmetics makeup brand was

2038
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,712
Is running an ad that appeared as though the woman depicted was in

2039
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
Blackface

2040
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,296
Blackface but I'm not sure what

2041
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:47,136
Blackberries as in Jolson or Minstrel show or they know that Cakewalk

2042
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,416
Looking for a woman

2043
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,696
Dressed in black

2044
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,488
Dark-complected of the caption read

2045
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,512
Not dreaming

2046
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
Applewhite

2047
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:00,704
I need to know why I'm describing is right here

2048
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,800
Take note

2049
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:07,360
It was very simple rule that you must learn

2050
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
Especially

2051
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,688
If you're in the communications World blackface

2052
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,968
He's never without a

2053
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,016
No one will ever ask you

2054
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
Are they won't ask you

2055
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,624
Spaces the message the theme that means

2056
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,696
Action whether it's instructional historic houses all good

2057
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,976
We Care not

2058
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,256
What your intent was

2059
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:28,096
Correct messaging strategy

2060
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:31,936
You're nailing it inspires a meeting objection and time and without fail

2061
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704
It's almost

2062
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,728
Jumble pavlovian

2063
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,496
Don't like

2064
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
There's a butt

2065
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,800
Even if it looks like

2066
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,384
I honestly don't think that's

2067
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Totally true

2068
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,456
Like I on it I really don't

2069
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,528
Don't think that's true I think there may be a conversation

2070
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,064
That comes up around

2071
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
Artistic

2072
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,904
Uses of black slaves or whatever

2073
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,928
Late but I don't

2074
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,208
Has

2075
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
The negative

2076
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,536
Social stigma that Lionel's drink

2077
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,560
To paint it to be

2078
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,328
When it's used

2079
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,352
In context

2080
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,144
It is kind of like okay whatever

2081
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,216
Like robertdowneyjr didn't suffer any consequences for doing it

2082
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,752
Tropic Tropic Thunder

2083
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:11,360
Because it's because of the parity in the movie

2084
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,408
The boy on how that is

2085
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,688
Real loud

2086
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,248
In ways that let's say this austere

2087
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,296
Yeah

2088
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
Bureau. Org

2089
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:26,976
Say Ralph northam's

2090
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:27,744
Rdr2

2091
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
Being prime minister

2092
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,864
I should also say that this is not the only video

2093
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,656
Of his that's about blacks

2094
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,448
Would not be sunrise

2095
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,984
You tried to point out that like

2096
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,032
Hey with a Wayans brothers made white

2097
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
Chicks

2098
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,336
Oh man

2099
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:45,408
A boy that is a man deliberately

2100
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
Try not to get to the

2101
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,736
Good pretending the people.

2102
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:53,600
Say like it's f***** up

2103
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
Right

2104
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:55,904
Eagles

2105
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
I remember

2106
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,464
There are scores of people

2107
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,000
Who thrive on being offended

2108
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:06,144
Do they pour over the news

2109
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
The Scottsboro boys

2110
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
Remember

2111
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,336
In November of that year my wife and I saw the production at the lights

2112
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,128
I thought was a protest

2113
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
Guess what was important to know

2114
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
About the center

2115
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,736
Okay I'll save you the time

2116
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
Sex

2117
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
Who heard about the

2118
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,320
The blackface party

2119
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
Hadn't seen the music

2120
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
They heard about

2121
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
The black actress

2122
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,952
To perform really

2123
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
The production

2124
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,744
Didn't seem to take offense

2125
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,536
Probably because of two major point

2126
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,072
First

2127
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,680
Do I recall it was

2128
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,240
1999 the Brooklyn Museum of Art

2129
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,288
I met a Rudy Giuliani

2130
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,592
To the painting The Holy Virgin Mary

2131
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,872
They contained

2132
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,176
Inter-alia impudent

2133
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,480
Prince is an elephant dung as a theme

2134
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,248
Now

2135
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,272
Let me remind you first

2136
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,552
It was Rudy

2137
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,832
And the story got a lot of traction

2138
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,600
Second

2139
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,624
He was offended

2140
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,440
Offended and care not about the symbolism of imagery

2141
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,256
I need love the warm glow of being a

2142
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,280
Ended we all do

2143
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:09,120
Violated our senses and Sensibility under attack

2144
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,936
As Roman blasphemy and you are ready for

2145
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,472
We loved

2146
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,776
To be offended offended therefore I am

2147
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:20,640
I definitely that cannot be missed is that because I am unable to appreciate your message

2148
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:24,992
Because I'm unwilling or incapable of appreciating are grasping your message

2149
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:25,760
So bad

2150
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,296
For you I'm offended

2151
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,832
You lose and that's it

2152
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,136
No importance Auto idea is not

2153
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,952
Capable of not offended or insulted or angry someone

2154
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,512
If an idea or messaging is so bad that I didn't say

2155
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,072
Nana. It's not worth even having

2156
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,096
Watch lese

2157
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:43,936
The marketplace a free-speech involve the marketplace of controversy I

2158
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,960
Thrive

2159
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,008
America

2160
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,032
It who

2161
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
We are

2162
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
Trouble

2163
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
As you say

2164
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,920
This is

2165
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:56,480
Weird contradictory thing where it's

2166
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,784
It seems to be the entire report

2167
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,600
Is about people are too offended by blacks

2168
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:06,464
Yes but then by the end he's talking about how great it is that people are offended cuz

2169
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,512
People thrive on controversy

2170
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,304
So it's actually a good thing

2171
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
No I don't get

2172
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,144
I don't get what's going on

2173
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,984
He's shiting on people who are offended by blackface

2174
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,264
That's stupid you're right your weight

2175
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,312
Too sensitive you shouldn't be offended by this

2176
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,408
Beyond the guy we all love controversy roll-up to be offended

2177
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
Is Brittany

2178
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,736
Not presented as that being a bad thing

2179
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,040
Being like in to being offended

2180
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,856
It seems to be like that it's all good

2181
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
This I think

2182
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,952
What's going on is

2183
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,232
He's fine

2184
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,512
Is old version

2185
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,280
I'm taking if a

2186
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,560
Informative

2187
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
And full of bulls

2188
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,888
But I think he feels it but he's again

2189
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,912
People taking

2190
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,704
Actual offense

2191
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,984
When something offensive

2192
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:50,752
What is going on

2193
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
You're supposed

2194
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
To just perform

2195
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
But you can't ask

2196
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,152
He doesn't like valid criticism valid

2197
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,200
Anything he just enjoys

2198
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,992
22 and a half minute

2199
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:01,760
Pieces

2200
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,088
He's like that guy who just likes

2201
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,904
To argue right when you're like f****** I don't have

2202
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,672
Not today

2203
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
Not today

2204
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,744
So people are mad

2205
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
Sometimes

2206
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,280
About black

2207
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:21,472
Well. According to let's just call it right it is overblown

2208
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:26,080
Alright look through it and see what's going on

2209
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:32,224
People really don't like talking about how racist white people

2210
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:38,624
But something else is not

2211
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:45,024
Whiteface Lodge

2212
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,120
I'm going to try and make it through this commentary without soiling myself I

2213
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,680
Tend to lose certain bodily functions when

2214
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,728
I'm subject matter invades my

2215
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,752
My soul and I

2216
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
Speaker

2217
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,640
I have to actually put into words and explain and explicating limb the

2218
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,456
Basis of my contempt I feel

2219
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:09,856
A rage that may be hard for you to understand what am I talking about first I hate hate I hate the word hate

2220
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:16,000

No word or concept

2230
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,880
Come close to even describing the vast and incomprehensible disgust

2231
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,184

2318
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,744
You compare that to his other material which is

I don't know where priority at the right area

2321
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,032
People sit somewhere too long

2322
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:50,432
People are offended by referencing the absolute exploitation and murder

2323
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,736
Entire race but

2324
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,016

2325
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,320

This is something you don't know

2338
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208

01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,872
I won't dance

2342
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:58,272
I don't ask maybe you'll see the story about the couple who was arrested for allegedly dancing going to New York

2343
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,296
Subway platform

2344
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,624
Well after they were pinched for impeding something-or-other

2345
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,928
And now they're showing

2346
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,464
I wish them well

2347
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
Play absolute

2348
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:10,304
Advocate the prohibition of all dancing

2349
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,864
I mean criminal incarcerated

2350
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
As Cicero said

2351
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,448
No sane man will dance

2352
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,752
Ballroom dancing square dancing polka

2353
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,776
I don't care

2354
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:23,616
I am without that part of the brain or nervous system. Crave

2355
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
Silly movement

2356
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,920
Ostensibly set

2357
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,200
Perceive

2358
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,760

Musician

2360
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,416
I misplaced the neurology

2361
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
There was this throughout our history

2362
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
Ordinance

2363
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,768
The artist that limited public

2364
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:41,792
Dancing all together

2365
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
Why

2366
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,144
Is dancing a natural

2367
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,960
Counter-revolutionary

2368
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,240
Bill joke

2369
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,520
Why do some stretch

2370
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:55,616
And you can fill in the blank with your particular favorite conservative face system but

2371
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,664
Why do they never make love standing up

2372
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
Because I look too much like dancing

2373
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,248
I'm being very serious

2374
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,600
For some atavistic primordial reason why we loathe Nancy because remember

2375
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,392
No sane man will do

2376
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,000
Why we doing a lot of work there buddy

2377
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,304
Better again atavistic and vestigial

2378
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,840
Why do we not our heads

2379
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
To indicate affirmation

2380
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
Because it mimics

2381
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
Cycling our mothers

2382
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,728
Why do we shake her head no

2383
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,008
To mimic the action

2384
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
Spitting out something bitter

2385
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,824
Why do we dance

2386
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,104
A reason to base

2387
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,408
To attract mating partners

2388
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,944
Define embark

2389
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,712
Territory

2390
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:36,320
Two events dominance in for the most part in human Kaiser to create the illusion of hot

2391
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,600
Sexy and attractive

2392
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,672
Tell your weight down the structure and control

2393
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,952
Proceed right

2394
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:46,304
Total breakdown of civilization

2395
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:49,120

Homicide

2397
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,520

01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,368
Can shows up and go

2405
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:16,768
Give him the people's elbow like there's no other way that this function he doesn't reference Footloose at all this is weird

2406
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,912
Based on his political set

2407
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,704
Possibly want

2408
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Dancing bear

2409
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,264
Possibly want that

2410
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,312
The only way

2411
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,872
Dancing fire in a crowded theater

2412
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:36,224
Right when there is no fire fire dance

2413
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:36,992
You're still not here

2414
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,552
If the fire walk with me out of DaVita

2415
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,576
Yes

2416
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,112
Dd2

2417
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
He has to be making

2418
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,488
Obviously doesn't want dancing bad

2419
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,280
And it's clearly not the point he's making

2420
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:52,352
This is satire element of it doesn't make sense

2421
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,400
I do but it's all good fun whatever

2422
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:57,216
The problem though is that Cicero quote that

2423
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,544
He bases his whole thing audio staying man will dance

2424
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,336
Translation of the actual quote

2425
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:06,432
Sleep sounds

2426
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,200
Quote Cicero

2427
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:09,504
The quote is taken from Pro Marine

2428
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,856
Which is the context of Kato accusing a dude of being a dance

2429
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:18,208
Which apparently back then was a serious accusation

2430
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:24,864
It's like a man who doesn't wear a hat in the death at that point yet

2431
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,680
So in response to this Cicero says quote

2432
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,704
No-Man

2433
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,728
One may almost

2434
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,032
Today ever dances when sober

2435
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,336
Unless perhaps he be a mad mad mad

2436
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:37,920
Nor in solitude nor in moderate or sober party

2437
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,760
Dancing is the last companion to prolong feasting of luxurious situation

2438
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,040
And many refinement

2439
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,344
The basic argument he was making

2440
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,392
Against this accusation was that no one

2441
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,928
Other than a Madman dance

2442
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,952
Sober

2443
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,744
And he was being he wasn't bi

2444
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,024
Accused of being drunk

2445
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,328
So the accusation of being a dancer must

2446
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,608
Be an accusation of being

2447
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,376
You mad

2448
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:00,192
Paraphrasing the quote as no sane man will dance

2449
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,216
Fine I guess

2450
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,008
But then attributing that quote

2451
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,288
Cicero is really unfair

2452
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,080
It essentially is putting words

2453
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:09,408
Cicero's mouth or more accurately taking context a wave

2454
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,688
What you was actually saying

2455
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,712
Cicero weather

2456
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:13,504
Singly insane people dance

2457
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:16,576
Drunk people dancing

2458
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,368
No sober not yet

2459
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,904
Insane person

2460
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,440
These guys got

2461
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
Home all the time by myself

2462
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,768
Are you drunk

2463
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,560
No well somebody you're crazy

2464
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,352
Anyway

2465
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:35,008
I have a singular obsession with how all these people like you end up becoming fascist bootlicking cheerleaders

2466
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,824
Inability to understand

2467
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:38,848
No idea

2468
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,872
I'm really getting

2469
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:43,200
To the point where I'm starting to wonder if that commonality is significant

2470
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:43,968
Among them

2471
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,504
Like if there's actually a legitimate

2472
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
Piece of

2473
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,576
What informs their ability to

2474
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:52,672
To deal with the world right they can't understand quotes within their proper Khan

2475
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,768
I wonder if you want a chickadee eggs

2476
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
Situation like that

2477
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:58,816
I'm not sure

2478
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,608
I'm going to buy the thought that I'm having is

2479
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,376
Weather in Ogden

2480
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
Be predictive

2481
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,984
Like you see somebody who is unable to wrestle with what a quote

2482
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,032
Where it comes from

2483
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:10,848
If that makes them more likely

2484
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,872
Into being a right-wing

2485
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:15,456
Maybe even though right when you could break you the director

2486
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
Computer Museum

2487
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,784
These right-wing

2488
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:21,344
But that might also be partially because

2489
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,880
How ascendant that is

2490
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,184
In the conspiracy world right over the last

2491
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,976
The left wing

2492
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,536
Conspiracy world has not been nearly as fertile

2493
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,304
Overground

2494
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,584
Particularly is Blaziken

2495
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,864
Make money

2496
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:37,984
The SV the right-wing were obviously see the results

2497
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:44,896
I wonder I wonder about that is interesting is there a hike nearby with your grade school I might make it my feet

2498
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:50,784
Coli idea like just give somebody like what do you think this quote from Thomas Jefferson mean

2499
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,320
And then in small print

2500
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:58,720
Are you sure it's from Thomas Jefferson 2 hours as real as hell

2501
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:02,048
It's perfect

2502
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,072
To skew the results

2503
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,864
Have the knee-jerk

2504
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:08,448
That's true.

2505
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,472
There'll never be

2506
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
Figure out what these quotes

2507
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:15,616
Is the formulation of it they like

2508
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,688
He's thrown around in memes of like

2509
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,224
Using that is

2510
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,064
Not a fair description

2511
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,344
It's better than just saying

2512
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,416
Nope no sane man will dance

2513
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,208
Same time though it's very much

2514
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:30,976
Schleich

2515
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
That's

2516
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,280
Controlled

2517
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
Media

2518
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,864
Because they don't want to

2519
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,888
Expand beyond that

2520
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:43,264
If a source they trust gives them a quote about some b******* that reinforces their beliefs

2521
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,824
That's just a true quote regarding that you don't

2522
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,640
It reinforces what I already buy

2523
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,944
So for a lot of people

2524
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,248
Maybe one of the issues is that

2525
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,272
Real quotes

2526
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,808
Reinforce what the left

2527
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,624
And fake quotes reinforce what the right

2528
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,184
I think this one's a politically neutral

2529
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,000
Yeah that's true for almost more in

2530
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:09,376
Interesting to me obviously these are weaponized by

2531
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:13,216
Propaganda Outlets are all the French militia windows and stuff

2532
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,264
This one is really just

2533
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,288
Right

2534
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:22,688
I want to complain about dancing behavior is similar

2535
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:28,064
I have an old white man prejudices so I'm looking for a quote that reinforces my old white man fragile

2536
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,648
That parallel there

2537
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,696
So I should tell you

2538
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:36,000
I got to go through Lionel's

2539
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,536
YouTube page

2540
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,328
Scroll through hit5

2541
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:44,448
Everything good maybe watch the hundred other videos that are not talk about cuz they're so goddamn boring

2542
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,472
Right

2543
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,800
Almost all of these have

2544
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:49,568
Like 300

2545
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,360
These are old videos

2546
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,408
But no one has ever watched

2547
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:59,040
Stop of them only have 10 like these are longshoreman

2548
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,392
Spelunking for both

2549
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,672
This next

2550
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,440
First one

2551
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,464
Out of nowhere

2552
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:09,280
Has 100,000 vehicles

2553
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,560
What did the

2554
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:15,424
Okay alright what could Lionel penetrate

2555
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,984
The Consciousness with this video right before it

2556
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,800
200 use

2557
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,824
15

2558
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
This one

2559
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,616
100

2560
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:27,712
Okay this is going to be Colin Kaepernick

2561
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:30,528
No this is before it's too early

2562
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:35,648
Damn it really for that it's got to be something like that right it's got to be something that can

2563
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,672
Captured the zeitgeist

2564
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,696
In 2012

2565
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,488
Early 2012

2566
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
Yammit

2567
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,376
There's nothing to do with politics

2568
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:49,472
Nothing to do with Paula. Going to do with like the 2012 election okay

2569
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:53,568
Get that out of your mind all right there's no way you'll ever guess

2570
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:59,968
I was going to go with like an American Idol or singing TV show

2571
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:01,760
The Rock

2572
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:17,632
Who are we or anyone to say what is and isn't a legitimate religion

2573
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:24,544
Why would I know is I mean this has to be islamophobia

2574
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:31,456
That's an interesting way you think now you're wrong

2575
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,224
Judgment

2576
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,040
Are the theological authenticity of one's faith

2577
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:39,392
Psychologist precisely what this Intrepid young man wanted to know

2578
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,416
His name

2579
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:43,488
Nico Alma Lionel's hero of the week

2580
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:50,400
Mr. almond Austrian

2581
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:55,008
Please inspect these photographs

2582
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:59,360
Got it seems that the time discussion

2583
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:03,712
Provision of the European Union in Austria's recognition of quote

2584
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:06,528
Confessional headgear in official photographs

2585
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,344
You don't really even have the perennial caseware up

2586
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,416
Muslim woman wants to appear in the driver's book

2587
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:14,464
I think she like me wearing a hijab or

2588
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,744
Are there various types of

2589
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,608
Muslim headgear in Vail American as a burger

2590
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:27,264
You you responded with a gas but like mocking yeah I should be clear at this point in his career he does

2591
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:32,896
Does not seem to have like

2592
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,176
It's that in Pryor

2593
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:40,320
Atmosphere to Austrian motor vehicle authorities that he was up

2594
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,856
Pastafarian

2595
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,136
Remember

2596
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:47,232
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster as depicted here

2597
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,768
And this holy painting

2598
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,584
Its website states that the only Dogma

2599
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,376
Allowed in the churches the reject

2600
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:54,400
Action of Dogma

2601
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,960
They also listen part as articles of faith

2602
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:58,240
But they believe that pirate

2603
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:00,288
The original pasta Burien

2604
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:04,128
We're peaceful explorers that it was due to Christian misinformation

2605
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:08,992
Are they have an image of outcasts criminal today

2606
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:13,600
Explain that pursuant to his face he had to wear a plastic

2607
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,880
Pasta strainer

2608
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,416
As religious headgear

2609
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:21,280
Play sideways of course in the photos display needless to say the Austrian officials

2610
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:24,352
We're not amused by the pastafarian mr. Rime

2611
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,400
Troy Baker prove his Bona fides

2612
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,448
And eligibility to Tool about

2613
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:30,496
Nico had to undergo

2614
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:34,080
A psychiatric evaluation do establishes mental Fitness to drive

2615
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
Now stop

2616
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,640
Wouldn't that be great

2617
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:38,944
A psych eval to get a driver's

2618
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:39,968
Think about it

2619
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:41,504
This city will look I got ghost

2620
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,576
I'm guessing that it wasn't a psych evaluation

2621
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,624
To see if he could drive and was more like

2622
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:50,464
This guy says he worships the Flying Spaghetti Monster let's make

2623
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,000
Sure cuz that sounds

2624
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,560
Outside of the context of what pasta

2625
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:56,608
Safari in ism

2626
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:59,424
Not knowing any context yeah that might be something is like

2627
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,960
Remind me to check in on

2628
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:03,264
If you were familiar with the internet you be like

2629
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:11,968
Well this month three years later I'm happy to announce that mr. Nicolas

01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,528
Pastafarian and member in good standing

01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,088
Of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster

2632
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,392

For this posture straightener calendar chapeau firmly and can

Vacuously affixed

2637
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,864
Stupid about mr. arms Nagin

2638
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,400
Play sideways of course

2639
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:33,728
Austrian officials certainly not to be accused of being

2640
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,008
Antipasti

2641
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:38,592
Haha remarked that as long as his face could be made on fuelly

2642
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,432
Be good pretty much Google

01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,992
Apostrophe arianism

2645
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:45,760
Or the church

2646
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,296
The Flying Spaghetti Monster

2647
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,600
To which I'm currently announced

2648
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:50,880
That's neck

2649
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,160
Coming

2650
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,440
As you see fit

2651
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,976
So I don't know I don't know what

2652
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:56,768
Is it good

2653
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,584
He seems like you should

2654
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,888
You shouldn't tease open way religious

2655
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,960
Yeah at this point is career

2656
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:06,240
It's weird because he becomes

2657
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,264
The Giant Killer

2658
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:12,640
Max Coronavirus

2659
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,944
Yeah

2660
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,224
It's strange

2661
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:20,576
But I think that's about as middle-of-the-road of a report

2662
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,856
As you can do

2663
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:25,440
It's just about this guy isn't it cool

2664
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:31,840
But he did to this thing at school but also a little silly and so that's just kind of like hey let's reflect on this being

2665
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:34,144
Cool in Philly yeah there's there's a like

2666
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,448
Quirky interest to a knot

2667
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:38,752
That's as close to a

2668
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,824
Find Lionel report there's no real

2669
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,128
Sister anything that goes along with it there's no like

2670
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:44,896
He's

2671
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:47,200
He's pointing out kind of the

2672
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:50,016
Certainty of religion as a whole and this whole thing is

2673
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:50,784
He's kind of threatened

2674
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,552
I would have

2675
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,088
I would imagine the defiance

2676
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:56,672
Spaghetti monster doesn't want YouTube and dancing

2677
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,952
Yeah

2678
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:00,000
And it's so weird to me that I mean

2679
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:03,584
I get over you interesting if it turned out the John Lithgow was

2680
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
That would be weird

2681
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:11,776
I just think it's strange that this got so many more views than any of these old

2682
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:18,432
I guess I guess probably the pastafarian online community sent it around maybe there wasn't

2683
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:20,480
Coverage of this story

2684
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:24,320
Baby was early coverage

2685
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,088
Something like that

2686
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,112
But he probably

2687
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
Just got meme

2688
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:33,280
I didn't realize that there was that robust of a pastafarian community or maybe this was picked up by the reaction

2689
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,560
Right wing

2690
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,840
Kind of people who are like

2691
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,888
We got to talk about this

2692
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,960
I doubt it I think it was I think

2693
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:42,240
If I would assume

2694
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:48,384
My assumption would be it was more just these people who were into those articles any world

2695
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,176
Bring it out so 100,000 views

2696
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,200
Zapped

2697
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:51,968
Which is

2698
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,016
Shockingly Moore

2699
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,296
All like this

2700
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:59,136
The ceiling thousand times the ceiling for a lot of these

2701
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,952
Videos like being very generous is like 15

2702
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,744
Yeah like these are not

2703
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,560
No one watches these again

2704
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:11,680
There are decades they've been online for 9 a.m.

2705
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,448
Gears

2706
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,824
Alright alright well he knows

2707
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,872
I'm surprised he didn't lean into the zeitgeist

2708
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:25,760
I said I would make both spoiled up off the phone

2709
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:30,112
Safarian that's what almost makes me think that possibly these views all can

2710
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,136
Came like later

2711
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:37,280
Yeah they came like 2 years after he posted

2712
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,560
A f****** news.

2713
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,912

So alright

2718
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,712
It's really hard for me to

2719
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
To try and

2720
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,272
Lead you down the road

2721
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:02,112
We have a chance without giving up

Call Total

2723
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:05,184
But like I'm even to this next

2724
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:10,304
Lionel thinks a president did something

2725
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,120
What do you think it is and who's the president

2726
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:13,888
Okay

2727
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,656

Consummate badass

2736
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:46,656
Akule was noticed that the benefits fruit salad in

Campaign ribbons I like the cut of his jib

2738
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,240
Understated

2739
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,776
You didn't have to impress you

2740
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,312
You were thinking of going off

2741
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,336
Trayizon us

2742
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128

01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:02,784
Understood man with a tremendous leg

2746
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:07,648
But what sets wde apart is that he's Christ

2747
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,416
Smack

2748
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,208
It's secret meetings with aliens

2749
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
Dig

2750
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,768

I can the FBI scheduled

2752
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,864
Sit down by sending out

Various installations including Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico

01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,056
The fact

2756
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:25,824
I can whistle

2757
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:29,408
I just got UFO sightings on many occasions remember

2758
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,200
During WWII

2759
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,736
Allied Pilots reported

2760
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:33,760
Kissing balls

2768
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:52,192
But be serious until that store

2769
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:52,960
I know

2770
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:53,984
There's something out there

2771
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,520
Always has been

2772
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,592
They've been here plenty of times UFOs

2773
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,896
Whatever you want to call them

2774
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:01,920
Harvey

2775
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
Demos

2776
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,248
It's your government

2777
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,528
Idea

2778
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,576
Ivar being the lone planets

2779
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
Supporting life

2780
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
The Beyond

2781
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,696
The age of our planet is four-and-a-half

2782
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:15,232
Billion years old that's

2783
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,256
45

2784
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,536
100 million years

2785
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,584
If another planet was just

2786
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,864
4510

2787
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:24,960
1 million years old it will be a million years more advanced

2788
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
Buckle

2789
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,288
Fossil

2790
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:30,080
Play 107

2791
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,640
I could do it but music dance

2792
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:33,664
Dumb bastard

2793
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:39,296
What fossil record show of modern man first appeared in just a couple of hundred thousand years ago

2794
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:41,344
German soldiers and thousands of

2795
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,624
Honda's real time

Professional Witness

2799
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:50,048
And not inclusive

2800
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,608
The French comida report

2801
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
Terraria

2802
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,168
You bring this up

2803
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,704
Invariably someone will say

2804
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:59,520
But why do they want to make contact with us

2805
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:01,568
They have

2806
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,104
And do

2807
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:05,408
Why would anyone want to speak with us

2808
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,200
Have you ever gotten Down Under

2809
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:07,968
Round

2810
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,504
Face-to-face with ants

2811
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:10,784
Real quick

2812
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:14,624
It's really weird because this isn't a bit this is clearly he thinks

2813
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,904
For sure that

2814
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:18,464
First of all aliens are coming down and talking to us about

2815
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,512
It's not a joke

2816
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,864
Hipolito

2817
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,400
Seemed to believe he's no joke

2818
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:28,960
It doesn't seem like there's a joke the end

2819
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:31,008
The gear he's talkin about the like

2820
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:34,592
Why haven't they contacted us yet who answers to that one

2821
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:35,360
Is

2822
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,128
They have

2823
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,944
I meant his second one is why would they want to

2824
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,248
Contradict

2825
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,296
Yes if you like you talking to an

2826
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,880
But then the first answer was they have and they are

2827
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,952
It would be like me talking to an end

2828
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,720
Which I do

2829
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,024
Talk to them

2830
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,048
Why not

2831
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,840
Why is going to communicate with them

2832
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:56,864
Maybe because

2833
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,888
They're Bonitas

2834
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
Baby beagle

2835
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,704
We are quite there beneath us

2836
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,264
Observed

2837
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,544
And not disturb them

2838
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:06,336
You got the picture and look at me

2839
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:08,896
Kermit

2840
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:09,920
That is juice

2841
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:13,760
I like her

2842
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:17,600
Is an alien supremacist

2843
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:18,880
You dumb bastard

2844
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:22,720
Alien more than human

2845
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:23,744
I do

2846
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,536
I do like the root of a

2847
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:26,304
Metairie Lodge

2848
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,584
Betty's appliances

2849
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:31,680
Well if our Earth is 4.5 billion years old and we are here

2850
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,728
Then that means that if there is a planet

2851
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:34,496
Methods for

2852
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:36,800
Point six billion years old

2853
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:43,200
Then they have a 4.6 billion year old mathematical mathematics

2854
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,736
Million year

2855
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:50,112
To do with win life might have been the progress of

2856
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:54,720
Any pressures that might have caught that would lead towards

2857
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,000
Branching right now

2858
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:59,328
You don't have a billion year Head Start just because of this thing is old

2859
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,608
Lionel dump

2860
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,632
Lionel is buried

2861
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:04,448
Next clip I think Ikea

2862
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:09,824
Double D Eisenhower

2863
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,896
I swear to God when he wrote that down he was

2864
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,432
I might be the smarter

2865
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:21,600
And he probably thought like this is Ribble.

2866
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,928
This next Copa America ask you what you think

2867
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,952
It's about guys

2868
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,792
I just need to tell you that I think the only reason I kept this clip

2869
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,328
Or I took it at all is

2870
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:33,376
Because Lionel uses the word Sneaky Snake

2871
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:45,408
Papa papa

2872
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,200
Fear of

2873
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:47,968
Snakes

2874
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,736
Y'all

2875
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:52,064
Phobia is unique in that the fear component isn't Park

2876
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Why should I

2877
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,880
As some snakes are venomous

2878
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:58,464
Bulshit man there's so many fears that are rational

2879
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:03,584
Irrational

2880
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:08,192
Anybody who's anybody is afraid of heights is crazy

2881
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,216
Fear of dancing

2882
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:13,824
Well I want to wish I knew the name of it there's got to be a name for it

2883
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:17,920
Not local area that's certainly true

2884
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:18,688
Completely rash

2885
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,248
If you're allowing visits

2886
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:23,040
Snake fear is rational

2887
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:25,088
Fear of cars isn't rash

2888
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:27,392
Probably kill more people

2889
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:28,416
Vile

2890
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
Behavioral

2891
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,720
Experts believe that the fear of

2892
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:31,744
Snakes Express

2893
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,024
Hyper

She is believed that

2898
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,984
Since he was now farther away from the ground

2899
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,752
Where is snake

Through retro selection and evolution

2909
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,368
Wouldn't that be the same with all sorts of

2910
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:03,488
Predator things that you're afraid of

2911
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,560

02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,664
Whose account

2957
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,712
The Escapist

2958
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:01,760
So that's

2959
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
Andre

2960
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:05,344
Medicine serpent

2961
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,368
Messenger of death

2962
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:10,208
Marching down Broadway while fighting New Yorkers run for their lives

2963
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:11,744
It wasn't

2964
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,512
Escape

2965
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,560
They found it in the reptile house

2966
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,584
Outside of her

2967
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:18,912
Which would have been my first place to look

2968
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,728
Charles Manson fails

2969
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:24,800
Escape from the

2970
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,384
Even Bindi Irwin the lakefront cutters

2971
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,664
12 year old daughter said

2972
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,480
He's probably right by the case

2973
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,528
Meanwhile Olivia

2974
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,112
Comments

2975
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,392
Has UCF

2976
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
So

2977
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,952
Here's what's great about this

2978
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,232
First of all

2979
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:47,328
I'm in the trade issue of a snake escaped that even within the report you like it was

2980
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,864
The big deal

2981
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,400
I don't know why we're doing this

2982
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,936
I don't I don't know at all but

2983
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:55,008
He does referencing his snakes

2984
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,800
Most important thing though is that

2985
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:57,568
Lionel

2986
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,848
Is on a New York

2987
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,384
TV show

2988
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,920
He hates Trump

2989
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,968
Yep he hates truck back in like

2990
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:10,112
2011 yes Trump is a dick that's cuz he hadn't unsealed the indictments yet Dan Trump

2991
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,648
Thousands of Secret at night

2992
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:14,208
Lionel very regularly will make

2993
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:16,256
Jabs at Trump for the birth

2994
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:18,304
Get stuff for him being a birthday

2995
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:21,888
And one of the things that I wanted to actually do was

2996
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:23,680
I wanted to trace lynels

2997
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:24,704
Towards

2998
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,496
Supporting Trump

2999
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:27,776
Because I think

3000
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:31,616
It follows a very similar path is the people we've seen like Alex and Nick Flint

3001
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:34,432
But actually his path is a little bit

3002
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
Different

3003
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:36,480
He's super

3004
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,504
Against Trump

3005
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,808
As the campaign begin

3006
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:41,600
Yes and then

3007
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,392
He gets to a point where he's like

3008
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,672
Alright you had your phone

3009
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:45,696
Cut it out

3010
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:48,256
You're good you either need to stop what you're doing

3011
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,536
Or just get out

3012
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:53,888
Yeah you if you tell them to drop out in September 20th

3013
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,192
Like he's just not into this

3014
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,472
Anyting

3015
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,240
At all

3016
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,264
Then once

3017
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,312
Trump becomes like really

3018
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:04,384
Likely to be the candidate on the GOP side

3019
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:05,664
He adores

3020
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:07,968
And the reason is just Auntie Hillary

3021
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,272
When he endorses Trump it's a

3022
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:12,832
Dual endorsement

3023
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,856
Trump and

3024
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,696
Because it is a specifically anti-hillary

3025
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:22,560
Anybody but Hillary is not super interesting to me in terms of the the right wing

3026
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:24,096
Have towards Trump thing

3027
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:26,656
Like the Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones

3028
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:30,240
Seem to follow like a very similar trajectory of

3029
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:33,056
Like real negative horrible things

3030
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:34,080
Things about Trump win

3031
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:37,152
Trump shouldn't be in their orbit or they shouldn't

3032
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,688
Care about him all that much

3033
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:42,016
And then right around very similar times they end up supporting him

3034
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:46,880
With Lionel he's a New York media guys obviously he's been aware of trump for a really long time

3035
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,416
It doesn't like him thinking

3036
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,696
Is a piece of s***

3037
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:53,280
New York and then when he starts running for office I got right we're tired of this act

3038
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:57,632
Whatever

3039
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,912
Potential drop has

3040
02:05:59,168 --> 02:06:01,472
Of like destroying the GOP

3041
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:05,056
These are rhinos

3042
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:06,848
Yeah whatever

3043
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:13,248
Listen to that in the same way that he's into what Bernie Sanders could do to the Democratic right

3044
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,272
A certain amount of

3045
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,808
Just disruption of

3046
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,112
It's a sports both of them

3047
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:20,928
The system doesn't work so he's going for either

3048
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:22,208
Candidate that is not the

3049
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:26,048
Yeah I get that also primarily I got to listen to a bunch

3050
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:29,120
Primarily it is surrounding like

3051
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:31,424
The cab Jack's hatred of Hillary

3052
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:34,752
So it his path is not that

3053
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,544
Although

3054
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,080
It is interesting

3055
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:38,848
To hear this

3056
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,384
This next

3057
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,408
Report that he has

3058
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:45,248
Lionel talks about what sort of President he would vote

3059
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:51,136
It's interesting to hear this

3060
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:54,464
With the awareness that later he would end up supporting Trump

3061
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:04,960
Don't ask me who am I would endorse her

3062
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:08,544
Vote for in the 2012 presidential elections because

3063
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:12,128
I need an indoor senior voting for either mittens or hoping

3064
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,152
But

3065
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:16,480
But if I had to crap the ideal hypothetical candidate

3066
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:19,552
But I might even consider is maybe already my vote

3067
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:21,344
Bubba's have one characteristic

3068
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,368
They must

3069
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:23,648
Be crazy

3070
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:24,672
Abby Flame

3071
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:30,560
Is it what I would insist upon in a presidential candidate with necessarily mean they never have a chance

3072
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:31,328
The Wynn

3073
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:34,912
The platform that I would insist upon her so out of sync

3074
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:36,960
Were the candidates the left and why

3075
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,520
Paradigm offer so antithetical to the status

3076
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:43,616
Do polar and antipodal do most of the brain dead in

3077
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:46,432
Brainwashed electorate that the only candidate

3078
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:49,760
Who'd even come close to passing my Electro master

3079
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,808
Be the candidate everyone would call

3080
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:52,832
Crazy

3081
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:59,232
Just say you like Ron Paul over this dumb dumb you know who you like

3082
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:00,256
Hanson hello Canada

3083
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:03,840
People who want to revolutionize and undo the

3084
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:04,608
Expected

3085
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:06,144
Status quo in the usual

3086
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:08,704
Reconstitute

3087
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,008
The business really invade country

3088
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,056
Brain-dead Washington

3089
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,592
My guy

3090
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:17,664
And for anyone to even think they had a chance

3091
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:20,736
That would by definition make them

3092
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:21,760
Crazy

3093
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:28,672
I will never vote for a candidate for the left or right side of the identical coin the greatest and grandest of deceptions ever

3094
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:29,952
Old in this country

3095
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:30,976
Next to the neck

3096
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:31,744
Tattoo

3097
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:32,768
Is a myth

3098
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,536
Truant

3099
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:37,632
Actual political action

3100
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:40,448
Significantly

3101
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,728
The delusion that

3102
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:42,496
That will

3103
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:43,264
She'll always

3104
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:45,312
Skip this great and Grand Country

3105
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:46,592
From Africa

3106
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:49,920
From the death grip of the globalist international

3107
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:50,688
Stripping

3108
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:53,248
And only someone

3109
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,528
Crazy

3110
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,064
Scared to go out today

3111
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:59,136
Democrats again have Barack Obama

3112
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,416
On the Gob

3113
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,952
Is Mitt Romney is

3114
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,744
The debates are a waste

3115
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,280
Or has someone said

3116
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:09,120
You're like watching McDonald's debate Burger King

3117
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:12,704
Fry's

3118
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,008
I called them The Identical duality of left their wife

3119
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,032
Someone

3120
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,056
Crazy

3121
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:20,896
Give me a candidate who would demand that the FED be released

3122
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:27,552
The drug called would be repealed

3123
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:29,600
Defensive nothing will be done without Annex

3124
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,440
I'm. Hocus

3125
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:38,560
Spoke is an illusory virtually Reserve currency the best ERA

3126
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,352
You

3127
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:41,376
Another words

3128
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:42,912
I want a candidate

3129
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,448
Who is crazy

3130
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,496
I never have a chance of winning

3131
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:48,032
Someone who would be best

3132
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:51,104
Describe as that great life

3133
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,128
Chili's crazy

3134
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,408
But what if he's right

3135
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:54,688
Stop it

3136
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:55,712
As you see

3137
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:57,248
You're courting a

3138
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,784
Comedy show

3139
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,576
Also what if

3140
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:02,880
Please do not write

3141
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,720
Yeah that's real fun

3142
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:12,352
F***** up to hear years prior to family supporting Trump is becoming a qanon guy

3143
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:14,400
But yeah you know what I want somebody's crazy

3144
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:20,288
And what it really doing else only three people pass the law to create the Federal Reserve

3145
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:24,128
As useful as what a crazy person's brother would say

3146
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:27,456
What's really fascinating to me about this is

3147
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,784
Dat dere that essay that Webster

3148
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,808
Tarpley Road

3149
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:33,088
About like Winthrop

3150
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,112
Started to become

3151
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:34,880
Ascendant

3152
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:35,904
Within the GOP

3153
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:38,208
That essay that you wrote about how

3154
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:41,536
The failures of the Ron Paul libertarianism

3155
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,352
I have the implied

3156
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:48,192
Cruelty of that worldview that went unexamined

3157
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,216
Was aopa

3158
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:53,056
The vestibule vet is fascism

3159
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:59,456
Like I don't have any respect for Webster Tarpley appearances on that The Obama Deception or on Alex's show

3160
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:01,248
But that essay was

3161
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,528
Incredibly precious

3162
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,344
It really was about the the ways in which

3163
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,392
Like just sort of

3164
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:08,416
This

3165
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:10,464
This fanatical support for Ron Paul

3166
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,768
And the deterioration of it

3167
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:15,072
Because Ron Paul had no f****** chance Adele

3168
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:15,840
The whole time

3169
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:18,400
And then once Ron Paul stop running

3170
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:20,448
Rand Paul comes into the more dis

3171
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:21,472
Pointing option

3172
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,008
Absolutely not going to do it

3173
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,544
It leaves his vacuum

3174
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:27,104
Where people are

3175
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:28,384
Prime

3176
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,920
To to go in that direction

3177
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,712
And what I hear

3178
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:35,040
Lionel talking about what I want is a crazy person

3179
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:35,808
Yeah

3180
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,344
Obviously you talkin about

3181
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,880
Ron Paul in 2012

3182
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:39,904
He's talking about the

3183
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,720
The disappointment that Ron Paul didn't make it through the primaries

3184
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:44,000
That's the subject

3185
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:45,024
Of

3186
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:46,816
He's getting at

3187
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:48,096
And

3188
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,376
When you hear that

3189
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:51,424
And you know how things went

3190
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:55,264
It's really easy to see on a certain level and Moshe

3191
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,288
Going to leave it like

3192
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,056
That is

3193
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,848
Did Lionel walked

3194
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,384
Yeah yeah absolutely

3195
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,152
Disappointing

3196
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:03,200
It is it is very much

3197
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,992
Schleich

3198
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:07,808
Sorry it made manifest publicly a lot of times as like

3199
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:13,952
Everything is Whitey Bulger anything but Hillary

3200
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:17,536
It is it is hard to

3201
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,584
It's hard to read that web

3202
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,608
Tarpley essay

3203
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:21,632
Not be like

3204
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:22,912
Oh I get it at

3205
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,936
Takes one to know one

3206
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:25,728
You know that kind of thing

3207
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:28,800
Like the only the only voice that was really

3208
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:32,128
Putting that together on that in that world

3209
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:33,920
At the time was

3210
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:35,200
Unfortunately

3211
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,736
A bunch of dumb dumbs

3212
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:39,040
Like what you know your own

3213
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,320
Community better than

3214
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:44,672
Times you can have the more critical eye on it

3215
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:46,976
I love you and I would like if there's a

3216
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:52,608
It's not like Ron Paul's policy set was all bad

3217
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:55,936
There are a lot of reasons why you might support him

3218
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:58,496
Yeah they aren't involved in the like

3219
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,800
Rank cruelty and awful things

3220
02:13:02,336 --> 02:13:04,128
Things like getting out of foreign

3221
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:05,920
Entanglement

3222
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:08,224
The positive thing that ate that is something

3223
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,504
That you could have gravity

3224
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:13,856
Tulsi gabbard talks about wanting to not be in Wars

3225
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:16,416
And it makes sense to gravitate towards her for that

3226
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:20,768
Consol drug legalization

3227
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:21,792
Those are things

3228
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:23,584
Things that you can really get on board with

3229
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:25,376
The Dead

3230
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:29,472
Flip side of the coin with people like Ron Paul's all the like

3231
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:32,800
Stripping away protections for vulnerable communities in the United

3232
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,568
It stayed up

3233
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:36,384
Getting rid of all foreign aid essentially committing

3234
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:42,016
I think II genocide of people throughout the world

3235
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:43,040
Our efforts

3236
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,320
Are humanitarian

3237
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,088
No it is

3238
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:48,416
Specifically remember around this time because

3239
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,184
Cuz I was

3240
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,744
I was trying to make you

3241
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,512
Someone

3242
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:53,280
I'm not saying this

3243
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:54,304
Webster Tarpley

3244
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,072
But it is

3245
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:56,608
Possible that someone

3246
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:58,400
Of his his order

3247
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,960
Could be like into the good stuff

3248
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:01,984
Recognize

3249
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:05,056
As it goes along oh no this is metastasize right

3250
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:06,336
The negative things are

3251
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,616
The things that are the focus

3252
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,896
It's now

3253
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:10,432
Call it a b b y

3254
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,456
What you were saying

3255
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:14,528
No I remember this time.

3256
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,296
Like

3257
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:17,856
I had just been maybe a year or two in

3258
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:19,392
The stand up at the time and

3259
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:22,464
There were plenty of comedians I remember

3260
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:25,024
Talking about how much they supported Ron Paul

3261
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,328
And in retrospect you look back in your life

3262
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:29,632
You had no idea about the

3263
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:36,544
Yeah you only knew about that cuz I cuz I've known these people for 10 years now and it's like they would never say

3264
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:39,104
Support destroying divided protect

3265
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:43,200
For all regulations

3266
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:43,968
But

3267
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:45,504
Put so much of the b*******

3268
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:47,296
Rompope

3269
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,320
Through it and

3270
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:50,624
That was that was very Apple

3271
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,392
Appetizing

3272
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,416
And and

3273
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:53,184
Just like

3274
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:59,584
Yes somebody's finally saying this obvious thing and it galvanized a lot of you like populist feeling of

3275
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:03,424
Suspicions about what are these Financial

3276
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,448
Yeah tutions

3277
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:08,032
He's doing like yeah absolutely also another like

3278
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,568
Reasonable thing

3279
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:11,616
To have concerned

3280
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:15,456
Like with Ron Paul it almost always

3281
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,736
Gets funneled into

3282
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:18,528
A hard right

3283
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:20,576
Conspiratorial version of

3284
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:21,856
Yeah it's

3285
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:24,672
The inverse of the coalition

3286
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:25,696
Supported Obama

3287
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:26,464
Ryan 2008

3288
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:27,744
Of that like

3289
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:29,280
We're here

3290
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Because we don't

3291
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:30,816
Trust

3292
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:33,376
Any of these people we've been f***** over

3293
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,400
10 years

3294
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,680
You have run on

3295
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,960
Champagne of

3296
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:39,776
Take care of all of this s***

3297
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:43,360
And then instead of funneling us into the hard right

3298
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,152
Vicente

3299
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,200
And that's just not going to last

3300
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:50,016
Yeah that's what Ed that's where we f*****

3301
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:52,064
Obama head

3302
02:15:52,576 --> 02:15:56,416
Man it's hard not to look at 2008-2010

3303
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,184
NSYNC

3304
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,976
Those were the two years where we could

3305
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:00,512
Anteverted

3306
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:01,280
All of this

3307
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:04,096
Look at that

3308
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:05,120
It really is

3309
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,912
Wow save that for a book

3310
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:08,704
I can't do it.

3311
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:12,032
Someone can write that book

3312
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,568
What's the Unabomber

3313
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:15,360
So I think

3314
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:18,688
I think that Lionel being like I'll only vote for a crazy person

3315
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:21,248
Is a representation of

3316
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:24,064
Like the kind of mentality that went wrong

3317
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:28,416
Because what he's talking about is

3318
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:29,440
This can

3319
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:30,720
Candidate that fulfills

3320
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:33,536
These requirements that I want that Ron Paul

3321
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:35,584
What are you saying

3322
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,888
Necessarily all like

3323
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,680
Destructive horrible things

3324
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:41,472
You don't like auditing the Fed

3325
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:44,288
Obviously there are audits that are done

3326
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:45,568
Just don't you pretend there are

3327
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:48,384
But that was like a demanding that be done

3328
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,664
Alright I'm not really mad about

3329
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,200
Legalizing

3330
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:51,968
Drugs

3331
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:52,736
Absolute

3332
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,808
2

3333
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:56,832
YouTube The Kings

3334
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:59,904
That would be deemed Crazy by people right

3335
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,208
That's what he wants in a candidate right

3336
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,536
Fine but where it gets murky is when a real crazy person

3337
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,304
Comes around

3338
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:08,608
Henrico everyone's calling him crazy

3339
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,936
That must mean that he's insane

3340
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:13,216
That's where the thinking

3341
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,496
Absolutely

3342
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:16,800
She's one last Lionel report

3343
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,592
And I'll just

3344
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:21,408
Set this up I'm not going to ask you not going to quit

3345
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:23,200
No I wish

3346
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:25,760
Cuz he and I might find common ground

3347
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,552
Suspicion of being

3348
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,320
Then we could all find

3349
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:29,856
We also

3350
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:30,624
My girl

3351
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,904
It'll kill you

3352
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:33,184
So this

3353
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:33,952
Last one

3354
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:36,768
Is a real misogynist open

3355
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:39,584
It's real

3356
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,376
Colostrum it's real bad

3357
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:44,448
He takes potshots at Gloria Allred

3358
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:47,776
Hard like

3359
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:48,800
She does nothing

3360
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:50,080
Wolf

3361
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:54,688
It's mostly about this woman who was working at bank

3362
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,760
The bank but she was fired

3363
02:17:58,016 --> 02:17:58,784
And then she

3364
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:01,088
Claimed that she was fired because she was to attract

3365
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,368
Shorts

3366
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:05,184
Like a media interest story but what's behind

3367
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,208
Play Capitan

3368
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:07,232
Sexual harassment

3369
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:08,000
Situation

3370
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,328
Lionel minimizes that and I don't want to

3371
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,608
Get to bog down into it

3372
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:13,632
Because the way this

3373
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:15,168
Is

3374
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,192
Gorgeous

3375
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,472
Thisara is

3376
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:21,312
Lionel maybe getting his comeuppance a little B motor light

3377
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:23,872
For really trying to be a misogynist ass-whole

3378
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:34,880
A work is a pro wrestling turnbuckle

3379
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:39,232
Putting something over on the audience to believe that slow

3380
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:42,048
The biggest work is that Abyss genius

3381
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,584
BB lorenzana

3382
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:46,656
Vandervoort alternate spellings than Kadafi

3383
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:48,448
Now here's a story

3384
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:54,592
Deborah doing that because she says they fired her because she was so darn sexy

3385
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,920
Can you believe this I swear to God

3386
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:58,944
I hear the story line

3387
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,480
Beverly Electric

3388
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:03,296
I can't help it if I'm a seductress

3389
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:07,136
Olaf has a siren distracting Mad Men

3390
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,416
Lyric Me

3391
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:10,208
Living testament to the beauteous

3392
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,000
Chromosome

3393
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:15,072
Her allegation was actually that her boss said that she was

3394
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:15,840
Too attractive

3395
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:17,120
Distract

3396
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:17,888
Thinking that's why she

3397
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:23,264
Not her saying I'm too hot to work somewhere

3398
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:26,592
The onus on the wrong parts.

3399
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:28,384
Coronavirus

3400
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,456

3401
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:34,528
Do it rain

3402

And women jealous

3403
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:40,672
Colossal

3404
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:47,072
But wait there's more

C02 defense lawyers are Riding Freedom in the midst of auto asphyxiation

3410
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:04,736
Nobody knows exactly what Gloria Allred does that mean she's a lawyer but

3411
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,784
She represents people who don't leave represent

3412
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:12,416
Okay

3413
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:14,720
She was injured or what you beating or what

3414
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:15,488
Nothing

3415
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,632
Murdered his wife there's a dozen the only reasons to get a lawyer where you injured

3416
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:23,680
Call Peterson murder his wife in this

3417
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:27,008
Amber was a mistress

3418
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:30,592
You should she needs representation.

3419
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:32,640
Maybe you're going to be

3420
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:35,456
Characterized the media you do need somebody

3421
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:41,088
So Glorious that were visiting one of Tiger Woods's shemales that he allegedly

3422
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:41,856
For what

3423
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:43,392
Why she hurt injured what

3424
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,416
Holdout

3425
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:47,744
Again it's the same situation you're somebody who's being brought in

3426
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,768
Into a story

3427
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:52,608
That you don't have the ability to handle Gloria Allred

3428
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:54,400
It is

3429
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:56,960
They're to be a guide

3430
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:57,984
To help you with the

3431
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:00,800
And by the way that term to ask there

3432
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:03,872
Like that is out of character a Lionel

3433
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:06,176
He is generally super

3434
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:14,624
Did this person was trans or anything like that this woman that I don't know what that is that is

3435
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,904
Just an insult

3436
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,928
Being applied

3437
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,976
Inaccurately inappropriately

3438
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:20,256
I thought that was

3439
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:21,792
Lionel

3440
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:23,072

02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:27,680

02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:10,176
We're jumping the gun

3453
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:12,992
Picture from this victim of corporate terrorism

3454
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:13,760
Coronavirus

3459
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,608

If you like to find out what you said call me after the show

3463
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:39,616
In any event

3464
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:41,664
She stands up to

3465
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:43,456
Seek redress in the courts

3466
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:49,600
Absolutely

3467
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:50,880
Plans of mice and men

3468
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,160
I would have bet this one

3469
02:22:54,464 --> 02:23:00,352
This is the award show

3470
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:10,592
That doesn't for the pics news at 6:30 that's what we call a big fat ACU back here tonight at 10

3471
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,456
That's a bit misleading

3472
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:16,736
That's a gut punch

3473
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:22,368
Misogynist b*******

3474
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:23,648

NES right

3481
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:41,312
She deserves welcome

3482
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:43,104
How to invalidate your in

3483
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,128
Entire premise

3484
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:50,784
The entire misogynist bulshit that you're you're

3485
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:52,064

Brutal

3489
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,464
Going for it

3490
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:01,280
This will be

3491
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:03,072
Be insurmountable I will

3492
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:04,864
Stand atop Mount Everest

3493
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:07,424
And I will scream from the heavens it's okay

3494
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,216
Women

3495
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:12,032
Again this is the thing where we

3496
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:13,568
Fart sound

3497
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:14,336
It would help

3498
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:17,152
Because it's been a number of situations or things have gone

3499
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:17,920
Very poor

3500
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:24,064
In a live comedy stage setting

3501
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:25,856
And I see that and I see

3502
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:27,136
Guy who cannot roll up

3503
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,672
That is not

3504
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:29,696
That is not

3505
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:31,232
Nope inability

3506
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:34,816
Why are you letting

3507
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:37,632
I don't know 10 seconds of dead air happen

3508
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:38,656

02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:44,544
Gloria Allred.

3512
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:47,872
Within two seconds of their being dead are you should be

3513
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:49,408
Figure out what's up

3514
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:54,784
Yep your life TV baby oh yeah

3515
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,320
This is the whole thing

3516
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,344
This is my big

3517
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:59,648
Lionel had a great

3518
02:25:02,208 --> 02:25:02,976
God privilege

3519
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:05,792
He had a great opportunity afforded to him

3520
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:06,816
And that was he

3521
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:07,840
He had a

3522
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:09,120
Column

3523
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,400
On a TV show

3524
02:25:10,656 --> 02:25:12,704
You have 3 minutes where you could do

3525
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,472
Antifa

3526
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:15,008
Whatever he wants to do

3527
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:15,776
You wanted cuz

3528
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,056
He's like David Brooks

3529
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:19,616
If there was any goddamn editor

3530
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:23,968
You think Banning dancing B

3531
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,736
Does not mix

3532
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:26,016
It's like this.

3533
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:27,040
Like David

3534
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:31,136
Yes if David Brooks was

3535
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:37,536
Trying to be funny and it was audio we would cover it more as a podcast

3536
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:39,072
I'm going to anyways short

3537
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:41,888
This

3538
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:45,216
He has this opportunity in front of them and he

3539
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:45,984
Just

3540
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,752
Fails

3541
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:47,776
Constantly

3542
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:48,800
But yeah like there's

3543
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:51,104
Points that he's trying to make their kimchi

3544
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:52,384
Stairs

3545
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,688
A murky line of like is this

3546
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,968
Supposed to be a joke

3547
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:56,736
Or are you

3548
02:25:56,992 --> 02:26:00,576
Sincerely making this argument

3549
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:02,368
And then the most of it

3550
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,648
Waste of time

3551
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,672
Absolutely

3552
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,440
Amazing

3553
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:07,744
I kind of love it because

3554
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:10,560
It's exactly the thing you would have

3555
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,840
Expect for like the

3556
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:14,912
The previous career of a qanon

3557
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:16,960
It's the kind of

3558
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:17,728
Trivial

3559
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:18,496
Right

3560
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:22,080
Marginally reactionary bulshit yet

3561
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:25,408
If they let him do it for a while that's what's crazy

3562
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:28,992
It is one of those examples of

3563
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,040
First

3564
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,320
A white dude

3565
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:33,088
Fill up

3566
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,904
Anja second like

3567
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:36,928
When the steak

3568
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:37,952
Pixar this low

3569
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:39,744
When the stakes are

3570
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:42,048
I don't like backpacks in the

3571
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:43,584
It's like

3572
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,864
What are we going twice.

3573
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:45,888
What's up

3574
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,192
What will you do

3575
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:49,472
Give me 3 minutes

3576
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:53,568
Eventually he'll go out to pasture and drink bleach will call it a day

3577
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:59,968
We don't know if you drink bleach it's just part of the thing that's associated with q and not have not heard Lionel actually saved your place I know

3578
02:27:00,224 --> 02:27:02,784
I'm saying that as a necktie

3579
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,576
The key for the entirety of cumin

3580
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:07,136
Tottenham synect

3581
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:16,608
How about a Master P you want some of that s*** up in here trying to flex literary terms all day

3582
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:22,752
So we reach the ends and Lionel has

3583
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,288
Knocked it out of the park

3584
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:27,104
I was going to say worn out his welcome

3585
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:32,992
I think a lot of people have I get this alot

3586
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:33,760
From listen

3587
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,296
Like they want more line

3588
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:39,648
Yeah and they questioned why has there not been enough 3rd Lionel

3589
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:41,440
Install back which now there is

3590
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,464
And what are the

3591
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,744
Reason to like I can't stretch

3592
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,304
It's hard

3593
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:47,584
To get

3594
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:48,352
Decent

3595
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:49,376
Content out of

3596
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:51,936
Even though he has a ton of videos

3597
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:56,800
Little 3-minute burst if you got to go through tons of them to find ENT like

3598
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:57,568
Anything interesting

3599
02:27:58,336 --> 02:27:58,848
Here's what I

3600
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:00,384
I think people

3601
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:01,920
Want

3602
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:02,688
The

3603
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:03,456
Correct amount

3604
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:05,248
And that needs to

3605
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:06,016
Be careful EQ

3606
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:08,064
Nobody wants

3607
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:11,648
Too much final is a line that has a very

3608
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:12,416
Drop

3609
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:15,744
To it's much like nitric oxide analysis beat pills

3610
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:18,048
Too much danger ye men

3611
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:18,816
CPA

3612
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:20,096
App

3613
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:23,680
It's not it's not something that they're there is an

3614
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:29,568
Unlimited it's an unlimited resource to use it sparingly absolutely

3615
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:30,592
Stances are exactly

3616
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:33,920
What times would you need a goddamn little burst of Lionel

3617
02:28:34,432 --> 02:28:35,200
So

3618
02:28:35,712 --> 02:28:37,760
We can wait until we come to the end and

3619
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:41,600
I guess we learned a lot yeah I think

3620
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:43,392
Alarm ground fault

3621
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:44,160
Lionel wants

3622
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:46,464
The murder people at Starbucks

3623
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:48,000
She allowed the

3624
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:48,768
A fuk about

3625
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,048
Blackface what is it

3626
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,072
Okay

3627
02:28:51,328 --> 02:28:52,608
So no nuance

3628
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,144
And if you report

3629
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,192
And something that ends up

3630
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:57,472
Stopping a bombing

3631
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:02,592
You will be in a Solera call yourself

3632
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:04,128
The f*** out of

3633
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,408
Alienstock

3634
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:07,712
Of course well yeah but that's just

3635
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:09,248
And your dick

3636
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:13,600
But also hey good for you if you like office Blues really confused about that one

3637
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:16,416
Still I'm not sure what is playing on

3638
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:18,464
Naked

3639
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:20,768
I was

3640
02:29:21,024 --> 02:29:22,048
Fair enough actually

3641
02:29:22,304 --> 02:29:22,816
I took

3642
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:24,608
So

3643
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:26,912

Absolutely I'll do as best we can to help each other

3646
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:33,056
Anza

3647
02:29:33,312 --> 02:29:35,104
Listen to the advice of

3648
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,920
People who are in much

3649
02:29:38,432 --> 02:29:38,944
Better position

3650
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:41,504
Provides advice for you

3651
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,272

3652
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:45,600
Just so everybody knows we're very very grateful to you for

3653
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:48,160
Yeah those of you donate

3654
02:29:49,184 --> 02:29:52,256
Play grateful we wouldn't be able to survive without that

3655
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:53,024
I mean

3656
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:53,792
Especially now

3657
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:55,328
Like all of this stuff

3658
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:56,096
Is

3659
02:29:56,608 --> 02:29:57,632
Entirely because

3660
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:59,168
People

3661
02:29:59,424 --> 02:29:59,936
Care

3662
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:01,216
And I-80

3663
02:30:01,472 --> 02:30:02,240
Feels amazing

3664
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:03,520
It overwhelmed

3665
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:11,968
It's not good bro I appreciate it is well and I was missing about this

3666
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:18,112
By yourselves cogitating on it as a contractor as Alex Republic

3667
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:18,880
You dance

3668
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:20,416
Motherfuker I see you

3669
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:21,952
I was thinking about this

3670
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:22,720
Like

3671
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:23,744
Maybe the other night

3672
02:30:24,768 --> 02:30:26,048
About how

3673
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,096
I left my job working

3674
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,888
Coffee distribution

3675
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:30,912
Company

3676
02:30:31,168 --> 02:30:32,960
To do this show

3677
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:34,752
At a time when no one's

3678
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:37,312
Almost nobody was listening

3679
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:40,384
No one supported the show it was really tough

3680
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:41,152
I did a lot of

3681
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:43,200
Very bad work

3682
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:44,480
Work-from-home type working

3683
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:45,504
Sold my blood

3684
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:46,784
In order to keep up

3685
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,808
With this and you were very

3686
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:48,832
Sported as well

3687
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:49,856
I we were able to make

3688
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:50,624
Make it work

3689
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:52,672
It was a huge

3690
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,440
Gamble

3691
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:54,208
What is stupid

3692
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,232
Did I win

3693
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:57,792
Advise anybody to do ever

3694
02:30:59,072 --> 02:30:59,584
Thermostats

3695
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:01,632
But we did that and it ended up

3696
02:31:01,888 --> 02:31:03,680
Leading to where we are now

3697
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:04,704
And

3698
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:06,496
It's overwhelming
