7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,104
Because just before we started recording you informed me that you've never been booed

8
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
I feel like after that indeed you got that stew people listening

9
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,000
I know you have announced

10
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768

11
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
But have you ever tried to repair a wrestling

12
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
What's a great professional

13
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,384
You are going to run a ad campaign

14
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,016
I did some in ring announcer guy turns out I'm not very good at that

15

16
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Bystander

17
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,328
That's not what you do

18
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
I'm not good at that

19
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,216
No I don't think so

20
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
Powerbomb my friends at the bean bags

21
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
Columbia Missouri

22
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,552
Borderline megachurch room full of bean bags

23
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
Some of the early

24
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
Early in the Church of development that's what they'd have the youth meeting

25
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
They're tons and tons of giant bean bags

26
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
You do like ddt's and power bombs

27
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Backyard wrestling

28
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Proto

29
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Office is like a text start up off as like a Google where it's like we're all sitting around

30
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Similarities

31
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
Feeling similarities

32
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,008
Watched

33
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,872
Hell in a Cell WWE pay-per-view and

34
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272

Is all f****** legal

37
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Is this what I did in a disqualification

38
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,664
Which is supposed to be exactly, to the rules

39
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
Let's just said no no no no no

40
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Read while I grew up watching like Triple H

41
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Scarier

42
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
This is ridiculous

43
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
So

44
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,167
Dissuade me from ever

45
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Actually doing

46
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
Bad taste in my mouth

47
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
I don't even watch that much wrestling anymore I just like randomly checked in on Sunday

48
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
Disaster

49
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Great

50
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Everybody is pretty well-versed in the wrestling

51
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,743
Match but also the meta games played above it on the underwriting lover

52
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,327
It seems like they have far more freedom to do whatever whatever they want

53
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
Ending in 2212 occasion of his cell match

54
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,495
Kayfabe

55
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
Is gone

56
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,967
Yeah it doesn't reducer like what was the decision

57
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
You you thought about that in advance

58
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
I guess

59
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,071
From the other night and I know a lot of it I was just

60
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399

One guy who works at a bus station as telescope

67
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,423
The roster is not good

68
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
I was going through it

69
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Albeit

Google call it's in the song

113
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,423
Without the real knowledge of what she was doing

114
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
I can't imagine

115
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359

Episode introduction

120
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
Hi I'm Cherry Castle

121
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
I carry

122
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
My latest

123
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Interview with

124
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Captain Mark

125
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
And I

126
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,823
Interviewed him in the beginning of September however I've had multiple

127
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
With both

128
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Computers

129
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
And

130
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Various

131
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Renditions

132
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Little Talks

133
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
And now I'm trying to

134
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
That's all

135
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
So here we go and help

136
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,303
So apparently she has recorded this couple times over

137
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
Visit Mark Richard maybe like a month ago or so and now she's finally being able to get this information out

138
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
And that's great

139
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,223
Every single time the Carrie comes back

140
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
From visiting Mark Richard

141
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,831
Recording audio

142
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
The

143
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,999
Prison people don't have a pen

144
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
But

145
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
She does get a small pencil

146
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
So what happened

147
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Only allowed app

148
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
This is called

149
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Total Recall

150
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
11

151
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
So what happens is

152
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
I go into the prison

153
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
And we have around

154
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
3 hours

155
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
Sometimes longer

156
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
I think this time

157
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
3 hours

158
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
I am able to

159
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
She asked him as many question

160
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Since as I

161
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
Although I'm not allowed

162
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
So

163
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
If I didn't remember

164
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
To ask

165
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
You requested

166
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
I do apologize

167
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,479
Some information baby see that that flow being

168
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
I think they probably confiscated

169
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
To talk to a cult leader of the murderer

170
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:23,167
You responded exactly as I

171
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Saturday

172
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
Huge jumps got there

173
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
This clearly Tech problems going on there's also like you'll see develop

174
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
He's just editing this very weirdly

175
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Broadcast

176
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,159
The cheese that she's putting out about that

177
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,815
But what's important is that Mark Richard is not a murderer

178
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
The court system

179
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Confessions of his conspirators

180
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
Spell all natural

181
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,871
And for everybody who hasn't heard all the mark Richards episodes here is Carrie's playing

182
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
In the beginning

183
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Want to save this

184
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:13,343
Text place in Solano Prison in Northern California

185
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
And

186
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
For over 35 years Captain Mark Richards

187
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Has been

188
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
And still is

189
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
A prisoner of war

190
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Are in the war

191
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Between on-and-off Planet races

192
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Have dominated Earth

193
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
For centuries

194
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
He is an honorable officer of the Navy

195
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Because of his

196
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Rebellion

197
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
Against the Draco

198
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
And

199
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Just called the loose

200
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Safari in Alliance

201
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Is considered a threat to their Opera

202
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,063
He was framed for murder he's accused of

203
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
I'm having Mastermind

204
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
While he was on a mission

205
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Send off planet

206
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
In service to humanity

207
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
He wasn't captain

208
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Starship Enterprise

209
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Vessel

210
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
From an very early age

211
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
In fact

212
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Probably early twenties

213
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
That

214
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Until he was

215
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Was arrested

216
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
I believe it was 19

217
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
As a master

218
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
Again he is frame for a murder

219
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
He is accused

220
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
Having masterminded while he was

221
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Is on a mission off-planet

222
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Humanity

223
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,303
You hear that that's just exactly repeating what you just said

224
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
Redoing

225
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
This what is going on

226
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
I have a big theory about that

227
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:41,151
She called the prison guards like zinus

228
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
I think that I don't think that's the case

229
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,231
Different pictures that we have over from what we started talking about

230
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Yeah I think so

231
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
She might believe

232
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
Some things like that I don't think that's the case

233
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
I think they

234
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
I think is just clunky editing

235
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
She is going to

236
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,823
Create

237
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
I do not

238
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
Keeps this speaker

239
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,271
Because there's

240
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
An instance of this later

241
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,903
Where she uses the wrong name for someone and then there's immediately jump cut

242
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
It's pretty clear to me that what's going on is that she's f****** up her script she's poorly editing the pieces

243
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
Together and then after the fact is inserting

244
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
An explanation for it

245
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
I feel like I can tell you that now cuz it's kind of implied

246
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
Visiting other interviews of hers bees like

247
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,087
High-level terrible presentation

248
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
The flip-flops

249
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
She says for this murder to do is all planted in service

250
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,351
Small paws

251
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
It's like this is just

252
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
Move this out

253
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:13,823
Text Kate to lack of care about the product you're putting

254
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,663
You know like if it's this bad

255
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,991
Jump cuts to the point where just anybody listening

256
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
This is only an hour long video of the long drive

257
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,655
Turn our 2121 measurement

258
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,263
The substance of what's going on

259
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
Into

260
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
I don't know this is the big deal

261
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455
But it takes up a bunch of overtime

262
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
And that is the cheetahs run into a super soldier

263
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
He has a

264
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Half brain

265
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
Harebrained idea

266
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
So the first

267
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Real topic

268
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Take that we discussed

269
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
Is the Randy Cramer City

270
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,655
Situation with revisiting the alien

271
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Black scenario

272
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
And I told

273
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
Mark briefly about that idea

274
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
And

275
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
Randy Cramer is

276
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
Super soldier

277
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
U.s. Marine

278
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
At the Young

279
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
With

280
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
Me and others

281
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,879
And hopefully that footage will be available

282
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
In the near

283
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,999
Fingers crossed

284
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
We got Randy Cramer who is this

285
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Mike Richards

286
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
It was a super Soldier come out

287
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Scenario

288
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
I will just explain it to you right now because it's really hard to put together from what Carrie say

289
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,367
The bottom line here is that she believes

290
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,439
That Kramer is coming out today

291
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
This conference

292
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Whatever speaking at cussing

293
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
Behalf of his military handlers

294
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
The idea of

295
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,959
Precipitating an alien false flag in order to force disclosure

296
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Okay

297
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Disclosure of alien existence

298
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,943
We need the world to understand that there's a battle going on

299
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Down the street over Lake Michigan right now there is a

300
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
Every storm battle

301
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Actually Spider-Man

302
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Probably

303
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Giant spider

304
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
Because that's the real world situation

305
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,383
Yellow the alien stuff however

306
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,503
The evil powers-that-be the globalists the New World Order the Illuminati

307
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,831
To disclose all of this stuff if it is disclosed

308
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
Humanity and population will learn that they've been hoarding all of the secret technology for themselves

309
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,071
Free energy all the miracle cure

310
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
I guess probably Alchemy

311
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Uno

312
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
So all this stuff is alien technology that they've stolen for themselves will be revealed

313
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
About on the street

314
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,991
Trying to keep this technology from us in order to peacefully

315
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Do this

316
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
Dayton Air

317
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
To have an alien false flag

318
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
They need to have a

319
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Speak

320
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,559
Version of aliens appearing in order to explain this technology being rolled out

321
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
Randy Cramer is coming out and saying that he's military handlers or whatever allowing him

322
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
Him to start talkin about the

323
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
It's convoluted right why even just playing clips of Kerry talked about this

324
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Okay

325
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
That's Randy Kramer's

326
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,111
Input into the process

327
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
The plans of their perceived enemies

328
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
There

329
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
It's stupid

330
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
I would feel betrayed if I found out that

331
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,703
Like f****** Nancy Pelosi has all kinds of

332
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Secret eggnog

333
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,615
Right there schemes to counters

334
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Are far more ridiculous on top of

335
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
The other two

336
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,463
Miracle cures that Randy Cramer talks

337
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,791
Right like Eternal youth that kind of thing

338
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
Why would David Rockefeller end up being like

339
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,959
A super unhealthy ninety-year-old dude if he had access to this

340
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
Life extension

341
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,615
Age regression technology

342
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Always

343
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,991
Occam's razor

344
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,879
This leads into talking about this situation a little bit more

345
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Audi

346
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
Kerry might not call it the globalist

347
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
They call it like

348
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Secret

349
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,352
Illuminati folks

350
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,168
They have all of this

351
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
The technology

352
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
This leads into like

353
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
The Dynamics of the disclosures

354
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,664
He was talking about the military

355
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Frustration

356
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
With our current standstill

357
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
On planet Earth

358
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
With regard to

359
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Disclosure

360
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
And the fact that they have

361
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
A very high state of

362
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Technology

363
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
In the secret

364
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Unable

365
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
2 releasing

366
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Into the public domain

367
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
In part because

368
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Disclosure

369
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Everything

370
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
More difficult

371
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
So what we have is a roast

372
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Zacian

373
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Which involves

374
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
U.s. military

375
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Secrets

376
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Program

377
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
The Illuminati

378
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
And various other factions

379
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Including

380
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Very safe

381
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
He races

382
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Short and

383
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Therefore they are

384
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Operating

385
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
Basically

386
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
What can even be considered

387
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
Be thousands

388
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Of what we are

389
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
None

390
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
So this is a big deal and

391
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Randy Cramer

392
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
Military are now

393
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Coming up

394
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
With a solution

395
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
It has to do with

396
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Revisiting this ID

397
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,480
False flag

398
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
Bluebeam of course

399
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
In the past

400
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Only people

401
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Or a fake

402
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
Alien invasion

403
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,560
So this is the solution here project

404
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
It comes up

405
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,472
Call the f****** time project maybe if you know things

406
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,544
Maybe if you're a researcher

407
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
It's one of the biggest most popular UFO conspiracy paranormal community

408
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,576
First thing that I should point out to you I think is very important about that project it's not a real thing

409
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:25,952
The name refers to a project Bona claimed exist

410
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,512
But no evidence to support the claim has ever been present

411
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
According to Montes

412
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
In order to New World Order

413
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
The bad guys first created New Age religion to replace the religion people currently subscribe to

414
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
It also seems like he's mostly interested in talking about the breaking down of Christianity resources

415
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:52,576
Christy other world religions

416
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
Christian

417
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,232
Destroy Christian whistleblower

418
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Sure sure

419
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
The primary focus destruction of

420
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Christianity

421
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:10,240
In order to achieve this goal they need to destroy these current religion switch

422
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
Specific sites around the world

423
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,128
Which ultimately Unearthed evidence that contradicts the known world religion

424
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
This'll be a dumb plant that's most religious belief is not based on empirical evidence and it isn't really susceptible

425
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:29,184
Career Point

426
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
Either way

427
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:39,168
What's this new world religion is in place the NWO venues hologram

428
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
Avatars of each religion

429
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
To the people in the areas where that religion is probably has the Buddha

430
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
Buddhist

431
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:57,856
I guess I throw a tree in for wiccans or something I don't know Daya

432
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:04,256
These avatars with emergent Grice

433
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,584
Whichever one with that worship but it's all just a trick it's all Holograms

434
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,240
Now that the public accept this new God the NWO would begin using electronic waves

435
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,544
I to begin projecting thoughts into

436
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
The people's heads

437
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,872
Making them think that God is talking to them

438
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,968
This would facilitate their ultimate goal which is making everyone think that a real crisis

439
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:30,112
In the form of an impending Alien Invasion or the Rapture whatever formation I detect

440
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
The people will be so scared that they would beg for the implementation of the New World Order and just like that the one world government isn't

441
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
Easy as riding a riding a bike

442
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,008
Everything goes according to plan

443
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,944
00, States along the way

444
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,344
Machine of a silly plan there a lot of really dumb parts and probably too many to count

445
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,672
Go to be set to motion

446
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
Incorrectly a lot of July

447
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,304
Analogous tikli stupidest plan is

448
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,936
Alex Jones definitely believe that Project Blue beam

449
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,032
Okay but he's smart enough not to talk about it because he knows if he does

450
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
He's going to look like a f***

451
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
Stupid space weirdo

452
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
First thing

453
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
I would definitely believe the globalist attracted

454
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
Destroy Christianity in order to have their own religion

455
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
You said this a bunch of time

456
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,392
Whether it's in the formula saying is the new religion or

457
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,744
Sometimes it is political correctness for the globalist

458
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
To trying to get rid of these religions

459
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Because they're a threat

460
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
Like

461
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
The ability to the New World Order

462
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:52,544
Follows very closely with this project

463
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,872
Templar that religions are

464
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Pesky

465
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,016
Suppose plan follows almost exactly the Hungarian dialectic

466
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,344
Problem reaction solution

467
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
The globalist Opera

468
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,512
They can only take power by creating chaos which they then provide a solution

469
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,328
That sort of thing really fits with Alex's

470
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
Conception

471
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,216
Everything in this Theory matches up with things that Alex believe

472
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
The UN is behind the plan

473
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,824
It involves destroying National sovereignty

474
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
It involves making

475
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
All money electronic

476
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
It involves the destruction of the family unit

477
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,760
It involves camps for people who won't accept a new world order

478
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,344
Involves the human sacrifice specifically of Christian children

479
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,744
It involves the literal devil being behind the New World Order Hidden Falls movies and television shows preparing

480
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,376
World for the rollout of plant predictive programming there's heavy overlap

481
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,680
There's one other aspect

482
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,776
Maybe there's one other aspect of this that makes me suspect Alex believe this

483
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,432
Most of the people who believe in this area are basing their belief on a 1994 lecture given by surge Mana

484
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
One small point about this lecture

485
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
It's only available as a transfer

486
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
Published on educate yourself. Org

487
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
Hey bad news about this

488
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,720
In the middle of the lecture the editor of the site interrupt

489
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,888
At this point interrupting the transcript I'm compelled to include three statements from the protocols of the Elders of Zion

490
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,384
Effort to reinforce this bonnet

491
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,784
Geico claims

492
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
Run by the Jews

493
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
How could we imagine that they weren't behind

494
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,584
In the lecture modest argues that the plan was originally to start this plan up in 1980s

495
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
Ultimately bringing in the New World Order the next year which explains floor Wells book 1984

496
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
Right

497
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,456
Yes it's like there was a 1994 and you know what that means

498
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
The globalist are 10 years

499
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
Behind on their plans

500
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,768
The Alex is so consistent

501
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:26,656
Like how we randomly just says that they're 10 years behind with no citation or explanation for what he's talking about

502
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:31,520
Hey my specific sources that I've been able to find that Alex is referenced in other contexts

503
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,128
I can't find any real concrete instances of people saying the globalist plans or 10 years behind

504
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:42,528
This lecture about Project Blue beam is very explicit about exactly that

505
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Not necessarily

506
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
But it's a possibility

507
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
This very bizarre element

508
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
Is Project Blue beam was 10 years behind very explicitly

509
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
I don't know

510
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,056
Manny this is right around 1 Alex started his radio career

511
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
We're going to get coincidences

512
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
And maybe maybe could just be ozmosis like he's aware of these space weirdo

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,144
It's entirely possible it's just a coincidence and a lot of people have ideas about the bad guys being 10 years.

514
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,336
Listing of Project Blue beam of the time of the government

515
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,688
Consider using an alien.

516
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,760
I know she's learned that super soldier Randy Cramer

517
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
Very real military cohorts

518
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:52,416
Using the same tricks to force the government to disclosure

519
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,304
So the be forced to release all the secret technology they can keep themselves using the nwos plan against

520
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
Newt New World Order

521
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,216
The first two problems that come up here are what

522
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
Kramer's going to be

523
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
Faking It

524
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
He doesn't have the resources

525
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,688
Planning skills creativity

526
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
Definition

527
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,904
People have actually been able to trace down where Serge monast got his ideas from

528
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
Okay world order was supposedly going to be carrying out where all elements of an unproduced

529
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,400
Describe the Gene Roddenberry had written in 1975

530
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,960
In a first attempt at making Star Trek into a movie

531
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,080
The script unreleased 1975 when he had written it Niger

532
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:47,456
But in 1994 just prior to bonnist coming out with his lecture in Revelation

533
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,320
Joe langel had written a book called Gene Roddenberry the myth in The Man Behind Star Trek

534
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,648
Which included a bunch of information about the Shelf project

535
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,000
Never made into a movie back in 1975

536
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:06,400
Many elements of the original script were used in the 1991 Star Trek the Next Generation episode The Devil's Due

537
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,472
Which also predates modest conspiracy theory

538
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
All of this comes from

539
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
Picard

540
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,760
This is a Hostess raspberry chip

541
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Of course

542
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:30,208
Really highly rated episode like more

543
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
Dancehall Soca

544
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Just about like

545
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
Captain Picard

546
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
Get into like

547
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,656
Legal arbitration against Amalia

548
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Yeah

549
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
Blue BBQ zazen

550
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
Example is first of all just like

551
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
I mean I love it

552
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,344
I love it

553
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,928
Purdue speedrun

554
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
That was very much like

555
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
Star Trek

556
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,632
Starship

557
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,192
Enterprise like crap

558
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
Never

559
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,544
Never surprising to me how little effort or imagination

560
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,528
Communities in paranormal communities have called this out about

561
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,928
Need to go to Skeptics site to find the information about Project Blue beam to people rip off from Star Trek

562
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Site

563
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:40,352
They even discredit this s*** people who are on

564
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,984
Closer to the up-and-up people who are a little bit more critical of information or like

565
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
There's no way

566
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,080
Didn't take this from that

567
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,456
May just not possible information was out there

568
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
There's a really good chance

569
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
That he had seen

570
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,832
The Next Generation episode

571
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,696
Maybe read the angles book and just incorporate it into a theory

572
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
So

573
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
I don't know

574
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Stupid

575
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,840
Astral projection

576
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,424
Gene roddenberry's house

577
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
Exactly

578
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Exact

579
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,664
Even if you bring up and point out all this

580
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
Gene Roddenberry

581
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
That would be in a Star Trek episode

582
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,464
Need to prepare the world.

583
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
Silver dollar trap

584
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,584
We're trying to pull a false flag Independence

585
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,632
What's going on

586
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
More or less

587
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,240
So that's great and that'll come back up

588
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Reappears

589
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
Of course is Randy Cramer coming out with salt

590
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Information

591
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Before we get back to that

592
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
We have some more information

593
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
From Mark

594
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
Okay

595
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
Is another Tran

596
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,416
That I'm seeing more and more of these interviews

597
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
And that is

598
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
Try to take

599
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,400
Okay and I think you do a great disservice

600
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
To reality

601
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
The idea here is that

602
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
Hidden War

603
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
Are also

604
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
So he can buy

605
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
Fires in California

606
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
2 years

607
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,760
We had fires in northern and southern

608
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Simultaneously

609
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
In the month

610
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Last year

611
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
20

612
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
18

613
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
2070

614
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
We're coming up on the firestick

615
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Season again this year

616
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:56,032
So you got these fires that are largely the result of climate change

617
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,848
And and

618
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Yeah yeah

619
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,944
Dealing with that in a real way

620
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,272
Solutions

621
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,600
You pretend that they're just cover-ups for alien invasion

622
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
That's

623
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
A real trend

624
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
They were going to see

625
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
Not just in relation to climate stuff

626
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:21,632
But in terms of any kind of geopolitical issue everything is just

627
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,728
Does kind of enforces of complacency on people

628
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Because if

629
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,872
If in reality all of the world issues are really just covering up alien invasion

630
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
What can you do

631
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
Other than

632
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
Tell us about the alien

633
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,344
There's nothing else you could really do there are avenues for productive change

634
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
Based on that everything is going great

635
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:50,048
There isn't International conflict All in This Together

636
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,448
Problem

637
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
Sure is there any way for us to broadcast

638
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
Our show to perhaps

639
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,432
Drake

640
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
I don't think they'd listen

641
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,832
That's how we could make our show you and me we could make

642
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,416
The difference in this f******

643
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:23,072
We could have our own little Yalta Conference

644
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:29,472
My house burned down like 10 years ago

645
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
Apologize

646
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
Okay

647
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
Thunderstorm

648
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
Absolutely

649
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
So are we get back

650
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
To the false flag

651
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,904
Alien false flag scenario here conference with Randy

652
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Where she got to ask

653
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Question

654
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
She is not thrilled with some of

655
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Randy is

656
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Responses

657
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,424
I challenge

658
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Randy Cramer

659
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
And that

660
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Created some

661
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
To do because Randy

662
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Was not happy

663
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
The challenge

664
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
And

665
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
Actually we parted.

666
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
Friends Joey

667
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
It was all in

668
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
Really

669
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Positive

670
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Light

671
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
What kind of

672
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Alien

673
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
Shoes

674
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
How's my first question

675
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
She keeps asking

676
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,760
Indoraptor indoraptor

677
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:51,904
It's it's all about doing to protect her

678
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Friendly alien races military people that the Raptors shall not be used at this post Library

679
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:10,848
Performance

680
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,992
Look I know you're on your Griff Time on My Grave

681
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,528
Is great

682
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,392
But in reality

683
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,232
It seems like that might be the case

684
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:31,328
Although a Q&A session during the conference is still kind of performance time

685
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:37,728
No that's what I'm saying that's the feeder that there is

686
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
There is any actual

687
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,384
Behind-the-scenes self-reporting

688
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,152
Exact

689
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Still all could be

690
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
To an extent performance

691
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Positively

692
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh I'm sure

693
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
There's only so much arguing you can do about imaginary thing eventually you're either going to fight or be like

694
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
Drink

695
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
Calm down

696
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Whatever

697
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,176
I took this took place at the yelma conference

698
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
Carrie keep saying

699
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:29,440
The first 45 times she brought it up but Alma Powell

700
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
Yelm

701
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Okay

702
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,144
A bunch of times

703
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
Thoroughly

704
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
You know

705
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
I figured

706
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:49,152
Initially that's like okay it's probably a bunch of space weirdos they rented out a hotel conference room what the f*** ever

707
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,736
But it wasn't never heard before

708
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
Started 2017

709
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
As an offshoot of the Yelp

710
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,928
Tell Danielle population

711
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
6800

712
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:07,840
I watch the promotional videos of the Uso fast and it's mostly people setting up booths to sell alien t-shirt

713
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,888
And some absurd musical performance

714
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Why people interrupt

715
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,032
Commercial Enterprise mixed with a state

716
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
Fair kind of entitlement

717
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
Barbie puzzle bobble heads and if you just imagine a state fair but it

718
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,464
Yeah that I got and it's an assessment born out by a number of Articles from local

719
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:44,448
Yeah

720
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:52,128
There's like people who do art like alien themed art for sale on site.

721
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
Good time

722
00:41:54,175 --> 00:42:00,319
The UFO Fester's free since they want families to come in and enjoy the food vendors and weird

723
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,879
Highest number

724
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
Possible

725
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
Potential customers for the alien merch vendors

726
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Symposium

727
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
The conference

728
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Is not free

729
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,335
An article in the Daily Chronicle from 2017 put the price of tickets at $250 for a 3

730
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
3-day pass to the symposium

731
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
Okay

732
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
What are the spiders

733
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,551
That year in 2017 was a woman named JZ Knight

734
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:36,415
Who claims chicken channel 35 thousand-year-old Warrior Spirit named Ramsey

735
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,255
A large number of followers because of this

736
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,071
She's also dropped the blueprint for

737
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:49,471
Education center has described nights

738
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,055
The group as fulfilling main requirements

739
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
Destructive cult

740
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
We should start

741
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:02,783
The splc 2014 on videos of some of her lectures to her followers that include her saying things like

742
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
The following

743
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
Quote

744
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,111
God's chosen people

745
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,415
I think hard enough cash tip

746
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:13,791
I think they've earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamn gas Chambers by now

747
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,375
Yeah

748
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,079
She still invited to speak at this Cosmic Symposium three years after this came out

749
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:32,735
Also earlier this year night tried to reach out to the community by saying that he was a Divine intelligence

750
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,039
This isn't surprising basic level

751
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:40,159
If a cult leader knows anything it's how to identify vulnerable populations for potential followers

752
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,535
People are the biggest game in town on that level right now

753
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:50,655
Who is a cult leader video later absolutely

754
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,263
Essence of H Guiding Light

755
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
They're ripe

756
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:02,431
Different directions

757
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,223
Sweep that s*** up and up

758
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,063
Very important to pay attention to

759
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
Isn't it amazing that you can

760
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,951
Steve these other parasitic cult leaders like literally tried

761
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
Find like the Giant

762
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:22,655
Section that's so wild that these people are so dumb

763
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
Mq2 this

764
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:30,335
Call it or call it in a bad place life possibly vulnerable

765
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
Look my parents were in a cult I know how you

766
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:38,527
You get into Vault herbal is a better way to put a conversation.

767
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:43,391
And a lot of people are in a circumstance in their life make them

768
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
Are the

769
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
Victims of the

770
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,143
Malicious Act

771
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
Not presume to judge

772
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
Is it best I can

773
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
I agree with you

774
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
First cult

775
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:11,551
But if you start at 1 and then jump over baby

776
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
No Maybe

777
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
That would be nice

778
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,351
But also it doesn't always work in the way where someone going to call and then it become completely disillusioned

779
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
They go from

780
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:31,775
Sometimes I think like this was right but something was wrong let me resign this

781
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Another one

782
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
Part of one almost makes you more prone

783
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,991
Vulnerable

784
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:46,879
I wish it was the case that all of this was rational choice

785
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
100%

786
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
The people who are

787
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,911
Being targeted by her get a little bit more

788
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,959
Empathy

789
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:06,591
I mean like I said videos of her yelling

790
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,431
Came out in 2014 she was invited to the 2017

791
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Y'all

792
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:16,575
Conference Cosmic Symposium somebody weight

793
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,415
What are the standards by which

794
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
This conference

795
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,023
If they allow someone like who's running a destructive

796
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,071
Very strong anti-Semitic

797
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:32,447
That's not just someone who channels a f****** alien

798
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
Ill-will

799
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
And they're still like

800
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:42,431
Sorry 2018 the festival's cut down to a two-day event the Earth UFO Festival

801
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:47,807
$150 for full access to the symposium

802
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,695
Don't really announces the lineup for this thing

803
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:00,095
Of this conference on her website

804
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
And this year

805
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
She was there along with Randy Cramer

806
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:08,543
But also Mark Richards wife Joanne was they have course

807
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823

Simon Park

809
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
And there is a

810
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Suspicious

811
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:22,367
All right. Duke on there I don't know what I don't know what that was about

812
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,439
I look a little deeper my founded in 2018

813
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
Last year Carrie was there too

814
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,839
She was there I got two years in a row that you're

815
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:38,239
3 hour time slot on Saturday which is well along

816
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:44,639
That must have got enough you know who else

817
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
Jordan sather

818
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:51,551
Denoted qanon promoter who's involved with that whole let's drink bleach thing earlier this year

819
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,879
Festival only book in the top people

820
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
Weird

821
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:03,583
Both speakers

822
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,399
There's a heavy heavy overlap in The rosters

823
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Puregear

824
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,239
Yeah UFO Fest

825
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,567
Facebook page to find the lineup for the first year in 2017

826
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
What can't what

827
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,175
Simon parkes and Randy Cramer there that you're too

828
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,759
He's been there every year okay

829
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:27,647
I don't think so at least not in the official announcement

830
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
But get that

831
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:35,327
Also in 2017 you know who else was there

832
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:41,727
Enlisted as a child to go on teleporting missions to Mars with a young kid would grow up to be President Barack Obama

833
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
Can breathe underwater

834
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,247
Which fuse run for president in 2020

835
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,807
I need the I need this clarified

836
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:01,183
Where is Scotland

837
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,487
Hyphen dolphin not have

838
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,767
Dolphin hyphen Warrior

839
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,679
No not have a man who as I recalled

840
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:18,079
Call from listening to an interview

841
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:24,223
Bermuda Triangle there's a base down there and because he is half dolphin and can breathe underwater

842
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:30,623
He is able to swim down there

843
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Years ago from now

844
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Hey why he was there the first year

845
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,791
Okay I'm getting out of this conference looks like s***

846
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
It's an offshoot of a state fair ass UFO Festival

847
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:50,079
Regardless of whether or not they're completely mentally unstable regardless of whether or not their cult leaders

848
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,639
There's a lot of lame UFOs symposium

849
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
But honestly this once

850
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,479
Balalaika

851
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,599
Kramer putting out his UFO false flag

852
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
Scenario

853
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
Western

854
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
No I don't

855
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:11,071
You don't even think it's all up to the field man

856
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
Oh I got an awesome cool I would like to go to it I would pay for the supposed

857
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Fries

858
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
I'm sorry I would assume

859
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,087
Sneaker

860
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,927
So are we back to this and talk some more about this

861
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
This false flag strategy

862
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,791
Close

863
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,631
You'll see what I was talking about earlier why I think she's editing

864
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
Cricket in the middle of this

865
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,471
She calls Randy Rahn

866
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,079
Clearly here that's exactly where the edit happened

867
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
I did talk about

868
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
This

869
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Dichotomy

870
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
And why

871
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
They would have

872
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Disclosure

873
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
Obviously

874
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
They don't want

875
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
Lynch Mob

876
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
To come forward

877
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
When

878
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
Things like

879
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Free energy

880
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Bedrock

881
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
The result

882
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
Disclosure

883
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
And

884
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
That this kind of

885
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Create

886
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,055
A great deal of

887
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
After

888
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
Lakewood

889
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
After which

890
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
Trot out

891
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Free energy

892
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Commercial

893
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Travel

894
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,535
The fact that they

895
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
Interstellar

896
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,119
There's so many ways to edit better than this

897
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
Why do you say that

898
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:01,919
Leaving in Ron

899
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
You can just be like

900
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:11,903
Sorry super simple

901
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:18,303
Seemed to imply that maybe she said something

902
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,423
Screaming obscenities

903
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,567
I don't know it's just very clear based on things like that

904
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,783
You kind of 300 whatever there's these jumps it's probably because there was some problem with the original recording

905
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,879
She's not good enough editing or production

906
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
You just like

907
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,999
You do another take and that you make it obvious that there's a second tag

908
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:53,119
Jump cut in the middle of the episode

909
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,703
Getting to be an issue and she has no real explanation for it

910
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
There is

911
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,543
We're drop frames

912
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
Happening with me

913
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,871
Don't know why

914
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,943
In this recording so I apologize for

915
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
For that

916
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,271
And you will see it periodically

917
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
Convenient that he's dropped frames

918
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
You know just

919
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,255
That's just like when you build an audience like that

920
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,047
We're looking into

921
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
What is clearly just

922
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:28,447
I'm sitting at edited

923
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Or

924
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,751
Next.

925
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,359
Living in a reality that is cutting

926
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,599
And maybe like 10 minutes later

927
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
Reality itself is glitching

928
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:51,743
The only thing that I can buy

929
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Probably

930
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,559
And I do want to say that

931
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,143
My

932
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
In a very strange

933
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
Disconnected

934
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
Because of the drop

935
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
Frame issue

936
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,151
But it's not really a drop frame

937
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
Microphone

938
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
Connected

939
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,367
Happening is

940
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Internet

941
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
Interfering

942
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Computer

943
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Trying to

944
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,983
This interview

945
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
So please

946
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,407
Some kind of

947
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
It may be the

948
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
The military

949
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
Is shooting

950
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
Could

951
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
Sure

952
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,695
4 on the other

953
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
Absolutely

954
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,031
When she said it just

955
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:14,431
Could be I really thought she was going to say it just could be some sort of a processing issue

956
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,479
I knew for a new there was 02

957
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:22,879
Aliens

958
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:29,023
Hey look I don't really know this computer super well yet it's brand new

959
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:34,399
I don't know maybe the settings aren't set totally right there's all kinds of like

960
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
Little

961
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:41,055
Venusian through our recording

962
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,151
Different recording Serta paradigms

963
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,455
Set up over the course of doing the show

964
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,343
And especially when we switched from me playing the clips from my phone to doing it straight from the computer

965
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,487
There were a ton of little slip-up could have very easily been like Alex doing a DDOS attack on us

966
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:04,863
Technology you're not used to whatever system you're using or

967
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,399
By whatever don't like

968
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,983
I don't understand for bravado like that

969
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,519
I will tell you this 100

970
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,335
Percent here was my thought as she was going through that

971
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:19,199
Something's interfering with my new computer as I get to new computer

972
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
No

973
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Champ

974
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,551
Inhale you will even acknowledge that that

975
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,087
Could be the possibility

976
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,135
Note

977
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
More Furious

978
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,815
At the great fishing isn't the fact that she doesn't know how to use that way

979
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:40,959
It is a window into how this thought process

980
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:44,543
Everything is an indication of what you wanted

981
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,847
Every single damn thing

982
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Fits into the

983
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,943
Pre-constructed narrative the yardi have

984
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,783
I'm having a difficult time getting this episode together because I keep

985
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
Miss speaking or

986
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,183
This program glitches and I'm not totally sure how to use it yet

987
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Pulse weapon attack

988
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
Yep

989
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
Throw up

990
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,887
Wonder if that eliminates

991
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,215
Like you know how

992
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
You have that moment

993
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,799
Suddenly

994
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:22,943
For some reason you've just lost the remote control

995
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
And you can't find it

996
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Curious

997
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
There's no reason

998
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:34,207
That you can't find this remote control it's such a petty silly thing

999
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Everyday

1000
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,047
Pictures of bad I am as a person

1001
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,399
She doesn't have that she's just like

1002
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Alright

1003
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,727
I'll get a new remote

1004
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:50,335
I suspect they're still the same anger directed aliens

1005
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:57,247
I don't think this is like sort of frees you up to be easy about the frustration

1006
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
His wife

1007
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,319
It's just shut off self

1008
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,647
Honcho

1009
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,999
Punching a wall and I will

1010
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:14,399
If I ever agree I will punch

1011
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:20,799
I don't think I appreciate what you're suggesting

1012
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:27,199
Were the case then maybe I would recommend being a therapeutic

1013
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,247
Don't think that's the case okay

1014
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
So you can meditate on

1015
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,367
You can believe that

1016
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
Choose your

1017
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,463
Option

1018
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
So

1019
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
We get back to Randy

1020
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
And now

1021
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,631
So so far alien

1022
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,679
False-flag disclosure

1023
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
Okay

1024
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,407
This is probably about

1025
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,943
2/3 mark

1026
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
1/3

1027
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,039
But the stuff is a little bit more

1028
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
Bingo

1029
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Like you know

1030
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,951
There's an actual conference brought a project blue beam

1031
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,743
There's more things

1032
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,535
Butt cheek

1033
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
She now kind of

1034
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,423
Makes the conspiracy out of this there might

1035
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,471
Randy Cramer might be working across

1036
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Purposes

1037
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
A little bit

1038
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,543
Sheetz

1039
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
Suspicion

1040
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,895
Now it is also important to realize

1041
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
In this scenario

1042
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
Idea forward

1043
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
Through

1044
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,647
To this very alternative group in Yelm

1045
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,695
Which is a very small

1046
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
And

1047
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,279
Disseminate

1048
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
Too cute

1049
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
Humans certain

1050
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Amount of

1051
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,031
Trickle down into the alternative community

1052
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
And so that those p

1053
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
During the battles with

1054
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,151
Aliens that are actually real

1055
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,711
Would be putting out the ideas

1056
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,015
So that

1057
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,575
There would be some cooler heads

1058
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,135
Putting the doubt

1059
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,183
This is again an Illuminati

1060
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
But

1061
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
On the other hand

1062
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,167
When in reality

1063
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,543
I don't even care

1064
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,079
This is the first time

1065
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,383
Where I've been angry at her

1066
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,783
For coming up with the things that I would have said to mock her without stupid this planet I just

1067
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,599
You want to say

1068
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,695
Throw your hands up

1069
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
Double Bluff

1070
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,119
And then we'll move on Illuminati is getting

1071
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Brandy

1072
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
Say this stuff

1073
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,471
In order to hip

1074
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,543
Some real cool people

1075
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,663
Right order to be there when a real alien invasion happens to say a

1076
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Man

1077
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,439
I just I can't hang

1078
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
You've ever

1079
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:25,887
Remarkable about it is that there is an element of this that is like really it's

1080
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,007
But it's good critical thinking

1081
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:35,359
Do you know what your terms of it being what are the possibilities

1082
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:41,759
You know you can secure in the fact they're talking about a fake alien

1083
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,343
Considering I got the motivation

1084
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
For saying app

1085
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:52,511
Like the fact that she's taking it that far into like alright maybe it's right

1086
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:58,911
Fake sincere that half-ass Pewaukee

1087
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,239
At least exercise down

1088
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Should walk with him

1089
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,127
Yeah it doesn't lead you the right place though crazy

1090
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,759
It's misdirected critical thinking

1091
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,831
Almost

1092
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:22,975
Even more even it's heartening in a way that is more disheartening that I could ever be

1093
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Is that

1094
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,047
Through our time with Carrie

1095
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
She has become

1096
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,679
More critically thinking

1097
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,239
The problem is

1098
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,775
She is applied it to

1099
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
Even more insane ideas

1100
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:42,687
She used the most

1101
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:48,575
Credulous person that could be happy just believe everything

1102
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,159
Grown as a person only to become more paranoid

1103
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,023
When you're asking these questions like what's more likely

1104
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,839
Is it real life more likely that Randy Cramer is being

1105
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:06,495
Or that he's been put up to it by the Illuminati in order to do this right right

1106
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:12,895
What you doing is also excluded another possibility of s***

1107
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,199
That's the part of the

1108
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:21,855
Incredulous credulous Spectrum

1109
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:29,023
Exercising critical thinking is flawed

1110
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Because

1111
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
Compared to

1112
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:37,727
This is a real suggestion of a false flag or it's a psyop or whatever

1113
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,519
I'm not sure which one of those is more likely

1114
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:46,175
Either is more likely than the other

1115
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:54,879
And critically be like well here's this is all this is bulshit repair

1116
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:03,071
So you're you're failing on a critical thinking level if you don't this all doesn't make sense it's all stupid

1117
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
You have nothing to prove any of this

1118
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
What

1119
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
We used

1120
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,775
Occam's razor

1121
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Subway

1122
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
And that would be

1123
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
He is right

1124
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:22,271
You're absolutely right if you have that if you have those has two choices

1125
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
Ed you have to

1126
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,319
To choose one

1127
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:30,719
Is more or less likely

1128
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,999
None of this

1129
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
Then

1130
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
That it makes sense

1131
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
2

1132
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,119
Operate in a critical

1133
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:44,287
Way of the options that are available your just exclude another option

1134
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,895
Brandy I want to talk about him a little bit

1135
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,967
I got mansion in the first episode

1136
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,527
I'll Project Camelot super soldier

1137
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,367
Young man

1138
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,695
Whereupon he

1139
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,719
This

1140
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,839
Contradicted either being absolutely on Earth during those years

1141
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
Don't be so naive

1142
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:16,031
He was fighting

1143
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
It all makes sense

1144
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:26,015
I'm saying this for the listeners Who episode

1145
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,039
The timeline

1146
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Absolutely

1147
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:33,439
What was the push to release the holographic regenerating Medved

1148
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,743
You swore that the secret space program has

1149
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:42,655
There's a secret technology that doesn't want you

1150
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
To know about it

1151
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,823
Very suspicious

1152
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
The idea that the man doesn't want people to know about this stuff seems contradicted by the fact that Randy's been going on radio show

1153
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:04,159
Technology

1154
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:04,927
InstaCare

1155
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,999
He also had a GoFundMe running to develop

1156
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,559
Help Humanity

1157
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,703
Thousand dollars to save Humanity from all disease

1158
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
And of course age

1159
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,495
Regret

1160
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:22,335
Really basically has found the Fountain of Youth

1161
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,127
More people would realize

1162
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
Eternal life

1163
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:32,319
GoFundMe has been up since February 27th

1164
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:38,975
How's it going $7,300 raise crowdfunding

1165
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:45,375
Efforts are usually look up for people like this I think one of the reasons

1166
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
Putting people's hope and Desperation

1167
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,239
As you can clearly see you read some of the comments

1168
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,519
People leave on the page

1169
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,567
One donor said quote

1170
01:06:54,847 --> 01:07:00,991
My father needs a Medved soon he will go to heaven in a few months but the RV is very soon we

1171
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,855
Or there's another donor

1172
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
Please hurry

1173
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,951
My hubby has Ms and is bedridden

1174
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:14,047
If there's any kind of list to get on for treatment at cetera please let me know

1175
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
People need solution

1176
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:20,191
And when things are desperate they'll also be more inclined to turn to more irrational salute

1177
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,007
A person may be holding against stealing

1178
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:27,359
But they'll resort to it

1179
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
Similarly if your dad or husband is a

1180
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,479
A condition that conventional medicine doesn't have them

1181
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,039
Solutions for it's hard to just give up on them

1182
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:38,111
It's not uncommon for medical grifters to step in

1183
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,903
I tried to offer false hope

1184
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
For a price

1185
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
These methods do not exist

1186
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,791
High-functioning

1187
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:52,447
I wish some billionaire would come along be like you need 70 grand here you go now it's me the f****** bed.

1188
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,615
Every project

1189
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
B******* you have

1190
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
Is fully funded now

1191
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:08,575
Yeah put up or shut up

1192
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:14,975
Okay I'm filing charges against you for fraud

1193
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:20,095
Defrauded all of these people giving you any money

1194
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
If this is

1195
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,911
Like it should be

1196
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,703
Insanely Criminal

1197
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,751
Like this is so gross

1198
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:31,359
100% is a powerful

1199
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:34,687
With all that money

1200
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
We don't want your

1201
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:42,367
Do that

1202
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,999
People refusing

1203
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:51,071
To debate people they know will destroy them activate

1204
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,935
Not you

1205
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
Crowder

1206
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,943
But the other thing is that like

1207
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:13,343
The other option is so like built into their world you already that is like

1208
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:20,511
And then it's from the reptile

1209
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:25,375
Explanations for why you can't do it

1210
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
This is just

1211
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
Custom

1212
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:31,519
I don't care if you collecting this money this 7grand or whatever

1213
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,823
From this disco font

1214
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
I don't give a fuk

1215
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:39,711
He is making money off this doing these these speech circuit

1216
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,295
Even if he's not making any money

1217
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831
He still hurting people

1218
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,111
It gets just

1219
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,135
F****** disgusting

1220
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,719
And a one of those guys who and we listen to it seems like

1221
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,839
Episode

1222
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
It's the

1223
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,911
These people are hurting

1224
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
People

1225
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:07,615
Understand I am fine in American history

1226
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,151
Is a certain kind of

1227
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,735
Romantic concept of the grifter

1228
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
Yeah I know

1229
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,767
Dumb rich people are no smarter than anybody else

1230
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
And they're going to get

1231
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,815
Can for 100 grand

1232
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,351
F*** you you learned your lesson

1233
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
But these guys

1234
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
Is our bottom

1235
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
Reading lights

1236
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
I am going to

1237
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,007
To take this this dude last

1238
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
Cuz I want to

1239
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
10 bucks

1240
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
And that's it

1241
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
F*** off

1242
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,967
And one of the most effective way to do that is to

1243
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,575
Like an invading people's space who are struggling

1244
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,111
Especially if it's metal

1245
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
The worst part

1246
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
Was even with a

1247
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,863
The goddamn

1248
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,655
F****** placebo effect

1249
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,751
At least at least that much

1250
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,567
This medbed bulshit with just

1251
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,663
F****** sending him fifty bucks for his

1252
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,223
There's no sudden

1253
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
Placebo effect for a medvedeff never

1254
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:26,463
You might be a little more optimistic or hopeful but that's not going to do anything

1255
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,487
Calculate gross

1256
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,767
It's legit

1257
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
Disembark stuff

1258
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,655
Done with the business

1259
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,215
Next clip

1260
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,263
We get into how

1261
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,287
There's a bunch of aliens

1262
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
But

1263
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:48,223
Humanity

1264
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,783
And the kind of want better property

1265
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,575
They don't like being in the desert

1266
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,415
We're putting aliens on reservation

1267
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,487
Yeah that's heavily implied but they want

1268
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,511
Better

1269
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:06,399
Aliens

1270
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
W

1271
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,239
To be on the beach

1272
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,287
Marcus Point Theater

1273
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
With regard to Olive

1274
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
She says

1275
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,151
The military is stealing

1276
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
Real multiple

1277
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
Invasion

1278
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:25,087
Getting harder and harder

1279
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
To hide from public

1280
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,023
They're interested in

1281
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Pushing

1282
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
Time

1283
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,863
She also stressed

1284
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:37,887
Various race

1285
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,239
Environment

1286
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,543
And what access to our

1287
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
And more watery area

1288
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,383
They want to live on the beach

1289
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:54,527
Totally

1290
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
I can

1291
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,111
100% relate with I would rather be on

1292
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
Coast

1293
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:06,303
Or maybe situation we're in Commerce and I-10

1294
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:12,703
Under our capitalist system on airport is a very lucrative business

1295
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,239
Maybe they just wanted better

1296
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
View map

1297
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
Desert

1298
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,127
Blues Brother

1299
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
Great

1300
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:29,855
Sand looking out at the water

1301
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,671
Bright

1302
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:39,071
That's great they want kind of a part of another that happens first of all there's the

1303
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,911
Disclosure

1304
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,495
Then there is the rationalizing away any kind of like

1305
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,031
Geopolitical issues

1306
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,591
I meant also visit

1307
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,383
New strain that I'm seeing

1308
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,407
Of Mark

1309
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
Talking about like aliens being

1310
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Expansion

1311
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,063
Like they are not satisfied being in the desert they want to be on the coast

1312
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,135
Bissell pop-up a number of other time

1313
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,439
I'm not a hundred percent sure

1314
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:11,583
Exactly what this is code for code for something

1315
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,375
As we go along

1316
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,799
Yeah we talked about predictive programing a little bit already the idea that like movies and TV rights TV shows

1317
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
Repair people

1318
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
When Carrie gets into that

1319
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
Suggested

1320
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,319
Ready Player One

1321
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
Ender's Game

1322
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
Halo series

1323
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
There is

1324
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:44,863
Alien

1325
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
Sektor

1326
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,703
What About Last Starfighter lady

1327
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
And this scene

1328
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,223
To be preparing them

1329
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,503
4

1330
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,807
Alien invasion

1331
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,599
So

1332
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,879
I suggested that

1333
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
Grey alien

1334
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
Achoo

1335
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,951
There's too many races

1336
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
Anime

1337
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,119
You know there are good

1338
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,399
A grey alien

1339
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,423
Other

1340
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,447
Version

1341
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Grey aliens

1342
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,871
Different sizes

1343
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,759
Alien setup

1344
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
Facebook Sandra

1345
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
The one

1346
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,183
Alien of choice

1347
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
Which are millet

1348
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
Come out

1349
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
So I did

1350
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,167
Run at 5

1351
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Possible

1352
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,031
Very possible

1353
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
They're going to bring in the bugs

1354
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
Sears

1355
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,175
Mars Attacks

1356
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
Stop

1357
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
Nicholson

1358
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,879
Get it

1359
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
What

1360
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,743
Once you hear her be actually racist in the real world

1361
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
Then the moment she goes

1362
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:21,119
Obviously divided along racial

1363
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,143
And you're like

1364
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,167
Alright well

1365
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:28,031
A really really bad

1366
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,615
It does have that

1367
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:37,503
That's a limitation of us listening to so much of this and actually hearing

1368
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,063
Her we can't be

1369
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,343
Pretending

1370
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:47,743
Not aware of those positions

1371
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
That like

1372
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,303
Is all of this racial

1373
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,095
Specification of aliens

1374
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,887
Just sort of a way to

1375
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,191
Ask some other feeling you have

1376
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,543
It's pretty difficult as all of their races which are

1377
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,615
Completely different from each other even though they're all under the

1378
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,663
The same race

1379
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,687
Factions in real life

1380
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,735
Alright lady we get it you don't like black

1381
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,015
Just leave us alone

1382
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:13,855
That's difficult for us to parse out it's really a challenge

1383
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:21,279
Racial element

1384
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,863
Your statement

1385
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,143
What is the difficult for us

1386
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,727
Feel like have to listen to this and like really trying to figure out like

1387
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,031
You really talk about aliens what you doing

1388
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
But

1389
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,359
We would be so f******

1390
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
Selfish

1391
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,479
If we didn't recognize that this is difficult for

1392
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,783
Carrie 2

1393
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,831
She has to go

1394
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,855
To a prison

1395
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:51,743
Take notes with a little pencil

1396
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
It's

1397
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
So hard

1398
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
Everything I'm

1399
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
I'm talking about

1400
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
Is available on my way

1401
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,423
On a

1402
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
Talk here

1403
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
And

1404
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,287
Basically

1405
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
Did those notes

1406
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
Taking right after I

1407
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
I leave

1408
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
Recite as well as

1409
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:11,967
Time when I

1410
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,527
Note to myself

1411
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,063
Pencil

1412
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,183
So I'm getting a lot of

1413
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Good stuff

1414
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Out there

1415
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
Through this

1416
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,559
Process but it is very low

1417
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
You might imagine

1418
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,911
And

1419
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
It is

1420
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
Aggravated

1421
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
Weird

1422
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Appearances

1423
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
We're having now

1424
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Testing my

1425
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
There's no reason

1426
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Frames

1427
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
These little

1428
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,391
Just bear with me

1429
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
It's very important

1430
01:18:55,231 --> 01:19:00,863
Maybe because I don't know if your CPU stands going to bring up hey you said it wrong

1431
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,471
I don't know if I don't know what kind of search function you're going to use today

1432
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
I mean

1433
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,383
Is there a twelve-year-old across the

1434
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,711
The street from her that could do this for a real quick like a flower

1435
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,991
Hey that's possible

1436
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,527
Get an unpaid item

1437
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
So hard

1438
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:25,183
So another Trend that's happening throughout

1439
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,023
Going to get a Raptor

1440
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:37,215
There's another Trend that's going through this episode and that is kind of optimistic that Mark might get out

1441
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Go to prison

1442
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,823
Reasons for it are a little thin

1443
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Okay

1444
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,639
There are men who have been

1445
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,919
I'm trained to fight the

1446
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
Men who have

1447
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,735
Have been

1448
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,271
Throughout their career doing

1449
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Young World

1450
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
Where this is

1451
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
They're being sent

1452
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,463
Saturn

1453
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
Mars

1454
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
The Moon

1455
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,815
Outside our solar

1456
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,055
The bottom line is

1457
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
People like Marco

1458
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
Mark Richard

1459
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
Would be

1460
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
Extremely valuable

1461
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
In the battle

1462
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
Especially

1463
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,832
So this

1464
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Where

1465
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,160
There are some rays

1466
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,696
I believe

1467
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,512
These ideas

1468
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:35,840
Real

1469
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
Just a matter of how to be

1470
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
The humans alkire

1471
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,872
Yeah I got a break

1472
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
People like him who been trained to fight

1473
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,480
If aliens do come

1474
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:57,856
I'm right with you were storming the Bastille together we're going to need Mark in the coming battle

1475
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:03,232
Honestly if there is an alien invasion Marcus the least of my words

1476
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:10,912
I've not sure I care if he gets out of prison helpful

1477
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,472
What's a low priority

1478
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:20,640
I also think I can honestly I think he is

1479
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,456
Also in terms of

1480
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,784
My positions about like prison reform

1481
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
And stuff like that like

1482
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:34,208
I do think Mark is probably still a danger to I don't know if it's not the

1483
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,024
You could still accommodate with

1484
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,912
Like good supervision outside of prison

1485
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,984
But he's been in for 20-something years

1486
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,824
Play I don't I don't know if it's really doing him any good

1487
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:55,200
Movie based on how crazy he is and how he clearly is still trying to indoctrinate people

1488
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:01,600
Maybe I'll become more medical facility is more appropriate for him

1489
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,416
I don't have any empathy or like pity for him

1490
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,720
But also based on my voice.

1491
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
Assertive

1492
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,560
Rapid prison state that we have

1493
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:14,912
Would be inconsistent for me to be like yeah keep this old man in

1494
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:21,312
With you if if the idea behind prison is Rehabilitation and not record

1495
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,456
Then I agree there's no reason for people to be if there's no reason for people to be

1496
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
In prison

1497
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:34,624
At all we should have different whatever time I think it's appropriate

1498
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,696
Condition

1499
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,512
Same time

1500
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,560
There are people like Marc rich

1501
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,840
Do I do feel like

1502
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,632
Being allowed to speak

1503
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,424
Two other human beings they are at.

1504
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
To the rest

1505
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,008
Like there's no way

1506
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:55,104
They talked

1507
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,200
Cuz if he starts talking to people

1508
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
She's going to get weird

1509
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,320
Cordoned off for some

1510
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,112
Nothing like I don't want

1511
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:13,792
Bright do harm imagining like a conman Kanye

1512
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:24,288
Look at them all a good site will put gdubs on there I don't think that

1513
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,592
Illusion I don't know I think there's a way to

1514
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:31,456
Construct some sort of a post-release program that would be able to like

1515
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,504
Some sort of a

1516
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,784
The caseworker who

1517
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,064
Could keep an eye on like

1518
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,880
Are you f****** manipulating rest

1519
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,440
Yeah I think it's possible

1520
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,976
Steel beam

1521
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:43,744
You know

1522
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,144
You're imagining his superhuman powers

1523
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,960
Bring somebody for them has a certain superpowers that I'm unfamiliar

1524
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264
Call Bean

1525
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
Charismatic

1526
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360
Sociopath

1527
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:02,432
And there are plenty of people around

1528
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:08,576
I don't know I'm not enough specifically advocating for anything in particular

1529
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,856
Just saying

1530
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,720
I do I don't know what the right solution here is I think maybe

1531
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,024
I also like I guess to the

1532
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
Baldwin's

1533
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:26,240
If they were so if they were dead set on him staying in prison that I think I would have a dick

1534
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
Difficult

1535
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:31,360
Yeah I don't know I don't know I have a lot of

1536
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,384
Ambivalent

1537
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,432
If I if there was an answer for

1538
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,992
I'm sure people smarter than us

1539
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
Would probably have

1540
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,832
And so far I don't know if there's

1541
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:55,936
That's what they say to you

1542
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,472
We will say all right.

1543
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:03,872
Gucci swimsuit review but like the aliens

1544
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:08,480
Look Paradise

1545
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,832
I hate to admit it but I'll be a great show

1546
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,648
Cuz you can have a ton of conman trying to con each other

1547
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:22,048
There's no marks on the island

1548
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:28,448
Children's March the World Series of Poker

1549
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:33,056
Thousand dollars to start with

1550
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,592
At the end of a week win

1551
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:40,736
We're going back to Our Roots early early days on this podcast we had some great

1552
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,016
TV ideas

1553
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:46,368
This one might be out there

1554
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:52,768
And I love this sort of thing on TV shows

1555
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
That we're not the only one

1556
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Mark has been

1557
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:01,984
Teaching a screenwriting class to inmates for the past two years and they have a neck

1558
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,056
Excellent series idea he's been trying to send me some

1559
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
So we're going to try

1560
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:09,920
A few different

1561
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Tactics

1562
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
To get them out to me

1563
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,064
Obviously with my background in Hollywood

1564
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
I am very interested

1565
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,392
I'm going back in the Hollywood

1566
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,160
And getting

1567
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,464
Movies and television series made

1568
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,768
Of course from the stories that I've Been Told

1569
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:32,960
This feels more sincere than a lot of the alien s***

1570
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
I get it

1571
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
Carrie

1572
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,848
Cuz if you were real

1573
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
Said I'm teaching

1574
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,224
Screenwriting class you could like

1575
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,016
Okay that's a big red flag

1576
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,344
I'm going to say maybe your

1577
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,392
A screenwriting class

1578
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,256
Yeah but you know how it goes like all of these things are so easy with it

1579
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:59,072
The framework wants

1580
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,352
Fictional sci-fi

1581
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,496
It's actually a biopic

1582
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:10,848
Play

1583
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
Indications that disqualify

1584
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,344
TV show going

1585
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,624
You got it whatever

1586
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:26,976
So much like the California fires were just alien

1587
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,792
Other natural disasters

1588
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,584
Thighs if that's a more

1589
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,376
Hurricane Dorian

1590
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,680
It stayed for several

1591
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:40,032
Dave's over the island in the Bahamas and hurricanes just don't do that

1592
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,056
It was targeted

1593
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,616
An engineered and Mark has not revealed

1594
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,432
The real purpose behind

1595
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,480
What they did with hurricane

1596
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
Dorian

1597
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,576
But it was created and had a lot

1598
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,856
Do with I believe

1599
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,904
Removing people

1600
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,696
Because of the intense amount of

1601
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,720
Tivity

1602
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,280
Going on at the undersea bases in that

1603
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,048
Vicinity

1604
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
And

1605
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,096
So they wanted

1606
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,144
To get people off that Island

1607
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,192
And I believe that

1608
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,544
To return so that's a very important

1609
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,080
Point and again we've got

1610
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,360
Populations moving

1611
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:18,944
There a lot of people won't be able to return because they

1612
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,272
This is so disrespectful to like

1613
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,600
People who are going through disasters

1614
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,952
People out of an undersea base

1615
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:35,584
Look at this is just rewriting tragedy in order to fit into your mold

1616
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,656
It is gross

1617
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,680
I think that

1618
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,728
That's actually maybe

1619
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,752
Standable parts

1620
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:49,408
Text because it's you're scared you're scared of the fact that this happened

1621
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
It's too big

1622
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
Yes

1623
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,992
Comprehend

1624
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:58,624
Just just living in Chicago I was thinking about this on the walk over here after

1625
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,392
Just like

1626
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,464
The amount of damage

1627
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,488
That has been

1628
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,256
Done

1629
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,048
And is still going on

1630
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,864
All of these

1631
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,168
F****** failures of people who are in the governor

1632
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,520
And I was walking here and I was

1633
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
My life has not

1634
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Changed

1635
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
All

1636
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:24,224
Other than to be constantly.

1637
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
Bright

1638
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,296
Material

1639
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,600
Play my my

1640
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
Really hasn't

1641
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,416
Like physically affected

1642
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,440
You know I'm not

1643
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,024
Now all day everyday because

1644
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,792
Cuz of climate change

1645
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,560
I'm not

1646
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,608
My f****** land is in

1647
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:46,752
You're not going nowhere up there now

1648
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,800
You do want to

1649
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,848
Create another X

1650
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,872
Nation Ford

1651
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,664
Because the reality of it is

1652
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:56,224
If my life

1653
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,320
Sucking the life out of everybody

1654
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:06,720
To allow those explanations to mask what's really happening

1655
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,744
On a personal level

1656
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,792
Because sometimes it's

1657
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Too hard

1658
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
The difference

1659
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
Between

1660
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,912
Taking a personal Escapist route

1661
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
What they're doing

1662
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,728
Is very big

1663
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:22,336
Because this is advocating that as an explanation to an audience

1664
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,408
The function of that

1665
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,480
Is 2 take away the audience's impetus

1666
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,504
To do any

1667
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,272
It's

1668
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,296
2 take away like

1669
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
Okay

1670
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,952
This hurricane was really really tragic should be on the people who are going through it

1671
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:41,024
They're trying to direct resources as best as you can

1672
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,304
To the people who

1673
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,352
Can survive

1674
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:47,936
And honoring the factory

1675
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
Yes

1676
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:55,104
Everyone's talking about the hurricane but in reality

1677
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,152
Tragedy

1678
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,688
Force your narrative

1679
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
And that sucks

1680
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,016
That sucks that's far beyond

1681
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:07,904
Escapist sell therapeutic denial

1682
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
If I if I had a

1683
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:11,488
Friend

1684
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
Who was

1685
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,048
Expressing something like this

1686
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,096
I might not be as a

1687
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
You know

1688
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:19,680
I might not think they're really smart

1689
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,776
I wouldn't be as offended as someone who's disseminating it to an audience

1690
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,336
I think I see what you

1691
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,640
I thought you meant

1692
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,456
If I was friends with Carrie I might have to use a grate

1693
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:35,552
If Ellen was asked was friends with George W

1694
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,952
Just emphasize totally

1695
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,000
That ideas like

1696
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,280
I totally get

1697
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
Why you

1698
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,072
Feel the need

1699
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,352
Create the separate

1700
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,144
Because it is a

1701
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,424
Nightmare

1702
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
Sure

1703
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
Play nightmare

1704
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,008
And if you're not

1705
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,032
Personally affect

1706
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,824
Impetus

1707
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,872
Create an alternate reality that

1708
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,176
Sense of it without having to

1709
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,480
Talk to people who are a

1710
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:10,880
I totally get that but all that doesn't protect your unaffectionate problem the expense of the people who are actually work

1711
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:16,256
Directly affected

1712
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,632
It's understandable on on a human

1713
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,448
Ultimately

1714
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:31,360
Destructive and damaging to the people affected by the cover-up

1715
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,688
Look out your mouth carry

1716
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,456
Sure

1717
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,272
As We Know

1718
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,808
The un's in the mick

1719
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:43,392
Always talked about this a little bit

1720
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,952
They're the cover-up alien stuff

1721
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
Who cares

1722
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:52,608
I have to say that in the past Mark has talked about

1723
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
The UN and the

1724
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,656
Meetings and

1725
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Peru

1726
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,704
And also in

1727
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,472
In Exeter

1728
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,240
Example of

1729
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,568
Where we have alien meeting with human

1730
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,104
In a very steep

1731
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,128
Location

1732
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,408
This does happen

1733
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,480
Candy Rush

1734
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
Talked about this

1735
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,784
So these meetings

1736
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,552
Arnot

1737
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,832
That unusual

1738
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Obviously

1739
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,136
The UN is involved

1740
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,928
Peru

1741
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:21,792
Paul Joseph Watson oh my God

1742
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:22,816
What

1743
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:27,424
I don't know I don't care if the only thing I heard from that Cliff was Danbury

1744
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,496
Meetings

1745
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,032
I've never heard that name before

1746
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,568
Most people have it

1747
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,872
Because he got discredited real fast

1748
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,176
Versus a guy who was involved

1749
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
Conspiracy World drama

1750
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,784
He claims to be a scientist working for

1751
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,552
Pick 12

1752
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:47,136
In the secret government that's a big group in a program

1753
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,672
He's working on Project

1754
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,208
Involving aliens in ship

1755
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,256
He told some amazing stories

1756
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:56,352
About life lived in top-secret work and you made a big splash around 2,000

1757
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,144
The Paranormal

1758
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
Conspiracy world is really bad

1759
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,960
Generally

1760
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:07,872
Most of the participants are hopelessly gullible or they're trying to run Conn's themselves so whenever someone comes forward with information that states

1761
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Send to their worldview

1762
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,920
There was never tape

1763
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,944
Take a step back

1764
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,480
Question the new information

1765
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,760
They typically just

1766
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:18,368
Excitedly Corporation new information into their narrative

1767
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:23,744
Accusing anyone who speaks being on the ferry of conspiracy against truth

1768
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:27,328
This is not the case of Dan burisch when he came forward

1769
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:33,984
Some of the space people found his story a little bit weird and decided to look into it a little bit particularly Coast

1770
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,032
Coast frequent guest Linda Moulton Howe

1771
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,824
I'm not saying any of this stuff

1772
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,384
But she puts out generally

1773
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,664
Aboveboard

1774
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,224
But she did look into official records

1775
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,504
Involving Danbury

1776
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:48,320
Apply for Chapter 7 bankruptcy

1777
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:51,648
Right around the time he started to come forward with his alien allegation

1778
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:58,048
From there she Tracked Down record surrounding his education has debts that the bankruptcy Were Meant to clear

1779
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,840
Employment history

1780
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:07,264
This is completely worthless and honestly the story isn't as interesting as it may seem like it could be

1781
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:13,664
But the bottom line is that all this available information

1782
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,968
Alien research projects

1783
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,504
He's just making it all up

1784
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,904
Ultimately doesn't matter though it's already on even on this episode the logic of people

1785
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,208
Program s*** it's airtight

1786
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,256
You produce evidence that this guy was working

1787
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:33,376
Completely different job when he claimed to be working with alien you can just cover job

1788
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,936
That's of course it says he works there

1789
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:43,360
There's no record of him getting a Ph.D that he claims to have

1790
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,896
And you can just

1791
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:47,456
Space program is keeping his diploma Under Wraps

1792
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:54,368
If you know you're off Mission at a time when you may have committed murder

1793
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,440
10 acceptable explanation for this

1794
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,232
It's the same thing

1795
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,536
Dan burisch is someone who

1796
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,352
The only the farthest out there

1797
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,632
Conspiracy folks

1798
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,912
Still consider

1799
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,704
Anyway worth ref

1800
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,104
Project Blue beam is something that has been discredited by more critical thinking

1801
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:26,880
Right around the corner

1802
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:30,208
Those elements of this space weirdo community

1803
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,256
They probably would have much

1804
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,792
Higher standards

1805
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:39,168
They're still not working off concrete proof they still have a more critical stance on it

1806
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,448
There are different

1807
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,800
Certain sections of the UFO ology

1808
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,568
Folks

1809
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,848
And the boar

1810
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:51,712
Do you have Project Blue beam

1811
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,736
Listed as

1812
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,760
Credible things

1813
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:54,784
On this episode

1814
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,064
And that's two strikes

1815
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,088
In terms of

1816
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,368
Things that even

1817
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,952
A lot of the UFO Community thinking

1818
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,768
That's not good

1819
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,536
Fun

1820
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
His meeting with aliens

1821
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,840
Exeter

1822
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,912
That's not good I would say

1823
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,216
I will give you a third strike though

1824
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:20,128
Thinking that a murderer was our planet

1825
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,920
I think that one strike number three

1826
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:25,504
I think the employee for short

1827
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:29,088
And all the rest of her career

1828
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,720
Mark tells Carrie something

1829
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,024
That is absolutely not true

1830
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,584
Try to find evidence

1831
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,352
That what this

1832
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
And she cannot

1833
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,728
So then she asked for the audience's help

1834
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,520
Mark talked about a television

1835
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:52,640
In which it has a red-headed version of me

1836
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,200
Who investigate stories

1837
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,992
He said it's worth watching

1838
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,784
They're disclosing.

1839
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,368
Can I haven't found that

1840
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,720
But if you find it or know what show it is please let me

1841
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
And I will

1842
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,560
Search for it obvious

1843
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:16,448
What's up there's a show on the CW carry Butt-head

1844
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,288
I know I care

1845
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:24,384
I don't know what it is

1846
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:30,016
TW say something so specific

1847
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:37,440
Possibilities for the programming

1848
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:41,024
Who's alive who's dead

1849
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,072
The first possibility is the Legacy

1850
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,144
Okay goodnight show

1851
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:52,544
Kind of red-haired werewolves and vampires

1852
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,336
It also seems unlikely

1853
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:57,408
But it's on the red hair

1854
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,456
Maybe

1855
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:05,344
The other possibility is that Marcus commercial for the upcoming W version of Nancy Drew

1856
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,416
Which definitely features are redheads

1857
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:13,280
If they feed you enough for everything it's all the Mysteries

1858
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,840
I don't think of it all

1859
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:19,680
Through the goddamn cellular carrier

1860
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,704
It's just

1861
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,240
The CW has sex

1862
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:25,312
A specific in-house style that you're like

1863
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,848
Course Mark Richards love

1864
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,616
The CW

1865
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:33,760
I honestly think that has to do with them not getting more cable

1866
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:36,320
You get enough cable

1867
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,088
The CW

1868
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
If you don't

1869
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:44,512
If you're in prison you may not get a lot of choice it might be a democratic thing

1870
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,072
Love you and you have to watch

1871
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,864
Stereotypical

1872
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,656
It is not a democratic thing in prison

1873
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,424
But

1874
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,192
You may be correct

1875
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:58,336
Anyway I don't I don't I don't pretend to understand how marks entertainment

1876
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,432
Choices are drawn to him by side

1877
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
The flash when the flash put

1878
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,576
True does he solve alien Mysteries

1879
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,648
Okay

1880
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,768
Figure it out neither can we

1881
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:22,144
So we get back to this trend of like geopolitical issues just showing alien

1882
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
Babies really

1883
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:29,056
It's always past the point of acceptability

1884
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,592
But this one's pretty bad

1885
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,384
Mark does talk about

1886
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
The reptoids

1887
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,176
Africa

1888
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,224
And he did talk about how

1889
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,272
The race from aldebaran

1890
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,296
Would be expand

1891
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,320
A lot like

1892
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
What happened

1893
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,112
Durian

1894
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,648
Bushwacker

1895
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
In America

1896
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
During

1897
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,232
1800

1898
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:52,352
Settlers and the settlement started

1899
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,656
And get larger and larger

1900
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,680
Sounds like

1901
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:57,984
Africa

1902
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,312
There are

1903
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,128
Let's see settlements that are

1904
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,712
Spread out

1905
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:11,808
Further also on the way to the main base and

1906
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,088
They start out with

1907
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:13,856
Acquiring

1908
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
One or two

1909
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:15,904
Item

1910
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,952
Skechers chocolate

1911
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,488
Certain minerals

1912
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
But apparently there

1913
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,536
Expanding

1914
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,328
And this has become

1915
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,352
Problem

1916
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,520
This is what I mean

1917
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,312
And to look for those indica

1918
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
Tell you you're getting

1919
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,944
Clubs in some truth

1920
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:39,968
Which would be

1921
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
That there is

1922
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,016
Skirmishes

1923
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
Way

1924
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
And methods

1925
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,000
So when you see in the developing world

1926
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:58,400
Modern-day consequences of colonial system

1927
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:01,472
Sorry about those things it's just aliens looking for chocolate

1928
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,664
This kind of thing going

1929
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,456
Sudden shortage of chalk

1930
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,320
Naturalist

1931
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,112
Probably cuz she thinks it would sound

1932
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,160
To say here's how you know

1933
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,464
Not enough

1934
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,256
This is just

1935
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,560
Whitewashing

1936
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,584
It is

1937
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,608
Trying to take

1938
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,680
Real world situations that you should be

1939
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
Concerned about

1940
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:37,824
Create

1941
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:44,224
Is agitate for alien disclosure

1942
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:48,064
Hey Simon parkes and Randy Kramer and Jerry

1943
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,904
Stupid it's misdirection probably

1944
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,952
Well-meaning

1945
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,536
Here's the thing that nobody wants

1946
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,632
European colonialism

1947
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,704
Talk to the world and we're still dealing with the

1948
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,240
500 years later

1949
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,776
And it's probably going to kill us all

1950
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:08,800
So

1951
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,152
How about me

1952
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,944
Alien

1953
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,480
Sprouts

1954
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,576
New episode it turns into like

1955
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:23,392
A situation where mark is really mad at the hater

1956
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:28,000
Is Yorkies super pissed off at the people who were talking s*** about him

1957
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,304
And I really hoped it was awesome

1958
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,584
Does he have online access

1959
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:36,192
I think you must to some extent

1960
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:36,960
Limited

1961
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,496
Heavily

1962
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:42,080
I don't know I don't know how much that is

1963
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:47,968
Like of his own accord how much like his wife is telling him that he's telling him

1964
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,016
It's possible that he's getting everything

1965
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,064
Secondhand

1966
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,880
I really hope he was talking about us

1967
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,672
But I don't think he is

1968
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,952
It's really sad

1969
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,720
I wish

1970
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,304
Now regarding the attacks

1971
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,096
Mark Richards

1972
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,632
In the alternative media

1973
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,960
The attacks are aimed at marks effort

1974
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,008
Commuted sentence

1975
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,056
And

1976
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
Could affect the ruling

1977
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,616
The weather

1978
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
Parole

1979
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,992
Let's see he

1980
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,552
She is Ben

1981
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,320
Quite

1982
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,088
Concerned

1983
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,112
About the attacks

1984
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
On him

1985
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,416
And his wife Joanne

1986
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:29,440
Say as well

1987
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,744
And the rest of his

1988
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,512
His family

1989
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,048
That is

1990
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:34,816
Something

1991
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,120
His lawyers to deal with

1992
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,960
Regarding

1993
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,752
Is that tax ID

1994
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,520
Communicate

1995
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
But I think that they

1996
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:45,824
Provide a

1997
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,592
Platform

1998
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,896
That serves the dark and the

1999
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,176
People who want to

2000
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,200
To remain in the dark

2001
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,480
And

2002
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,784
Cannot harm

2003
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,576
There is death

2004
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,344
Currently

2005
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,648
Mafia

2006
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,928
Gay Mafia

2007
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,976
Pedophile

2008
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,512
She's right there

2009
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
With the group

2010
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,888
Also have some

2011
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,656
Background

2012
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
Sharia

2013
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,448
What area

2014
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,216
And I am also

2015
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,544
British Intel

2016
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:22,944
That's what I realize this isn't about us are you saying that the gay Mafia is being

2017
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,224
Run by British

2018
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:28,064
This is about Kevin but obviously

2019
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,160
She's already made these sorts of allegation

2020
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:36,000
Pedophile Mafia

2021
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:43,168
I wish it was I know it was about us

2022
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:49,568
Somewhat viral viral

2023
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,336
Contacted her

2024
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
Has viewer that's true

2025
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:01,600
Which is strange because his his

2026
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,160
F****** channeling episodes where he says

2027
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,440
He doesn't need to do voices

2028
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,232
Absolutely riveting

2029
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
I just

2030
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,864
I'm just worried

2031
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,936
Or being overlooked

2032
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,472
We've got a lot of

2033
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:23,872
Very public beach that nobody wants

2034
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:29,504
It's like they're about it

2035
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,808
I mean hate luck weave

2036
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:38,464
Very couple of beers. I like we usually don't drink during

2037
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:44,864
Is Mark Richards

2038
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:51,264
We're hypercritical of his bones also not call

2039
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,664
Calling for his parole not go through or whatever

2040
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,272
Penalty

2041
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:05,344
Good luck trying to link me with

2042
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:14,560
That was mean

2043
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:21,728
And like obviously

2044
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:22,496
It's not us

2045
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,568
It becomes even more clear that it's not us and

2046
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:29,152
Mark has contacts in

2047
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,176
Intelligence

2048
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,224
That they are involved

2049
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:33,760
This

2050
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:34,528
Still

2051
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,320
Possible

2052
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,368
In my view

2053
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:40,928
Gree

2054
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,720
Mark and his team of lawyers

2055
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,744
Found a substantial

2056
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:46,304
Dirt on this hacker

2057
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,632
And this will be released in a video in the future

2058
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,168
Hardee's

2059
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,960
I will not be involved

2060
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,800
Packers

2061
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,592
If their attacks

2062
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,152
Continue that

2063
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,456
This information

2064
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,736
In about them will come out

2065
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:16,256
Obviously

2066
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:19,328
Pitstop

2067
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:25,728
Bring it yeah so when I heard that Mark was mad at people in alternative media

2068
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,008
I really hope that he was talking

2069
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:31,104
I have to assume that we would come up in a Google search for Mark Richard

2070
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,176
But it's hard to know how far down the results

2071
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:36,224
Most of the top results are about a surfer

2072
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:42,624
Who's also

2073
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:48,000
Yeah I feel good

2074
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:52,096
I had a few different thoughts about a possible Feud developing with Mark Richards

2075
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:54,144
The first was that it sounded like a lot of fun

2076
01:48:54,400 --> 01:49:00,544
I could just imagine us getting casted acolytes of like the spider leadership or some s*** and honestly I

2077
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:06,944
We belong somewhere the mythology

2078
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:14,368
Pictures from my past we could dig up and repurpose

2079
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,464
And honestly I do feel snubbed it we're not in the mythology

2080
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:19,488
But is this point

2081
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:22,048
Personally I think I should be a few

2082
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,168
But Beggars can't be choosers

2083
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:31,264
I feel like I feel like I want to be

2084
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:37,664
Mercantile dog

2085
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:45,600
My other thought though and I think this is a bigger thought that I had is that it's probably good that he's not choosing us as enemies

2086
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:52,256
This guy's a murderer gets out of prison and the last

2087
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:58,656
Creative angry guy stuck in prison of Stephen about me

2088
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:01,728
I don't like your use of the word

2089
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,032
I will give you creative

2090
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,824
I will not give you really

2091
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:10,688
Until you do better than I had a Starship Enterprise like vessel

2092
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,480
You don't get a really creative

2093
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,040
I think he's able to incorporate all of these

2094
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,088
These disparate pieces of Syfy

2095
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,624
Into something

2096
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:26,816
Agree with your assessment that it's not good but it's created

2097
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,400
A

2098
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
Creator creator

2099
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704
Very

2100
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,288
Exactly OK Market

2101
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,592
Any gave Terry a four-page letter

2102
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:42,688
And it was addressed to who Mark is calling quotes

2103
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,016
Himself is Jesus

2104
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:50,112
Which is a murderer to do

2105
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:53,440
The first thing I can tell from this letter is it was definitely written

2106
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:59,840
The voice is completely different and honestly it's pretty well written

2107
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,120
From a rhetorical question

2108
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:07,008
There's good good balance between short and long sentences good use of metaphor

2109
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,312
There's some inaccuracies like him saying

2110
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:11,872
Judas sold Jesus out for 30 pieces of gold

2111
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,664
Instead of silver but I'm not

2112
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,968
In the letter mark

2113
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,016
Calls out his enemies by name

2114
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:22,880
Attention

2115
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:30,304
Because I'm all caught up on the drama I know that this has to be about Kevin Moore the guy who's creating a documentary about Mark

2116
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,072
Carrie

2117
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:33,376
Doesn't explain the personal

2118
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,168
Why would Mark call Kevin

2119
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:39,264
Not like this British documentarian is a former friend of his

2120
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:44,640
That's explained by the fact that for his documentary Kevin his interview people like Marx

2121
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
Text wife

2122
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,944
His former best friend

2123
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,040
And the guy who are convinced to commit the actual murder Crossing Hoover

2124
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:55,904
I'm guessing that this letter is specifically about Hoover talking to Kevin

2125
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:00,512
Scientist most damning piece of information that could be in a documentary

2126
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:03,584
It's tough to get around the guy who did the murder say

2127
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,632
Mark was there he told me to stab the guy with

2128
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,424
Screwdriver welding watch

2129
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:12,032
You can understand the impulse to try and intimidate that guy or preemptively

2130
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:16,384
Discredit him is working for evil aliens or some s***

2131
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:22,272
The letter itself Beyond it's surprisingly decent writing is a Showcase of Mark's manipulative ability

2132
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:28,416
He portrays himself as a heroic bringer of Truth in the victim of out-of-control Internet negativity

2133
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:30,208
Holding close to his main thesis

2134
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,232
Quote

2135
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:36,864
If all I'm doing is trying to bring out the truth why would anyone attack me unless they're working for

2136
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,144
Getting the truth the Press

2137
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:38,912
Sure

2138
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:41,472
That's a totally reasonable argument

2139
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:43,008
Sure

2140
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,824
There's one line that I thought was particularly funny

2141
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:51,712
It also gets to me how such negative lunatics get more and more carried away with our personal attack

2142
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:56,832
Rather than staying on track with either science or any sort of rational argument about the facts

2143
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,904
You want to stay on track with the facts inside

2144
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:04,256
Do that proved to be the Rapture aliens want to kill making chocolate

2145
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:08,096
The person making The Sensational claim is the one with the burden of proof

2146
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:11,936
It's not like I could say in addition to the murder he was involved

2147
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:18,336
Mark Richards also set off a nuke in Manitoba

2148
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:26,528
Rightly would I reply to this is absurd night no evidence of my claim

2149
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:28,320
That Manitoba has ever been do

2150
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:33,184
If you really f***** up and stupid for me to pretend that I was being attacked by him responding

2151
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,488
You have no evidence for the claims are made

2152
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,256
Yeah

2153
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,816
That's one level of this

2154
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,864
It is another great line

2155
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:48,544
It comes in this letter after a passage about how Judas hung himself after he realized that what he did was wrong

2156
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:54,944
Now that might read that is him calling for his enemies to kill themselves but I'm going to leave that alone for the

2157
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:57,248
Mark says of these people quote

2158
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:59,296
I've nothing but titty for such people

2159
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:01,856
As the weight of such a weakness and guilt has to be crushed

2160
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:06,464
No wonder all of them are such failures that everything creative they've ever tried to do a life

2161
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,000
God dammit that's rude

2162
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:12,352
Coming from Mako Shark ramp

2163
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:14,144
Here's the first thing that

2164
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,984
Based on your assessment of the writing

2165
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,008
In this letter

2166
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,080
I assumed it was written

2167
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,360
What mid

2168
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:24,384
Early to

2169
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,456
Early 2000s

2170
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Was written

2171
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:28,992
Last week

2172
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,552
So and when was the

2173
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,088
The shity book written

2174
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,368
Long ago

2175
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:36,928
That's a testament if we have any aspiring

2176
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,000
Even if

2177
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,536
You're terrible right now

2178
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:47,424
Lock yourself up in prison for murdering a guy and then really focus on your writing

2179
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,216
20 years later you will get

2180
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,496
A good for paste

2181
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:53,312
Take your argument make it a little better

2182
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,384
I would say that if you want to get better at something

2183
01:54:57,152 --> 01:55:00,736
The prison education system can make you better at something

2184
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:07,392
Why not Avail yourself of the available resources

2185
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:11,488
Lifelong learning is available

2186
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:13,024
As it is

2187
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
Is a

2188
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,328
NeverEnding Story

2189
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,376
Murderous rage

2190
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
That the people who

2191
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:21,216
Perpetrate these awful crime

2192
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,544
Will preemptively call other people the purple

2193
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,312
Portrayed

2194
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:27,104
Of course

2195
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,992
Universal to everyone everywhere

2196
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:38,112
Exactly what number of times people Liars in that letter is

2197
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,928
Rosier pastures

2198
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,488
Find out

2199
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:47,584
So there's these fires in California they're covering up an alien invasion through portals

2200
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:51,936
Logan find out

2201
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:54,752
Batman this guy knows how to deliver the goods

2202
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
They are

2203
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,824
Populated areas

2204
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:58,848
Making speaker

2205
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,200
The distance

2206
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,296
Fornia

2207
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,856
I did ask him again

2208
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
And what

2209
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,392
Kind of

2210
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:13,440
Invading

2211
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,464
Through that port

2212
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,256
In Paradise

2213
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,304
And he said they were

2214
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,352
Spider

2215
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:21,632
Octopus

2216
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,936
They are Hunters

2217
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,984
Planet

2218
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,520
That is about to

2219
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:28,544
Versailles

2220
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,080
And their Moon

2221
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:33,664
Jordan you're laughing

2222
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:38,016
But what else would a spider breed with been an octopus

2223
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,808
Makes sense

2224
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:45,184
Makes sense for the spider would breed with an octopus

2225
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,464
Eight legs

2226
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:50,304
Makes perfect sandwich house scary giant spider that can spit ink would be

2227
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,072
Crazy

2228
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:52,096
Biggest squid

2229
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:58,496
Has no bones

2230
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:02,848
Octopus alien

2231
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:10,528
Here's my favorite doesn't matter any animal is now an alien eyes

2232
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,576
Mark understands

2233
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,344
Holy

2234
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:16,160
The conundrum of the Marvel movie

2235
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:18,208
Which is you gotta always racist

2236
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,256
Every movie has to raise mistake

2237
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:26,656
Octopus

2238
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:35,872
Screenwriting class

2239
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:42,016
You breathed the four-legged alien you end up with six legs

2240
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,040
Duck

2241
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,064
So stock

2242
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:44,832
Between

2243
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:45,856
Finger Lakes

2244
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:48,672
That is the dumbest s*** I've ever heard

2245
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,440
And also

2246
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,464
That is f******

2247
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,792
Brilliant

2248
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,328
Such sense

2249
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:59,168
Great

2250
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:04,032
So the California are alien related

2251
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:05,824
Regarding the fires in

2252
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,592
Amazon

2253
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,152
That is erupting

2254
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:09,920
Version

2255
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:11,200
He said

2256
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,224
Those are

2257
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:14,272
Creating the

2258
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,040
Sapphires

2259
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:19,648
They have to be very very careful

2260
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,672
Not

2261
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,440
To have

2262
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,208
Dumb rich

2263
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:23,232
Entrepreneur

2264
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,792
Or liberal go down

2265
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:28,864
Catch sight of the reptilian

2266
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,888
Shep's creating

2267
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,912
The fires

2268
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,472
So this is a problem

2269
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,032
There's a lot of collateral damage

2270
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:36,800
In the area

2271
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:37,824
The Amazon

2272
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,152
Why is it a problem for liberals

2273
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:43,712
Weirdos always have

2274
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,480
How to be fascist

2275
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:51,648
You know I don't know if they all are but a lot of these voices like voices

2276
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:53,440
Are just covering up

2277
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:56,512
Symptoms of fashion

2278
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:59,328
We can't have a liberal getting in there and causing issues

2279
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,120
Spore bolsonaro

2280
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,912
Amazon conservation effort

2281
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:03,936
Yeah

2282
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:04,704
I mean

2283
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,752
See this over and over again

2284
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:09,568
Africa

2285
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:13,664
And now fires in the Amazon that are very clearly cause

2286
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:15,712
By bolsonaro

2287
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:17,248
Shipping of policy

2288
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:22,112
Like is just like rewriting real f*****-up

2289
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:24,416
Geopolitical issues

2290
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,720
Into an alien framework

2291
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,560
It's tough to not be real

2292
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,608
Offended by that

2293
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:38,752
Where is unlike these stupid pattern is consistent

2294
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,544
Like the pattern of

2295
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,592
Go to sleep

2296
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:43,872
Is almost 2

2297
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:48,480
You know some sort of

2298
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:54,880
Limited Hangout

2299
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:57,184
It's not a grand conspiracy

2300
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:59,744
Conspiracy is that

2301
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,048
This person doesn't want to deal with reality

2302
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,072
And there

2303
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:08,960
Weaving at elaborate yarn using a murder in prison in order to reinforce it

2304
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:12,032
I guess the only thing that I could

2305
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:13,056
Holiday

2306
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,336
Prosody laundry

2307
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,616
Yeah

2308
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:21,504
Or or potential atrocity laundry

2309
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,272
Car wash

2310
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,832
As a cash-only business

2311
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:27,136
You're hiring up murderer

2312
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,672
As a lies

2313
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,072
Combined

2314
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,096
Effort

2315
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,144
Their interest of the audience

2316
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,192
She's misleading down these

2317
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,240
Could

2318
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:43,776
Have some effect

2319
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:48,128
Like whatever it would be maybe

2320
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:50,944
The people helping organizing

2321
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,224
And work towards like

2322
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:56,576
Like really solving some of the issues that are behind the things therefore

2323
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,648
The derby

2324
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,440
Distracted down this road

2325
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
But

2326
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:07,584
So let's listen to something silly

2327
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:11,424
This is something that our military was doing

2328
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,984
In places like Nevada where they're said

2329
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,336
Nuclear tests going on there's actually weren't really

2330
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,128
Kenny we're fighting

2331
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,408
Then

2332
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:24,224
And the Raptors think that we

2333
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,760
Crazy to be doing this

2334
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,808
Humans did not realize

2335
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
That

2336
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:33,184
That there are aliens that like having Woodmark call Zay

2337
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:33,952
A frat party

2338
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,024
Where they are deciding it would be fun to go off

2339
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:40,608
And invade Earth and Kill Some Humans

2340
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:42,912
I'm so this is the kind of thing we're dealing with

2341
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,472
I know it's serious

2342
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:52,640
Just the Celtic people

2343
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,944
Gyros

2344
02:01:55,200 --> 02:02:01,344
But Coker.

2345
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:08,512
Whatever you say next we are going to do to f***** up to drive the spaceship

2346
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:22,848
Hit the Taco Bell on the way to Earth

2347
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:30,272
Aliens are joyriding around us

2348
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:33,088
If there were aliens

2349
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:35,136
Some of them would Joyride

2350
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:41,536
No it's not a personification of aliens

2351
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:54,336
Brains that we are just making all these aliens like a bunch of different forms

2352
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:57,920
Yeah it is it is what what's the

2353
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,456
I can't remember the theory on

2354
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,960
One Last Hurrah I know

2355
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:26,336
What you wanted

2356
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:32,224
Are frat party alien voices are very Chicago

2357
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,904
Just get dropped

2358
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,696
Chicago

2359
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:50,400
Party Town on Cermak

2360
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:04,480
I hear stuff like that in my kind of love it like that

2361
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:10,880
What I wished I wish there wasn't the elements

2362
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:13,184
This is to related

2363
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,464
Actual

2364
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:17,280
Important actual real-world events

2365
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,888
Yeah yeah yeah

2366
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,216
I probably look past

2367
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:29,824
If there were other things

2368
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,360
Just be an isolated

2369
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:36,736
Absent all of the other rewriting of

2370
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:37,504
Important

2371
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:40,832
Within the context

2372
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:44,928
The totality of his

2373
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:45,952
Yeah

2374
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,744
So we have like

2375
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,512
Now

2376
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,560
These aliens are frat party

2377
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,632
Who are like

2378
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,472
Nai

2379
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,264
Also are very humid

2380
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:00,544
It turns out

2381
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,872
I don't know what this story

2382
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,640
Carrie is about to

2383
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,432
Spell actually

2384
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:14,368
Like I assume somewhere

2385
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,208
I guess that that's probably with a space space

2386
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:21,024
I didn't look into this at all because I realized like

2387
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:22,560
There's no way

2388
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,328
There's

2389
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,096
Who cares

2390
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:26,656
The story is

2391
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,240
Themselves

2392
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:32,544
There was a story about 1 drone

2393
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:33,568
It would not

2394
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:35,104
A bay a direct order

2395
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,128
Decided

2396
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:37,664
It was

2397
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,432
The problem

2398
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,712
And

2399
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:41,504
Even when assured by the humans

2400
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:42,784
It was not a problem

2401
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:44,064
It would not believe that

2402
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:45,856
It

2403
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,392
Was ordered to read

2404
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,672
Illustration

2405
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:51,488
From outer space

2406
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:54,304
Refused

2407
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,072
And

2408
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,096
Ended up

2409
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:58,912
Getting

2410
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,960
And the Drone

2411
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,008
Selfie

2412
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:04,800
Destroying itself

2413
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,336
Refuse to

2414
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,360
Obey the order

2415
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:08,896
This isn't the military

2416
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:11,968
This is

2417
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,736
Kind of things

2418
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:13,504
Dealing

2419
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,064
Level

2420
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:16,832
Involving

2421
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:17,856
AI

2422
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:21,952
This is a soft pitch for the next Pixar movie

2423
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:25,024
These self undershirt drone

2424
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:29,632
The Drone that doubted place in the world

2425
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:31,936
This is the first time a Isley

2426
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:34,240
You know what we really understand the Nuremberg

2427
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:40,128
I won't do it I will not get your spaceship bulshit

2428
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:46,528
As soon as she said it was refilling a spaceship that's when I realized I can't

2429
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:53,184
I could probably find an article about a drunk rat

2430
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:58,304
What value would that be for us to discuss

2431
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:04,960
But it's so great cuz I also feel like there's a Wally aspects of this maybe I kind of feel like

2432
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:10,592
I really wish I honestly I was like

2433
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:12,896
I hope that I have the f***

2434
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:16,480
Coronavirus drug

2435
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:24,672
So that's the only way

2436
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:25,696
To win

2437
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,720
Is not to play

2438
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:27,488
Again

2439
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,512
That's fun

2440
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:31,840
This personified Wiley X drone

2441
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,888
Won't refuel spaceships

2442
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:34,912
Is fun

2443
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:36,960
Frat party aliens

2444
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:37,984
Hilarious

2445
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:40,800
It's always mixed up with

2446
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:43,104
S*** like that is not fun

2447
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:46,432
Is very clearly trying to rewrite real world

2448
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:47,200
Scenarios

2449
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,480
In

2450
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:49,248
Kind of races

2451
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,088
I ran by him the idea that

2452
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:54,112
The program has

2453
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:00,768
She's talking about the alien human hybrid program

2454
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:03,840
Otherwise known as Central and South America

2455
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:04,864
That it

2456
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,144
Is one of the reasons

2457
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:06,912
For the

2458
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:07,936
Increase

2459
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:08,704
Control

2460
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:09,728
Because

2461
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:11,008
The Trump Administration

2462
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,032
Concerned about

2463
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,056
X-Men

2464
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,080
Factor

2465
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:14,848
Having to

2466
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:15,872
To do with special

2467
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:16,640
Powers that

2468
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:17,664
Children

2469
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:19,200
Who are now growing up

2470
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,480
May have

2471
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,248
And

2472
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,784
She agreed

2473
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,856
He also said the TSA scanners have nothing to

2474
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
Metal

2475
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:31,232
But they are all about detecting weather urai

2476
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:34,048
Augmented human

2477
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,096
Human or alien

2478
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,376
And so on

2479
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:44,032
Increase border cruelty and Albright

2480
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:50,688
Really it's just because Trump is worried about Wolverine coming across border

2481
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:58,368
United States

2482
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,648
Kind of a whiny little assholes

2483
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:06,048
11

2484
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:11,168
What can I do

2485
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,704
Gene board

2486
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:19,104
Jim really f*** that up

2487
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:22,176
America because the alien

2488
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:25,760
Program is so strong in Central and South America

2489
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,552
Holyshit

2490
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:31,648
That's the real world

2491
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,928
Don't worry about it

2492
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:39,328
You see parents being separated from their their their children

2493
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:45,728
Logan being separated from coming out of Cruelty

2494
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:49,312
Memes

2495
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:51,616
Consider the alternative

2496
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:55,456
Nightcrawler is going to be

2497
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:58,272
Jordan career stats

2498
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:02,112
Magneto's

2499
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:03,136
Nuts

2500
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:12,352
This is B that's the primary function of a lot of gay stuff

2501
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:13,376
Really

2502
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:19,264
That concerned with that really think they are but still

2503
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,032
How

2504
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:21,056
Her listeners

2505
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:27,456
Interact with the real world they won't care about people like ACLU or immigrant-rights groups

2506
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,736
Talkin about

2507
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:32,320
The issues that are going on because it's just f******

2508
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,344
Trying to keep Psych

2509
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,112
Bob Sapp

2510
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:35,392
This is not good

2511
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,952
Feel like

2512
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,512
Exploiting is

2513
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,840
The inherent distance

2514
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:44,608
Allegory

2515
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:47,680
I've liked the fact that because

2516
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,728
I am I am

2517
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:50,752

Mexican immigrants

2519
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:56,128
If I say

2520
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:57,408
And you are a person

2521
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:58,688
Empathy

2522
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,456
You're going to say

2523
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:00,224
Ibanez

2524
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:03,296
Using an allegory for

2525
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,184
Coming across the border

2526
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:10,208
Are evil

2527
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:12,512
And then

2528
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,280
Exact

2529
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:17,888
I don't want to be mad

2530
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:24,288
Human beings are all in this together

02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:30,688
Programs in Central and South America

2532
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:33,760
Anybody

Trying to have no f****** idea

02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:40,672
They could have super Pacs

2535
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,976
You don't want to let her I would rather

2536
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:49,376
100 migrants are detained at the border than one X-Men get through

2537
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:56,032
Over

2538
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,080
Hi

2539
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:03,456
In order to reinforce this as a recommendation of a source you should look into

2540
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:06,272
Regarding the X-Men special powers

2541
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:08,832
Alien human hybrid program

2542
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:10,112
I want to recommend

2543
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:11,392
Find a movie with

2544
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:12,416
The X-Men

2545
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,696
Movie called

2546
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:14,464

Call Earl

2549
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:24,448
Scholarly scholarly reference

2550
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,984
Jean-Luc Picard

2551
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:29,568
Scholarly reference

2552
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:33,152
Made by Carrie to a source that any

2553
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:37,504
Legitimate researcher would be like well she's got us

Yep that's if you watch that movie

2555
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:42,368
Look she's right

2556
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:46,720
If she had chosen like I don't know X-Men

2557
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:48,512
The last

2558
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:52,096
That's what no one likes right

2559
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,936
Which is like

2560
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,704
Superhero

2561
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,752
So you got to know she's awesome

2562
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:01,312
After taste

2563
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,920
I would love this if it wasn't so over

2564
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:10,016
Clearly damaging to Oliver

2565
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,296
It would be

2566
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:12,064
Sophon

2567
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:16,416
Navigate to Trump

2568
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:18,208
Turns out that Marcus kind of

2569
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:26,656
Oh Knock You Out

2570
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:33,568
Mark is also much like Jay-Z night that we talked about earlier

2571
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:35,872
Might be a little qanon

2572
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:36,640
Yeah

2573
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,920
Regarding Trump

2574
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:40,480
He says Trump is always trying to

2575
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:42,016
Tweet out

2576
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,040

2578
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:46,880
He's not owned by any group

2579
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:48,416
He's highly unpredictable

2580
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:53,792
Mark admires Howie's maintains himself under the attack

2581
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:54,816
And doesn't let

2582
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,352
I'm around

2583
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:58,144

02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,168
Reincarnation

2588
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:08,896
Hallmarks of the online Cube class now

2589

Anytime there's like Miss spellings and stuff people try to figure out like what is this really say

2590
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,880
I'm not pronouncing it on Prince

2591
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:20,672
I will only do it in that voice

2592
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:28,864
I am like my Richards later

02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:04,608
Physically close to me

2625
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:11,008
I got a sexually close to each other because they are closed

2626
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:13,824
Relative three brothers and others

2627
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:15,360
As well as

2628
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:16,384
Yeah

2629
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:19,968
Scale

2630
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:22,272
Something closer to it like two stars

2631
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:28,160
Equidistant from each other that are closer to the Earth will appear closer to each other than Stars

2632
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:32,256
That are further from us that are the same distance from each other

2633
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:34,304
That is

2634
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:40,704
I don't know how a rhino say

2635
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,496
Because they're bright

2636
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:46,080
Retraction

2637
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:49,664
Okay there's a war going on there

2638
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:54,016
Are trying to distract us from that war

2639
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:58,112
Carrie reveals a specific piece of information here

2640
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,648
But I just think is fun

2641
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,416
Unstoppable

2642
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:02,720
He said there's a major war going on

2643
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:03,744
For the past year

2644
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,280
In the Orion sector

2645
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:08,352
The Drake are heavily involved in this war

2646
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,120
And

2647
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:09,888
Why

2648
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:11,680
Attempting

2649
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:12,704
There was an attempt

2650
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:14,240
Distract humans

2651
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:15,264
Raptors

2652
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:16,544
From

2653
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:17,824
This War 5

2654
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:18,592
Creating issue

2655
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:19,616
On Earth

2656
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:20,896
They're already

2657
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:23,200
Around 50,000 human serving in there

2658
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:24,224
Front

2659
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,760
Why and fighting the war

2660
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:33,440
We got to distract from This Is War is going on in the

2661
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:42,144
To give you some scale of like what are only six

2662
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,448
4000 troops deployed in the entire

2663
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:46,240
I-Ready of Europe

2664
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:49,568
I understand

2665
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:55,456
But this would literally be like 90% of our troops in Europe being in space fighting Reptoid

2666
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:58,272
Hard to imagine that no one would notice

2667
02:17:58,528 --> 02:18:00,832
You know nobody has audited the Pentagon budget

2668
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:02,112
4

2669
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:05,184
60 years old

2670
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:11,840
Without 50,000

2671
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:14,656
Dish Anywhere

2672
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:17,472
It's also crazy high number of combat

2673
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:18,496
Sphere like the

2674
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:20,544
Preliminary

2675
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,080
By April 2000

2676
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:25,920
For there were only 20,000 300 troops in Afghanistan

2677
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:29,248
Orion battle is

2678
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:30,528
Double that deployment

2679
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,624
The Troop level in Afghanistan didn't reach 50,000 till the middle of

2680
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,648
2009

2681
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:38,464
What she's talking about would legitimately be

2682
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:41,792
Possible to pull off without noticing

2683
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:45,632
Each of these 50,000 people supposedly fighting in a Ryan

2684
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:47,424
Bill have loved ones in French

2685
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:53,056
It's kind of hard to imagine that none of them would slip up and accidentally reveal that they were off.

2686
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,360
This would absolutely be impossible to

2687
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:56,384
Compartmentalize

2688
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:58,432
If you're that large

2689
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,712
Like it's just crazy

2690
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:08,416
Presumably they would have had to been trained up on how to use the obviously different weapons and tactics

2691
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:13,536
Using space combat well it's nonsensical there's no way that 50,000 people

2692
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:15,072
Let's

2693
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:20,448
Arrow Ford nodes in their own life right now you got 100,000 to keep quiet

2694
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:23,520
And that's for people that's phone number foremost

2695
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:28,640
Of those individuals

2696
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:31,968
Geometric the

2697
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:33,760
Totally

2698
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:40,160
This is this is impossible to imagine the first five years of

2699
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:43,488
Silent

2700
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:44,512
It's ridiculous

2701
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:47,328
I think the frustration that I have

2702
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:48,096
Most

2703
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:50,144
Is in moments like that

2704
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,960
We talked about the minutiae of just

2705
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:55,776
What is 50,000 people were deployed

2706
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:58,336
Anyway it is frustratingly

2707
02:19:59,104 --> 02:19:59,872
Detail Ori

2708
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,200
If we take one step back

2709
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:07,296
We have to always admit that these people are yada yada eating fast

2710
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:15,232
No there's no they all assume the last one

2711
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:21,632
You make a great point

2712
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:22,912
A satellite Travel Wichita

2713
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,192
Goddamn

2714
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:29,056
Kind of brought up there like

2715
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,592
What kind of training

2716
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:31,872
Is

2717
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:33,152
Relevant

2718
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,176
2 space battle

2719
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:40,576
Infantry ground troops in a space battle

2720
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:44,416
It's not the same

2721
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:48,512
Define more f****** Mars has different gravity there you can't breathe

2722
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,072
Here's the trick out your using

2723
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,120
Purely amphibious

2724
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:53,888
Trained

2725
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:56,192
All right so the Navy Seals

2726
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,984
They go from water

2727
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:00,288
Easy step from space

2728
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:01,312
That's tight

2729
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:02,848
At science

2730
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:11,040
Space

2731
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:18,976
I don't think the same things that filter air out of water worksheet

2732
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:20,512
Devices

2733
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:24,864
I don't think it would but I'm not sure

2734
02:21:28,448 --> 02:21:30,496
I don't I don't I think there's some holes

2735
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:31,776
Okay that's fair

2736
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,544
Earth Fare

2737
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,824
So

2738
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,920
You know right now we got some issues with the brexit

2739
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:44,320
Well turns out Marcus

2740
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:49,696
He said there is a group holding it back it is imperative that the British

2741
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:50,464
Are able to

2742
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,232
Come over to the

2743
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,512
The American side

2744
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:53,792
We can't fully

2745
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:54,560
Trust them

2746
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:55,328
This time

2747
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:56,608
Which is strange

2748
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,632
Because they are are

2749
02:21:59,168 --> 02:21:59,680
Allied

2750
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:04,288
Still have brexit has to do with them coming to America

2751
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,312
Weird

2752
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:11,968
This to me is like a real strong indication that whatever is behind a lot of the

2753
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:14,528
The worldview that Terry and Mark have

2754
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,552
Has to do with

2755
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:19,904
Anti un anti-eu height

2756
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,696
Sorry Valenti

2757
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:25,024
Sit up with

2758
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:28,096
Alex and his wife

2759
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:31,424
Is here or her like a Reptoid

2760
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:36,288
Call just sort of targeting these International Organization

2761
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,824
Cooperation

2762
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:38,592
Yeah

2763
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:41,664
It's not really that different

2764
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:43,200
He is to have different

2765
02:22:43,968 --> 02:22:44,480
Costume

2766
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:46,784
It is frustrating

2767
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:49,856
It is really frustrating

2768
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:51,136
Because that is

2769
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:52,416
Fitting Within

2770
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:56,512
What would it What was

2771
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:58,048
Would you call it nationalist

2772
02:22:58,304 --> 02:22:59,072
Populist

2773
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:00,864
Reality of brexit

2774
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:02,400
What the what

2775
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:04,192
Johnson is really doing is

2776
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:05,472
Strip mining

2777
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:06,496
England

2778
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,520
Selling it to America

2779
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:10,080
America billionaires

2780
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:16,992
Exact

2781
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:20,064
Bada bing bada boom

2782
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,368
Yep and that's what sucks about this

2783
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:24,416
I fucken like

2784
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,440
The Escape

2785
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:29,536
These Wacky Wednesday Project Camelot episode

2786
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:31,584
The reality is the first

2787
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,632
The more it's so clear that it's

2788
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:39,264
Whitewashing and apologizing for

2789
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,824
Radically again

2790
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:42,592
You know

2791
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,688
You cannot answer the

2792
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:47,456
This question right

2793
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:51,552
I might be able to

2794
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:56,416
Do you feel like this is

2795
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:01,280
Social media

2796
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,584
Cambridge analytica era of

2797
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:13,312
Migration of space weirdos to that same level

2798
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:15,872
Different

2799
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:19,200
2011 if we were doing the show in 2011

2800
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:21,760
Would we have an unencumbered

2801
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:23,296
Space weirdo experience

2802
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,064
For good

2803
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:27,904
You know I'm saying I don't know for good but yeah I think I think it probably is

2804
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:32,512
I'm not ready to say like

2805
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:38,400
Totally

2806
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:39,936
The distortion

2807
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:46,080
Sort of radicalization on all front

2808
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:48,384
Since 2015 or so

2809
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,664
It probably does

2810
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,688
Affect

2811
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:52,480
Even even

2812
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:55,296
I think that if you look back on

2813
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,600
Earlier

2814
02:24:57,856 --> 02:24:59,392
Interviews that she did

2815
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:06,048
Are the races

2816
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:07,840
A lot of that stuff but I don't

2817
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:10,400
Know how overtly like

2818
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:13,472
Right in line with the

2819
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:16,032
Angling neo-fascist

2820
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,056
World

2821
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:19,616
View narratives with Aldi

2822
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:24,480
How much is this is coming from Mark and how much is it is her interpretation

2823
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:27,552
What Mark said impossible for us

2824
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:30,880
She's just remembering a conversation with a guy who's in prison

2825
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:32,928
Feel like I don't I don't know how much of this is

2826
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,464
Her influence

2827
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,488
He's saying

2828
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,072
But yeah I think for sure I don't know

2829
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,352
Well I supposed to

2830
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:42,144
Question for me is

2831
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:44,448
Parallel

2832
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:47,264
Very similar to when we talked about the

2833
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:52,128
2013 yeah looking at routers

2834
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,152
And you're like

2835
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:55,456
Discuss

2836
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:58,272
Question is

2837
02:25:58,784 --> 02:26:00,320
How much of their

2838
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:01,088
Currants

2839
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:02,624
F****** esneault

2840
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,160
Fascist state

2841
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,440
Was

2842
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:08,256
Simmering below the surface

2843
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:10,560
It's something

2844
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:14,400
Was it always there or is it

2845
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,264
Is the question I can't answer

2846
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:22,848
Yeah who knows

2847
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:29,248
It's context clues from Peebles record right

2848
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:33,600
Adjectives for that

2849
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:40,000
The level to which were seeing on this episode

2850
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:41,280
In a lot of carries

2851
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:42,560
Maurice

2852
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:43,328
Work

2853
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:45,376
I think it is different

2854
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:47,936
I think it has been affected by

2855
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:49,216
Those world

2856
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:51,520
Yeah the change

2857
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:53,312
I think that's the

2858
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:55,104
That's the issue I have with

2859
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:55,872
It's a weight

2860
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:58,176
The word

2861
02:26:58,944 --> 02:26:59,456
Do you know what I mean

2862
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:05,088
Someone talked about

2863
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:06,624
Increase in white Nash

2864
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,392
Terror

2865
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:10,720
Plies though that

2866
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:12,000
All of this

2867
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:12,768
Just that

2868
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:16,864
What year was a bowl

2869
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:21,984
So does that mean every time you use the word emboldened

2870
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,776
Are we really saying that

2871
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,568
This is always been there

2872
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:26,592
In the fascist right

2873
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:30,944
I think

2874
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,992
Two populations

2875
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:34,016
Influencers

2876
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,552
Dodos

2877
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:36,576
It's such a distinction

2878
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:39,392
The influencer is perhaps our embolden

2879
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:40,160
To some extent

2880
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:41,952
People

2881
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,232
AR

2882
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:44,256
Maybe being

2883
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:46,048
Taken down Road

2884
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:51,680
Very good

2885
02:27:54,752 --> 02:27:55,264
Even being a fact

2886
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:57,568
So as

2887
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:58,336
People

2888
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:00,128
If you just take it on a microcosm

2889
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,152
Carrie

2890
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:04,736
She's doing her alien space weirdo staff it's a lot of derivatives

2891
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:11,136
Protocols

2892
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:14,208
You have that like service

2893
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:14,976
Space

2894
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:16,512
And Carrie gets in

2895
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:17,792
Influence

2896
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:20,608
The events that are happening at the world end

2897
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:24,192
Changes a little bit along the way

2898
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:29,056
Right

2899
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:30,592
The audience

2900
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:33,152
Comes along with it not realizing

2901
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:35,712
That the source of information itself is

2902
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:36,736
Yeah

2903
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:43,648
Do the feedback loop between Trump and Fox News

2904
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:46,208
He really does believe in the Ukraine

2905
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:48,768
Conspiracy

2906
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,304
Pushed

2907
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,584
By the propaganda

2908
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:53,376
Supposed to be

2909
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:56,704
And instead wound up

2910
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:57,472
Influence

2911
02:28:58,496 --> 02:28:59,776
And so on and so forth

2912
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:04,640
People who watch

2913
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:05,408
Spock

2914
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,712
Rving change

2915
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:13,856
By the Yeah Yeah Yeahs absolutely not realizing that the source of information

2916
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:14,624
Has been

2917
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,160
Very seriously altered

2918
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,696
Over the past few years

2919
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:22,816
Right but the messaging has changed whether it was good or bad to begin with

2920
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:27,936
Come over the course

2921
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:28,704
Few years

2922
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:30,752
That the audience

2923
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:32,032
Did it

2924
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:35,104
The same source of always got information from

2925
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:37,920
Lose track of

2926
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:38,688
If you don't

2927
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:40,992
Just check in from time

2928
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:43,296
But

2929
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:44,832
It's just life

2930
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:48,160
Special powers I asked mark

2931
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:50,208
If he has special powers and I are

2932
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:51,488
A bit about

2933
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:52,256
My own

2934
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:54,048
And he said yes

2935
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:56,864
Dodger

2936
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:57,888
Further about

2937
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:59,168
What his special

2938
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:00,448
AR

2939
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:01,728
I got I have a gas

2940
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:06,336
The murder other people

2941
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:07,872
Now that's

2942
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:13,248
Telekinesis I would respect

2943
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:14,016
1

2944
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:15,808
If you had said

2945
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:17,600
I don't

2946
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:20,160
That's how good I am

2947
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:24,256
Guy like you just like everybody else

2948
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:26,048
And that's how much I work

2949
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:30,656
That's how hard I do things you know I'm just a human trying to make humans better

2950
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:36,800
Nokia

2951
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:38,080
Pyro

2952
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:39,872
In his defense

2953
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:41,408
That's a good idea

2954
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:43,200
Always have your enemy

2955
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:44,480
Guessing what it is you

2956
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:45,760
Never reveal your

2957
02:30:46,016 --> 02:30:52,160
We talked about all the time

2958
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:56,256
Specific

2959
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:05,728
Star Trek next Generation

2960
02:31:05,984 --> 02:31:07,264
In arbitration

2961
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:13,664
Captain Picard forces the the alien

2962
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:14,944
Jordy

2963
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,736
And they the ship

2964
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:19,808
Is found the source of the power

2965
02:31:20,064 --> 02:31:26,208
I-Ready i-Ready

2966
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:30,560
Mostly remember because it begins

2967
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:31,840
With f****** beta

2968
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:33,632
Hanging out in the Holodeck

2969
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:35,168
Doing a f****** dick

2970
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:35,936
Dickens

2971
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:37,216
Play

2972
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:42,848
I remember your ability to recall certain things

2973
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:44,384
So incredibly

2974
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:51,040
I have a weird trap type brain

2975
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:54,624
Nothing affects me until you accidentally hit a box

2976
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:56,416
Mariota

2977
02:31:57,952 --> 02:31:58,464
Boop boop

2978
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,024
But it is

2979
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:04,096
It's very similar to that like

2980
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:06,400
Arbitration

2981
02:32:06,912 --> 02:32:08,448
Scenario

2982
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:09,984
Get called out

2983
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:14,848
Know your powers are gone cuz we've disabled

2984
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:16,384
Mark is never going to say like

2985
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,688
I can move things with my mind do it

2986
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:19,712
A pencil

2987
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:27,136
The government actually

2988
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:27,904
The powers of

2989
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:30,208
Easy

2990
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:35,072
Oh my God another photon

2991
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:37,120
So

2992
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:37,888
Jordan

2993
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:39,168
Raptors are good

2994
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:45,312
Sure

2995
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,360
They're good

2996
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:48,896
Headstrong

2997
02:32:49,408 --> 02:32:51,200
The Raptors are very difficult

2998
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:52,480
To control

2999
02:32:52,992 --> 02:32:55,552
When you're like a human who's trying to like

3000
02:32:56,832 --> 02:33:02,976
Lead a group of Raptors Jurassic World

3001
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:04,512
Not Pine

3002
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,776
So you saw the rapper

3003
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:19,872
Chris Hemsworth Germany Chris's conspiracy of Chris's

3004
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:22,176
This is not a problem

3005
02:33:23,712 --> 02:33:24,480
Regarding the Rock

3006
02:33:25,248 --> 02:33:26,016
Mark said

3007
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:27,040
Especially

3008
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:27,808
Difficult

3009
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:28,832
Command

3010
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:30,624
They don't obey you

3011
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:32,928
They have

3012
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:33,696
Decided

3013
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:35,232
Before you give an order

3014
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,000
What order

3015
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:37,024
Going to give them

3016
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:39,328
Goodwin

3017
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:40,608
First of all

3018
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:47,008
Do dogs run

3019
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:50,592
Also it's Chris Pratt

3020
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:52,384
And so you can

3021
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:54,176
Discussion with

3022
02:33:55,712 --> 02:33:56,224
About

3023
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:57,760
You on the order

3024
02:33:58,784 --> 02:34:00,320
Because they've already figured out all the

3025
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:08,000
So he says

3026
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:09,792
Therefore

3027
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:11,328
To command them

3028
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,352
However

3029
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,144
Mark is known

3030
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:15,424
Quiet

3031
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:18,752
Loyalty

3032
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:19,776
And love for

3033
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:21,568
They love him so much

3034
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:24,896
Even though they know all the angles ahead of time

3035
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:26,432
He's just unique

3036
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:29,504
He's just unique usciences special

3037
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:31,040
I just don't know what to do with it

3038
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:34,624
I am on honestly

3039
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:35,648
Somehow

3040
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,440
I'm far more on board with

3041
02:34:37,696 --> 02:34:38,464
Raptors loving

3042
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:39,744
Chocolate

3043
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:42,304
It's tamahau him just being a great come

3044
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:43,072
Commander of

3045
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:44,864
He's a rapper rapper

3046
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:45,632
Ridiculous

3047
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:49,472
It's bananas absolutely bananas

3048
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:50,752
Because he's so good

3049
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:51,776
And because

3050
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:53,824
Situation in the world is so severe

3051
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:56,128
There's so many of these alien

3052
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,408
Battles iqc

3053
02:34:57,664 --> 02:34:58,176
See the fires

3054
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:00,224
It in Brazil

3055
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:01,248
He is Amazon

3056
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:02,528
You see

3057
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:06,112
Trouble in Africa

3058
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:09,184
They're all just covering up for alien battles

3059
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:11,232
You need people like

3060
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,000
Like Mark

3061
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:13,280
You need him

3062
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:14,304
And that's mean

3063
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:17,632
He's probably going to get out of prison soon cuz they need it

3064
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:20,192
Regarding Mark's new job

3065
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:23,008
And you can see more about this in interview

3066
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:24,032
10

3067
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:26,080
Basically

3068
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:29,152
I had raised the idea that maybe

3069
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:30,944
He is being trained

3070
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:31,968
In his job

3071
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:33,248
Because he's handling

3072
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:34,272
Like large numbers

3073
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:36,064
Maybe

3074
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:39,904
Technical building lenses for

3075
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:40,672
Medicare

3076
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:41,696
As I understand it

3077
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:42,976
And Mark is in

3078
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:44,512
Charging all of that

3079
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:46,048
It looks like

3080
02:35:46,304 --> 02:35:46,816
He's learning

3081
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:48,352
New computer programs

3082
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:49,376
And so on

3083
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:51,168
Anna

3084
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:54,752
The military may actually be testing him

3085
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:56,800
To see if he is able

3086
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:57,824
To be read

3087
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,616
Recruited into the secret

3088
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:01,408
PACE program

3089
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:03,968
You can handle the current state of play

3090
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:04,992
That are military

3091
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:05,760
Stealing

3092
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,320
And Mark

3093
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:09,856
Agree that this is

3094
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,136
Possible

3095
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:13,184
An exact mark

3096
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:14,976
More than

3097
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:15,744
Ableton

3098
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:17,792
He's great

3099
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:18,560
Okay

3100
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:20,608
We have ventured

3101
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:22,144
Purely into demo

3102
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:24,448
Yeah

3103
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:32,640
He's still Vester Stallone he's being brought back for one last job because there's one

3104
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:41,344
That's the first thing comes your mind facts

3105
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:47,744
Prepared

3106
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:53,376
Bright technology

3107
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:54,912
Etc

3108
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:59,776
It's frustrating

3109
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:01,568
Creative

3110
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:02,592
Yeah

3111
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,896
World to live in where

3112
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:10,784
Becky's going to get out of prison cuz they need him to fight these

3113
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:12,832
Impossible to deal with

3114
02:37:13,088 --> 02:37:14,880
Anybody else

3115
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:21,280
Well you're not going to able to handle this much easier

3116
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:22,304
Because we have

3117
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,352
Just a couple more Clips life

3118
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:26,656
Cuz there's not much like

3119
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:28,192
Tipsters largely

3120
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:32,544
Like what we talked about.

3121
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,312
The

3122
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:34,592
Mixing in

3123
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:38,432
Fun goofy dumb space bowl-shaped real world

3124
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:40,224
White washer

3125
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:43,296
But you heard earlier that Carrie got a new car

3126
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:49,952
We're going to learn a little bit

3127
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:50,976
More

3128
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:51,744
She got that new

3129
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:52,512
Computer

3130
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:53,536
And

3131
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:55,328
This is a little bit

3132
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:57,376
But also

3133
02:37:58,656 --> 02:37:59,680
It's grandiosa

3134
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:01,728
So any

3135
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:02,752
Financial

3136
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:03,776
Help you can give

3137
02:38:04,032 --> 02:38:04,544
Would be

3138
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:06,080
Very welcome

3139
02:38:06,592 --> 02:38:08,384
To help fund the snooker

3140
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:10,176
Computer that I now have

3141
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:11,200
And have had to

3142
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:12,480
Credit card

3143
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:14,528
I will deduct it

3144
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,320
Eventually in April

3145
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:18,112
I had to

3146
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:21,440
And

3147
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:23,744
Payments on it

3148
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:27,328
Which races

3149
02:38:28,352 --> 02:38:28,864
Computer

3150
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:30,144
So any don't

3151
02:38:31,936 --> 02:38:32,448
Preciate it

3152
02:38:32,704 --> 02:38:33,472
At this time

3153
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:36,800
With an audience of 232

3154
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:39,360
Thousand subscribers and

3155
02:38:40,128 --> 02:38:42,176
Actually 63 million

3156
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:43,456
Worldwide

3157
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:46,016
Viewers it seems.

3158
02:38:46,272 --> 02:38:47,808
Small donation

3159
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:48,832
From

3160
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:51,648
Quite well

3161
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:53,696
Perhaps

3162
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:54,720
Something that

3163
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:55,744
Consider

3164
02:38:57,792 --> 02:38:58,304
So that

3165
02:38:58,816 --> 02:38:59,328
You very much

3166
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:00,096
To do so

3167
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:01,120
And

3168
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:02,656
I will continue to

3169
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:08,032
I don't have any like

3170
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:14,432
Interesting kicking her at all but I like the idea computer on a credit card

3171
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:19,296
The reason I play that clip is because there are it's like this is Philemon

3172
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:23,136
Business like this donation

3173
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:30,304
And great I mean like you're doing work on some level that you should

3174
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:31,840
3 million people list

3175
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:33,120
It's really helpful

3176
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:34,656
That's crazy

3177
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:40,800
Go to Project

3178
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:43,872
Downloads there are

3179
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:45,152
II

3180
02:39:45,664 --> 02:39:51,808
The world listens to me

3181
02:39:56,928 --> 02:39:57,440
Okay

3182
02:39:58,720 --> 02:39:59,744
There are very few things

3183
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,536
But I am very good

3184
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:03,840
But somehow financial literacy

3185
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,632
And

3186
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:07,168
God dammit

3187
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:13,824
Every f****** company run 0% interest promotions on all of these things

3188
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:17,408
Find one of those that has a 12% interest option

3189
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:23,808
Keep your credit score high and then later on you can cancel

3190
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:25,088
Adoption

3191
02:40:25,344 --> 02:40:30,464
As long as you make payments on that you can keep going and paying this

3192
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,744
With 0%

3193
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,608
Indefinitely and the fact that she doesn't know that she doesn't know

3194
02:40:38,912 --> 02:40:39,680
That's a good point

3195
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:44,032
And also I should say that this episode is so

3196
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:46,080
F****** heavily monetized

3197
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:48,128
It's an hour long and it's

3198
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:50,176
Broken up by

3199
02:40:50,688 --> 02:40:51,456
Hunza

3200
02:40:51,712 --> 02:40:52,224
Commercials

3201
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,248
Really yeah

3202
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:55,040
I had to edit out commercial

3203
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:57,344
No yeah absolutely like

3204
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,672
Like is a recording it from the YouTube

3205
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:03,488
It's just 880's interrupted by commercials like

3206
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:06,304
An hour probably like 6 commercial

3207
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,584
Coming

3208
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:09,888
No

3209
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:12,960
If so they would not have had those ads in there

3210
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:17,056
So whatever.

3211
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:18,592
I don't know how much

3212
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:20,640
I don't know how much

3213
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:24,480
Like honestly I don't because YouTube is never been an interest of mine

3214
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:27,040
I know

3215
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:31,392
How many pennies do you make for a Silverado

3216
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:32,160
But

3217
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:35,744
Her ads videos are heavily monitored

3218
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:36,768
So

3219
02:41:37,024 --> 02:41:39,584
She is making some money on that front

3220
02:41:40,608 --> 02:41:41,120
Like

3221
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:42,656
I don't know

3222
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:45,472
The fee structure

3223
02:41:46,496 --> 02:41:47,264
What I do know

3224
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:49,312
Hi there she is

3225
02:41:50,848 --> 02:41:51,360
Or

3226
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:53,920
You know how to Leverage

3227
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:55,456
CareCredit

3228
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:56,992
Could be a combination of both

3229
02:41:57,248 --> 02:42:01,856
Although like 50,000

3230
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:07,232
Yeah that dude has imprisoned episode where they recorded

3231
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:08,768
Call from him in prison

3232
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:11,584
Tampa Bay has Iran bears

3233
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:12,864
What is the sadnam

3234
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:17,984
From Mega Med Episode 12

3235
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,776
Sloth

3236
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:23,104
But I honestly also think that she's

3237
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:24,384
About

3238
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,152
Some of this

3239
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:31,552
Will also be

3240
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:32,576
Be considering going to

3241
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:33,344
Turkey

3242
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:34,624
Being invited

3243
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:35,904
In Romania

3244
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:37,184
So these things

3245
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,464
Are possible

3246
02:42:38,976 --> 02:42:41,280
I do not get paid much

3247
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:43,328
Out there

3248
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:44,352
I also

3249
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:45,632
Half and half

3250
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:49,984
So this is

3251
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:51,520
Welcome to the Red Dog Life

3252
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:53,056
Consider as well

3253
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:55,872
Here's the reason that I think that's troubling

3254
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:59,968
She's been talking about the Yelm conference this

3255
02:43:00,224 --> 02:43:01,504
A bunch of this episode

3256
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:06,112
And every single article that I was able to find about the conference and they were talking about the

3257
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:06,880
The price

3258
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:13,280
Of admission to the cosmic Symposium Mission all of the money goes

3259
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:14,048
Go to the speakers

3260
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:18,912
So if $250 is the ticket price for that

3261
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:20,960
It looks like 20 people

3262
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:22,240
Paper that covers

3263
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:23,008
Travel

3264
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:24,032
All the speaker

3265
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,080
Easily covers

3266
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:28,640
People having to fly in for their

3267
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:30,432
Whatever price

3268
02:43:30,688 --> 02:43:32,480
Cost to do these things

3269
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:33,504
Is minim

3270
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:35,296
Now

3271
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:38,368
The flip side of that is if you're not getting

3272
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:41,952
Go speak let's say in Romania

3273
02:43:42,464 --> 02:43:43,744
Then you're not a draw

3274
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:46,816
What you're doing is not important

3275
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:53,728
Are you a numerated

3276
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:58,592
I understand the desire to

3277
02:43:59,872 --> 02:44:02,176
I was slightly different

3278
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:03,712
You can't have it be like

3279
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:07,552
We have 63 million viewers around the world

3280
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:08,832
And say

3281
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:11,392
I have to pay to go do the

3282
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:12,928
Trips

3283
02:44:13,184 --> 02:44:14,464
You can have one or the other

3284
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:16,768
You can be like what

3285
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:23,424
I'm never going to Bluff them say that we have the biggest audience of the world

3286
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:28,032
Did you compare it to other large bachata

3287
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:34,688
I'm never going to pretend we are the biggest thing in the world and then go speak for

3288
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:35,456
For free

3289
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:40,064
I'll go speak for free because we did not have a very large audience

3290
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:40,832
Honestly

3291
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:44,160
The thing that I am

3292
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:45,440
Amazed by with

3293
02:44:45,696 --> 02:44:46,208
This podcast

3294
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:48,256
I have

3295
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:51,072
Certain up at 2 a.m.

3296
02:44:51,328 --> 02:44:52,096
Become a draw

3297
02:44:52,864 --> 02:44:55,168
For 225 people

3298
02:44:55,424 --> 02:44:56,192
In certain region

3299
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:57,984
And I will tell you something right now

3300
02:44:58,496 --> 02:44:59,520
That is

3301
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:00,288
Not

3302
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:09,504
There are plenty of headliner board they're plenty of Headliners that I have worked with over the years

3303
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:14,368
Stoked about it

3304
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:15,136
Jirachi

3305
02:45:16,672 --> 02:45:17,952
You as opposed to

3306
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:21,792
They're tricked by advertising or something

3307
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:23,328
It's not like somebody

3308
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:26,144
If you would like

3309
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,872
My point is that like with this

3310
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,664
I just need to play

3311
02:45:38,432 --> 02:45:39,456
Like I

3312
02:45:39,712 --> 02:45:40,736
I don't

3313
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:41,760
Resent

3314
02:45:42,784 --> 02:45:45,088
Carrie saying I have to put this

3315
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:46,368
Computer on my credit card

3316
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:48,928
And if you like what we do please don't

3317
02:45:49,184 --> 02:45:54,816
I don't resent that at all I also in a vacuum don't resent her overblown

3318
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:57,632
Like I understand darcizzle

3319
02:45:58,656 --> 02:46:02,496
16 bigger than they are

3320
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:04,543
I bet

3321
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:08,383
Them being combined and also being in service oven

3322
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:09,151
Inflating

3323
02:46:10,943 --> 02:46:12,735
Information from a murderer

3324
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:19,391
That is alternating lefun and then the other side of it is whitewashing atrocities

3325
02:46:19,647 --> 02:46:20,927
Yeah I can't get around that

3326
02:46:21,183 --> 02:46:23,487
And it bums me out to be like hey

3327
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:24,511
Listen

3328
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:26,047
This is Lady

3329
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:30,399
You are doing this thing and look it's sad

3330
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:33,727
When you're talkin about needin put this computer on credit card

3331
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:35,519
Andy donations

3332
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:37,567
No one pays me to give speeches

3333
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:39,103
It makes me sad

3334
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:41,407
Insult you or like

3335
02:46:41,663 --> 02:46:43,711
Critique

3336
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:44,991
Put

3337
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:46,783
This in this

3338
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:50,623
What disease is a long

3339
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:53,183
Stretched out version of an ad

3340
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:58,559
With Alex whenever he's trying to kill you

3341
02:46:58,815 --> 02:47:00,095
We got specials

3342
02:47:00,351 --> 02:47:02,655
That special ever Easter sales going

3343
02:47:03,423 --> 02:47:05,983
It's the same kind of thing but stretched out

3344
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:08,799
You have the entire presentation over

3345
02:47:09,055 --> 02:47:10,847
50 minutes or whatever and then

3346
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:12,127
Then this at the end

3347
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:13,919
Like it still

3348
02:47:14,175 --> 02:47:15,455
Still trying to like

3349
02:47:15,711 --> 02:47:17,247
We've done this at now

3350
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:18,527
I just don't rush

3351
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:21,087
No

3352
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:23,391
On a certain level

3353
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:26,207
If she is correct about having

3354
02:47:26,719 --> 02:47:32,863
T3 million views is not possible

3355
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:34,399
Videos

3356
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:35,423
So is there 6

3357
02:47:35,679 --> 02:47:36,191
63 million

3358
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:36,959
Views

3359
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:38,751
Not

3360
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:42,079
Yeah like

3361
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:46,943
Back when you're talking about the monoculture a trillionaire

3362
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:48,991
Call whatever

3363
02:47:57,951 --> 02:47:58,463
You know

3364
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:03,839
Content

3365
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:04,863
So

3366
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:11,007
If you if she was if she was at Nickelodeon

3367
02:48:13,823 --> 02:48:14,847
3 million

3368
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:18,687
At least five or six dollars

3369
02:48:18,943 --> 02:48:22,015
Million people watched

3370
02:48:22,271 --> 02:48:25,087
Anyone of her videos

3371
02:48:25,343 --> 02:48:26,623
Almost three times

3372
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:32,255
Elon Musk going on Joe Rogan show

3373
02:48:32,767 --> 02:48:34,303
It's not it's like if you have

3374
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:38,399
63 billion people who watch your videos over 12 years

3375
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:39,679
Those aren't

3376
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:41,471
63 billion unique

3377
02:48:41,727 --> 02:48:42,751
People

3378
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:45,311
It's the same Five Guys

3379
02:48:45,567 --> 02:48:46,847
It's

3380
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:49,919
Number over the top

3381
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:51,199
It's not the same as

3382
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:52,735
You put out one product

3383
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:54,783
Do you have any eyes on it

3384
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:56,319
Well I think it's

3385
02:48:57,599 --> 02:48:59,135
Partially a function of

3386
02:48:59,391 --> 02:48:59,903
Of the

3387
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:00,927
The

3388
02:49:01,183 --> 02:49:01,695
I mean I guess

3389
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:02,975
Supposed

3390
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:04,767
Niche

3391
02:49:06,303 --> 02:49:06,815
Entertainment

3392
02:49:08,863 --> 02:49:10,399
Really knows how much

3393
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:11,935
Time is worth anymore

3394
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:13,727
You know like

3395
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:19,871
You see it so often with free Lord knows well I mean Sports Illustrated

3396
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:20,895
And how they is

3397
02:49:21,919 --> 02:49:24,735
Troy their staff and now they're trying to create those

3398
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:26,783
Like almost multi-level marketing

3399
02:49:28,063 --> 02:49:29,855
Writers were it's like

3400
02:49:30,111 --> 02:49:33,439
Your best bet is 80 hours a week

3401
02:49:33,695 --> 02:49:34,207
And you make

3402
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:35,231
10 bucks

3403
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:42,911
I probably paid $3 an hour for the work I do here

3404
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:47,775
You know it's it's but it's

3405
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:48,799
Tutu pink

3406
02:49:49,311 --> 02:49:51,103
Nobody really knows what the valuation is

3407
02:49:51,615 --> 02:49:53,663
No

3408
02:49:56,223 --> 02:49:56,991
For that no

3409
02:49:57,247 --> 02:49:58,783
While at the same time I can't

3410
02:49:59,295 --> 02:49:59,807
Endorse

3411
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:09,535
Yeah yes yeah I could be fine with all of the

3412
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:10,815
The end of the episode

3413
02:50:11,071 --> 02:50:12,607
If the other stuff was

3414
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:19,263
The other stuff being there makes it really tough for me to swallow feel really bad or or

3415
02:50:19,775 --> 02:50:20,287
RPD

3416
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:22,591
100%

3417
02:50:22,847 --> 02:50:28,991
It's tough it's tough week we have this supposed to be

3418
02:50:29,247 --> 02:50:32,319
To get backspace

3419
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:39,231
You still see shades of the modern world you still

3420
02:50:39,487 --> 02:50:40,255
Fifty Shades of

3421
02:50:42,303 --> 02:50:42,815
Fascist

3422
02:50:43,071 --> 02:50:46,399
Did Jason propaganda put out in different ways

3423
02:50:48,703 --> 02:50:52,031
I mean that's just the reality of it there is there is no real

3424
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:54,079
Anymore

3425
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:56,639
I wonder if you're listening to this

3426
02:50:59,199 --> 02:50:59,711
Not too late

3427
02:51:00,223 --> 02:51:01,759
Plenty of places are offering

3428
02:51:02,783 --> 02:51:03,807
Zi less than

3429
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:04,575
2%

3430
02:51:06,111 --> 02:51:08,159
You can get a new credit card

3432
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:11,999
High interest rate APR credit card

3433
02:51:12,255 --> 02:51:17,631

That's one of those names know where you're like

3447
02:52:11,647 --> 02:52:15,743
At this point in time in 2019 year like

3448
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:17,535
I don't know I might be a much more

3449
02:52:17,791 --> 02:52:23,423
I'd like a far more common name and then we realized

3450
02:52:27,263 --> 02:52:27,775
I don't know how to pronounce

3451
02:52:29,311 --> 02:52:30,079

Waste

3460
02:53:06,175 --> 02:53:09,247
A few years back so what I worked at the Laugh Factory

3461
02:53:10,527 --> 02:53:16,159
I was doing stand-up I became a regular at the last

3462
02:53:16,415 --> 02:53:20,255
Cuz you're very talented

3463
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:21,791
Jamie

3464
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:24,607
The owner of the Laugh Factory

3465
02:53:24,863 --> 02:53:27,935
Jamie Masada

3466
02:53:28,447 --> 02:53:30,495
And he became like a good friend of mine

3467
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:37,919
Gave me his phone number to cell phone number call me on the cell phone all the time

3468
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:40,223
What's up buddy

3469
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:44,319
He wanted me to start a show there and his idea for it was

3470
02:53:53,791 --> 02:53:56,351
What about

3471
02:53:56,607 --> 02:53:57,119
Female comic

3472
02:54:03,775 --> 02:54:09,919
Like we put a beard on

3473
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:11,967
Is a business as always

3474
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:14,015
Yeah it was

3475
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:18,623
That I would hang out with him then

3476
02:54:19,647 --> 02:54:25,279

3478
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:33,471
Stories about like the early days of the Laugh Factory in La Pryor and Carl

3479
02:54:35,007 --> 02:54:38,591
They were rambling f****** stories

3480
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:43,711
Cat being

3481
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:45,247
Disabled

3482
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:46,015

02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:51,903
People be sleeping there.

3486
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:52,671
F***** up

3487
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:53,439
He's great

3488
02:54:54,975 --> 02:54:57,791
Posada is necessarily like a bad person

3489
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:04,191
But he is so distracted by all these dumb ideas

3490
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:05,727
Interpreted as a bad

3491
02:55:05,983 --> 02:55:07,263
Nea

3492
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:08,799
Whatever

3493
02:55:09,311 --> 02:55:09,823
I was

3494
02:55:10,335 --> 02:55:16,479
I was hanging out with Jamie

3495
02:55:16,735 --> 02:55:17,759
Frank and talking about

3496
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:21,855
A show I eventually ended up doing it called the

3497
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:24,927
Peoples Temple of Comedy

3498
02:55:25,183 --> 02:55:30,559
Comedy

3499
02:55:30,815 --> 02:55:32,095
Did not do that okay

3500
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:32,863
It did not work

3501
02:55:33,119 --> 02:55:33,887
The show is a disaster

3502
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:35,679
But it was concept

3503
02:55:35,935 --> 02:55:37,215
Subways

3504
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:38,495
They made us do it

3505
02:55:38,751 --> 02:55:39,519
Sunday

3506
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:40,287
Styx

3507
02:55:40,543 --> 02:55:46,687
It was a disaster I had another idea for a great like live comedy show

3508
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:50,271
Another person would be

3509
02:55:50,527 --> 02:55:51,551
Right

3510
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:54,111
Essentially a podcast on stage

3511
02:55:54,367 --> 02:55:55,391
Eventhubs

3512
02:55:55,647 --> 02:56:01,791

They said no.

3515
02:56:06,911 --> 02:56:10,239
I was hanging out with Jamie one night and Dom Irrera was in town

3516
02:56:10,495 --> 02:56:13,055

3517
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:14,079

Orchids

3539

Continue to be a metaphor for

3548
02:58:05,951 --> 02:58:06,975
Working Man against

3549
02:58:07,487 --> 02:58:09,023
Onslaught of automation

02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:14,911

Florence and the Machine

02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:34,367
I would prefer

3558
02:58:34,623 --> 02:58:38,719
