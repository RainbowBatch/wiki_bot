1
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for this knowledge B B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Do you like to sit around cower in fear and fly over

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,680
A little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Every year is just like allowed planes

8
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
It happens like this is annoying

9
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
And then

10
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
Your passes and it happens again

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Yeah you know and I always look around and see people without

12
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Houses and then I see the billion billion dollars flying overhead and I think thanks Chicago you bunches

13
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
I mean it's loud

14
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,584
Coronavirus

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
That's true that's true and it inspires the sense of jingoistic

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
Which I think is what we really appreciate right and I think sometimes I will be lol like Lookout

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,384
Over the lake I'd like to do that

18
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
I remember I saw would float like daughter years ago and I was like wow

19
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
About my day

20
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
What's going on

21
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
Dan I have a quick question

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
What's your bright spots

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,608
My brakes but today Jordan is I wrote a joke

24
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
What's a rotor joke joke

25
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
I mean I came up with a joke

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
And

27
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
I didn't look it up I don't know if someone's tweeted this

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
It could be derivatives but it made me laugh

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Dictionary s*** again so I'll just have to live with it

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
I think a lot of people like to know like

31
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
How did this happen

32
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
How did

33
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,144
How to get inside the creative mind

34
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
This Dojo came to me when I was doing laundry

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Okay

36
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,800
So that's sort of the sort of the right setting

37
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
It was a joke

38
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,200
Dryer sheets dryer than what

39
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,344
Criminal Just repeat that alright

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
I like it

41
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184
I want the driest sheets

42
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,120
I have to admit that would be that reminds me so much

43
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
Like a fantastic Mike Wiley joke telling the joke and no one laughs and there's just me in the background

44
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
I'm just going like

45
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
This might be brilliant but I might be the greatest thing I've ever heard

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,456
Just losing my s*** the entire audience turns around and likes

47
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
Why are you doing this

48
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,648
Good

49
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,768
I'm sure that's a joke that someone has made before but I tickled myself quite a bit with that

50
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
My bright spot then is

51
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
I was walking over here

52
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
As I normally do

53
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
And assemble back upon that great Jessie Ware album

54
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
And I'm addicted to Spotlight while I walk

55
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
Down the street singing along very loud

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
Realized

57
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
It's time for me to get back into disc

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Okay

59
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,088
For a while going to listen to a lot of discos

60
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,696
Italo disco.

61
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,327
When I was growing up I was part of that

62
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
You know Aiden

63
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
My town was

64
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,983
20 years behind so they have just figured out that rocking disco were fighting it like is a 9

65
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Okay

66
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
It took me like 10 years

67
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Till I watch

68
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
Documentary has like oh yeah it's entirely about race

69
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:38,015
Rockin disco the height the hatred that rock people had for disco with

70
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Well

71
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,951
I think there was a lot of that I think I would that did underlie alot of it

72
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
I think

73
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
Some of the ACT

74
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
We're kind of corny too though

75
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Square a little bit

76
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,263
The Bee Gees maybe lacked a little Edge

77
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
There was that the same time that was all of it would be

78
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
Do you like some of those Circle things that we're going on

79
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,623
I give you that disco get down with your bad self or

80
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
Get on down get on down with your bad self

81
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Today we are going to talk about

82
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
A bit of time from last week

83
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Alex's show

84
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Are we talkin about

85
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,191
The 18th to the 20th

86
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
2021 B

87
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
That was too fast

88
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
I mean

89
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
I can't I can't not address the elephant in the room charged regarding

90
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
January 6th protests

91
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
People have given

92
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
A lot of

93
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
Hey

94
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
What do you guys think about this type messages

95
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,143
Am I I've surveyed some of the landscape of some of the commentary that's going around on social media time

96
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
Disappointed

97
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
No I think

98
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,615
What what I wanted to do was I wanted to start on Wednesday and go through Friday Wednesday through Friday

99
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
I think get us 20in troyer's

100
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
Charge this might be our first how not to cover Owen Shroyer episode

101
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
But I realize that I think there's too much anticipation

102
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,303
We're going to start with actually Owen Shroyer war room

103
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,399
Show from Friday

104
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
Alright back in time

105
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
Experience Alex Jones has passed through the end of last

106
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
Okay then in that case

107
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
I demand you do one thing at a certain point

108
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
Pause during the middle of one of those Owen Shroyer clips and then say

109
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
I bet you're all wondering how we got

110
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
Advent Advent

111
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
It has to happen like that how about I El kabong you

112
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,583
I'm in you wake up kabong

113
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,935
And then you wake up and we're talkin about Wednesday though

114
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,799
Little moments

115
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:13,919
Some folks who are walking I think that's a great idea

116
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
Sinjin

117
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
Desiree thank you so much right now.

118
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,647
Text Desiree Heart full of spiders

119
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:30,047
Rapture princess versus Obama Decepticon

120
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:43,359
Thank you very much and also big shout-out to Brian in honor of

121
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Vaseline and the cult

122
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,831
Brian made a donation to The Seal Conservatory

123
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Need

124
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
I love this

125
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
It's amazing to me that somehow once again we have done something that we can

126
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Fall behind on with Jeff

127
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
Yeah yeah definitely

128
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
What if we just did what episode

129
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,359
45 minutes to The Testament to how

130
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,711
Generous and charitable and wonderful people who listen to the show are credible

131
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
It's a real

132
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Humbling

133
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Anything to be

134
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
Have

135
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
Animals that are backed up on

136
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Other people have like

137
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,655
Oh Joe Rogan fans will gang up on you on the internet they're all I got and our fans will be like

138
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
Adopt an animal

139
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Jordan

140
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Yes

141
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
I know that

142
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
We've already

143
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Ruined

144
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
The news

145
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
So don't try got charged

146
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
For the January 6th

147
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Guess who's coming out

148
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
Theoretically has to have reported

149
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Perturbed

150
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,375
We will learn more on this this episode that he hasn't held Monday morning

151
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
To show up at the Austin Police

152
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
If he does not demand

153
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
The trial by jury

154
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Fiore combat

155
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Absolutely

156
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
I'll fight anybody from Alex's show before we go

157
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Owens business

158
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Linden

159
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
The Clown

160
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Jose

161
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
What is the code for today

162
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
It's not a nice way to Colors Jose clown face

163
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
What are you up to say send it

164
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
It's very uncommon for us to cover and Owen Shroyer

165
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Episode

166
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
And part of the reason

167
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
The only reason we are is because he got charged

168
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,367
I wanted to see how the actual episode itself was

169
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
Because a universal clip that's going around

170
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
On the social media the like little clip of him saying that he's going to declare his innocence

171
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,703
As much as I could of course I would still give more information than necessary

172
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
We will listen to that clip but I wanted

173
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
To see what else was going on on the show

174
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
State of Mind

175
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
And here is where we get

176
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
Start Capital Has Fallen

177
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Not quite.

178
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
I'm in Hawthorne Troy with you for the next 3 hours we have guests joining us today

179
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Joe Biggs attorney

180
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,999
Joe Biggs a political prisoner being tortured in jail right now

181
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
Because of the big Live January 6th is attorney Dan Hall is going to be joining me coming up in the next segment

182
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
Who makes the announcer that there's a warrant out for his arrest and I think Biggs is a lawyer

183
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
Another guy who worked at Infowars who got arrested

184
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,175
Cuz it was a

185
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Certainly did different things during

186
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,343
Actually was inside the capital of this with the proud boys

187
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
I would have you

188
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,279
Mina pizzagate hadn't happened you might still be working at Infowars and he wouldn't have had to

189
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
Join up with the proud boys

190
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,007
Absolutely correct pizzagate

191
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
I think so much all goes that

192
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
Pizzagate honest I was thinking like this guy might be your lawyer

193
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
It's not having burns on your show

194
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Yeah

195
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,855
Burnt bronze medal made that choice for

196
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
Clip of Owen discussing how there's a warrant out for him

197
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
Alright so here's the deal

198
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Ladies and gentlemen

199
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Couple hours ago

200
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
I was informed by my attorney

201
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Will be on the show shortly there is a warrant out

202
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
For my arrest

203
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
With allegations

204
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Involving

205
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
January 6th

206
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,575
And I will have to turn myself in

207
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
Monday morning

208
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
There's a lot of questions

209
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,071
Some I had answers to some I don't

210
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Yes I was there

211
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
Yes it's not going to be getting into more of this today on the air

212
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
And

213
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
I plan on

214
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Clearing

215
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
Innocent of these charges

216
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
That's the deal

217
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,351
So I'm not going to I'm not going to comment any further on this I'm not going to take any questions on this today

218
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,679
But again I was informed by my lawyer

219
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,775
There's a warrant out for my arrest right now and then I have to turn myself in

220
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Monday

221
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
That's just

222
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
That

223
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
Probably shouldn't even be on here right now but we're going to go ahead and do a broadcast anyway

224
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
Yeah I think he's been studying at the Alex

225
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,887
Pausing Academy not talkin for scratches

226
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,287
Talk about a big dramatic over to understand

227
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
Charge for his actions as it relates to January 6th

228
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,455
That's joining rainbow personalities caught up in this fall

229
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
That piece is that he almost certainly wouldn't be

230
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Beginning charge

231
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,647
If you wasn't already under a deferred-prosecution agreement

232
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
At the time of his actions on the sick

233
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
This is something that is absent from almost every little bit of discussion that I

234
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Seen about this

235
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
And it's so critical violated his parole

236
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
Back in December 2019 and got up and chatted a bunch of bulshit attempting to disrupt a session of the house Judiciary Committee

237
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Stewart's cousin Trump

238
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Impeachment

239
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,551
He made a plea deal where is prosecution will be deferred and ultimately dropped on the condition that he quote

240
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,903
Not break any laws and perform 32 hours of verified community service

241
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
Apparently never did that community service

242
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
According to his charging documents

243
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
From this this charge

244
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
This current one

245
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
On February 5th

246
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,959
2021 Owens lawyer provided documentation that

247
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
I completed 30 hours

248
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Between January 19th

249
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
2021 in February 4th

250
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
2021

251
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
Which means that on January 6th

252
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
2021

253
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,503
Owen had not satisfied any of the conditions of his plea deal

254
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
And thought he was still under a deferred prosecution

255
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,231
Part of his plea deal included him agreeing to quote and not parade demonstrate or Pickett within any of the Capitol building

256
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,423
He also quote agrees not to utter loud threatening or abusive language or engage in any disorderly or disruptive,

257
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
Did any place upon the US Capitol grounds

258
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
Or within any of the Capitol Buildings with

259
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,895
Contempt impede disrupt or disturb the orderly conduct of any session of the Congress

260
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Or either house thereof

261
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,575
Unfortunately he was doing those things on January 6th which means that he violated the terms of his plea deal which he

262
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
He had agreed to

263
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,207
These actions on their own might be the sort of thing that would result in a chart

264
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791
It's because he wasn't involved in the actual storming of the capital as far as I can

265
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
Can tell because you was essentially on probation

266
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
What specifically to do with them not allowing being allowed to protest

267
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Disrupt

268
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,031
Government process unreal

269
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,407
He had over a year during which he could have done his community service or we could have realize that he was barred

270
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
Protesting at the Capitol but

271
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,527
He's too stupid or the Allure of being part of the identity 6

272
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
It was just too enticing

273
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Here we are

274
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
That's what's going on your honor I declare innocence

275
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
I do I do understand the charges now

276
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,095
I did not read the plea deal

277
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Nor did I know that that was part of

278
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
So I am

279
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,751
I would like to stipulate that my lawyer is Robert Beltran

280
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Not guilty

281
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
I don't think you even had

282
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:19,199
Barnes probably wouldn't even give him the details you just like sign here you're like

283
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Do some community service

284
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
I've been pretty consistent why position the drum the available information that I have I don't know if what Alex was doing on that

285
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Constitutes criminal Behavior

286
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,815
It really does seem like he was trying to exacerbate the situation and intensify people's feeling

287
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,143
Until things got out of hand and then he tried to get people to stop

288
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
I'm going into the capitol

289
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
His intentions and actions were

290
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,311
Destructive and spiritually bear some responsibility for the events that transpired

291
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
It's hard for me to breathe

292
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,895
Do the gap between bat and him having legal culpability

293
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Oh and on the other hand

294
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
Did this to himself

295
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,343
I still think that this prosecution if it goes forward probably does more harm than good

296
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,415
Whatever punishment Owens facing is probably miniscule compared to the

297
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
The potential this has the fuel Infowars oppression and victimhood narrative

298
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
We'll see what happens but as far as I can tell

299
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
In this case the government of straight up trying to give Owen

300
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
The get-out-of-jail-free pass for the 2019 disruption case

301
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
I need didn't care enough to complete his end of the bargain which were

302
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,383
Was just him doing a little bit of community service 32 hours that's on him

303
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Yeah that's his fault

304
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Yeah he had a year

305
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,575
They are so incapable of doing something for not money

306
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
That he couldn't even do it to avoid jail time

307
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Yeah like that's how it wouldn't it would result in jail time unless he violated these Pacifica

308
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Her prosecution and he did

309
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Yeah

310
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Your honor in my defense

311
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
If we had one

312
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,079
You wouldn't be charging me I'm so even with this like violation of it

313
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Still can't see him having

314
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Any kind of

315
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Punishment coming his way

316
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
That would get him to

317
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Rollover on Alex

318
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,903
What is there for him to roll over on nothing as it relates specially as it relates to the 6th

319
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
I don't know

320
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Iuic

321
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,351
I see a bit of this on on social media

322
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
I think I

323
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Think that it's always kind of unwise

324
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
2

325
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,263
Really care too much about what random people are tweeting

326
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Oh but I do see some

327
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,199
Barely larger accounts and people who some people listen to trying to use this

328
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,527
Alex might be getting charged

329
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,647
In the future I think that's probably a sign that someone selling you a bill of goods

330
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Anime might be Griffin

331
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
I think that

332
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Ignoring

333
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,863
I think that anybody ignoring the aspect of the story

334
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Videos

335
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
The only reason Owen got charged

336
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
Is because of the Deferred prosecution

337
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
They're missing the entire Forest

338
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
For the trees

339
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
Because they're trying to say that Owen and Alex did the same things they were at the same place has frightened got charged that means Alex can get charged

340
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
104 a prosecutor

341
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,087
Alex didn't go and disrupt the house Judiciary Committee

342
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
And so

343
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
Owens too stupid and too young

344
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
That's what it is

345
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,071
And I guess Alex whenever he was pulling these stunts has always been smart enough to go right up to the edge of the line

346
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Like right up

347
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
To the edge

348
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
So close to being prosecuted

349
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,543
Has Decades of practice yeah he's just really good at it

350
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,431
Who thinks seems like he's a Believer to which is why he would go a little bit further than

351
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
That Alec

352
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,855
I don't know if I would chalk it up to being a Believer I think it would be it's more he has something to prove that I like

353
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Text doesn't

354
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,463
He doesn't have a name outside of Infowars

355
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,279
Like if there was a headline Owen Shroyer charged

356
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:50,655
No one cared Infowars reporter Owen Shroyer charged now people are like

357
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
The guy works for Alex Jones

358
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,615
Have an actual identity outside of that that means anything

359
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,199
He does have to go a little bit further

360
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,039
You know try and disrupt the proceedings

361
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,183
Yeah and he has to he has to impress his daddy Alex and Alex doesn't have to do that because you just hired his dad

362
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,743
So it's a little bit of a

363
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,583
You know he's got to be like hey did I do a good job Alex to

364
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
So I don't

365
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,447
Don't think this is necessarily going to be the biggest thing in the world

366
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
Interesting to see how it plays out

367
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
Phone may be gone for a little while

368
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,199
How to do 38 hours of community service have to see the info

369
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,271
Chart get adjusted a little bit

370
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,367
Talk to Robert might be getting called up from the bullpen

371
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
Brutal

372
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,975
I wish I was still curious like how's Owen State of Mind

373
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
Here's where he's at

374
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
Let me just tell you this

375
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,887
And back I'll go to these clips now

376
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Boats

377
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Devil

378
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Worshipping cults

379
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Run the planet

380
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Okay

381
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Time to just get real about this

382
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Got to get real about

383
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
People run all the water Satanist

384
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
People that run our government or satanists

385
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
Lot of mainstream media people are satanists sure

386
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,728
So that's why you look around at all this and none of it makes sense and there's all the inversion and there's all the lying

387
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
And there's all the backstabbing

388
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
And there's all the degeneracy

389
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
And you disable the none of this makes sense

390
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,272
No it did they all make sense once you realize that Satan is running

391
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
I get it now mr. running thing so he violated

392
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,816
Did the terms of his deferred prosecution and was caught

393
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
And you did it on camera to which was

394
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,752
Oh yeah and there was like a promotional materials that advertises he was going to be doing it

395
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
Is very exciting

396
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
What media

397
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
The cops

398
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
Just been waiting there at the 6th and then like hey

399
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
You're here

400
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Goodbye we're going to take you in Augusta

401
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,088
Yeah I know I don't I don't know if that would

402
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Deescalate

403
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Situations

404
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
It's probably good they didn't

405
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,840
And also I probably better and this is probably the reason it's happening now in August

406
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
Probably cuz it easy

407
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:35,520
Very low priority before they finally got

408
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
Nobody saw it was like

409
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Goddamn

410
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,432
I thought maybe somebody who was like on the case of his like

411
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,504
Deferred prosecution whenever we like looking at pictures

412
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,808
Scooby-Doo

413
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,208
It's probably like a series of coincidences that lead to this

414
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Probably

415
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
A long line and also

416
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
All Owens fault

417
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
This is one

418
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
Hundred percent his fault

419
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,032
The world is run by devils

420
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
No it's like he had a restraining order against a f****** Meijer and then he went into the Myers and was like

421
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,808
And then

422
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
So

423
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
Get some bad news

424
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
About his

425
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
During the Middle the show

426
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:32,608
We're back here on the Infowars war room we had Joe Biggs lawyer joining us he can no longer join us

427
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,680
So we will no longer be conducting that interview

428
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Alright

429
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
I wonder why

430
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,616
I'm sorry he said what

431
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
Okay no

432
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
My lawyer is going to be a bad idea to talk to do a big as a lawyer on air right now

433
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000
Joe Biggs and lawyers lawyer has advised him it's a bad idea to talk to you right now

434
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,328
Set a little bit of a sticky situation let's just avoid that

435
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,728
Play the little bit more about Satan Sheila and Satan worshipers and what have you

436
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,824
And there's two things to keep an eye on whenever

437
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
People like Owen

438
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,272
What are they use the terms like degeneracy what they're doing is they're trying to attack

439
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
Lgbtq plus Folk

440
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
Without using specific

441
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
Plausible deniability to the

442
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
Having sex outside of marriage and it's like no your base

443
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
Basically saying that sodomy is wrong

444
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Better if you're trying to say

445
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,496
There's a heavy overlap of that and they're trying to save those things

446
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
Without

447
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Without saying

448
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,408
The piece of that and then the other piece is that this is where I

449
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Realize that Owen Shroyer believes in Illuminati bloodline

450
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,112
That's why all of this stuff is robbing you of your Humanity

451
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
The mask

452
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
The force vaccine

453
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
The degeneracy

454
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
The p***

455
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
The drug abuse

456
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
All of it

457
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
All

458
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Satanism

459
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Satanic cults

460
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Of the World Elite

461
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
Illuminati

462
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Controlling the planet

463
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Ringing in

464
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
There

465
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Oneworld satanic government system

466
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
That's really it

467
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
That's it

468
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,728
This is underwhelming

469
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,544
I would I would even say that

470
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
I mean

471
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
If the X

472
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,664
Explanation for why Owen is getting charged

473
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Is Satanist

474
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Run every

475
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Alright

476
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
How does this further Satan's plan

477
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
I mean

478
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,952
Owen is the right-hand man of the only person who can take them Satan

479
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,280
I mean if I was saying I would look it up and be like

480
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Beneath me

481
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
I wish

482
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
I was listening to this and like

483
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,800
Everytime Owen has these pauses they don't feel the same as Alex's posit now Alex's bosses are either

484
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
They're like very seriously dramatic

485
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,968
Intention

486
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Pause Act

487
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Cuz you can't

488
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,368
This it almost feels like it any minute on my be like

489
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,232
Guys I'm full of s***

490
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,560
Nightfall at any moment it just like I can't do this anymore

491
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
I'm going to prison

492
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
Does war room Have a Gimmick

493
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,288
You know like dude is there is there a gimmick that separates

494
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200
Alex's show from war room just like every episode of the War Room

495
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Aerial combat

496
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
See now that sounds great

497
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,136
I would watch that one Infowars employee sacrifice at the end of every episode of the war

498
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
It's like it's like Doug Loves Movies chatting and then they fight to the death the winter comes back for the next

499
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
70

500
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Three straight

501
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
When

502
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,616
There is no gimmick to the war of it's basically the same thing

503
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
As Alex's show but hosted by Owen

504
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
And maybe

505
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,832
Skews slightly younger in terms of some of the reactionary guess

506
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
They have a terrible

507
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
So

508
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Open talks to

509
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
This woman from Australia about how bad covid lockdowns are there and it's I don't care

510
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
It's a long interview

511
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
It's very boring

512
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
But

513
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
It does lead to some calls

514
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Afterwards

515
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,056
Amanda

516
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,128
They seem to have a very interesting perfect

517
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
Fat lady that you just have mystralia I think I would rather be under Taliban rule

518
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,184
And those Australians right now no I mean like it it's not a joke I mean I don't say this ironically like

519
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Hey hey

520
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,352
Taliban it's obviously not good I wouldn't want to live under the Taliban but they're not making them wearmaster not making them taking

521
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
Taiwan

522
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,008
And we got our own globalist Taliban we're dealing with here

523
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,896
Isn't one of their big complaints about Islam the idea of like people having to wear a hijab

524
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Isn't that like

525
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
Do they call like

526
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
Covid masks

527
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
Facebook burkas

528
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,880
What are you talkin about that one is

529
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
Pretty egregious

530
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:50,560
Listen they're not making people wear masks they're making them wear full-body

531
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
Suits dum-dum even

532
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Even Within

533
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
Iiii

534
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
Don't have

535
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
The same relationship

536
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
With

537
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
Islam that

538
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,896
Let's say Infowars does

539
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Reality

540
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
This doesn't make sense

541
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,552
So and Owen believe that the January 6th

542
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
Was the globalist reichstag

543
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Coronavirus Georgia

544
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
But you can't really talk about it

545
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
Because the cat is it good

546
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
PCAT

547
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Going to get arrested

548
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
Whatever

549
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Whatever term

550
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
We put

551
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,776
The group of criminals that are running this country when it's all said and done and the history books

552
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
Just like the Nazis reichstag event

553
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
January 6th will be known as

554
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,248
Whatever it is Democrats globalist

555
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
That will be there false flag reichstag

556
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
And it's sad that I have to sit here

557
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
A firm believer in free speech

558
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
Affirm practitioner of free speech

559
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Nn

560
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
I'm afraid

561
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
I'm afraid

562
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
To speak my mind today

563
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
Okay

564
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Cuz we no longer live in a freak on

565
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
What a mope

566
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
What a f***

567
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
You know what

568
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Here's the thing

569
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,856
All right and this is like one there's the propaganda of course of being like if we take responsibility for the 6th

570
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
We're f******

571
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,952
You know so we have to say that it's a false flag

572
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
But

573
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
Just saying that

574
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,816
Makes you realize that

575
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
Everyone Towing

576
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Is f****** stupid

577
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
And so is

578
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
Really really dumb

579
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,800
Like you have to know that you are

580
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
So stupid

581
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,128
If you're really going to say

582
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
That you went to the 6

583
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,224
And saw all of your friends there

584
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,040
Burned black lives matter flag the night

585
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:53,184
F****** before screaming in the streets

586
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
False flag

587
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Yourself

588
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
Insane

589
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
Yeah insane

590
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
Also

591
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,264
I tried to put myself in Owensboro session understand that there's a lot of steps that would have to lead up to me being in that position

592
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,360
But I imagine if I Quantum Leap into his body and let's say

593
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,176
And I was I got news of this charge

594
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,504
I would feel so disgusting

595
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
If I didn't

596
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Present it honestly

597
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Two people that like look

598
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:26,464
I had a deferred-prosecution I wasn't supposed to be in the capital.

599
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
This is a bureaucratic thing

600
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
My actions on the six

601
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
Actually have nothing to do

602
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,496
What what I did or didn't do as nothing to do with this charge itself right I just was

603
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
I agreed

604
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,848
To not do the thing that I hate

605
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
Told him I probably could have

606
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
Been there on the 6th and gotten away with it

607
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
Maybe no charges but

608
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:54,368
I'm too much of a selfish prick to have done my community service a gout in a timely manner

609
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
Hey until I was still under this agreement

610
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
And look it look it

611
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,048
I understand why you would want to take this as some kind of a thing where there's

612
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,144
Devil's around or whatever this is on me this one's my fault

613
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
We could talk about how

614
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,104
It is it right for me to have gotten arrested for disrupting the house Judiciary Committee or we can talk about that

615
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,456
This time I agreed to the terms of this thing right violated better

616
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
That is my

617
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
Every man if you care about

618
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,600
Contract log Intergalactic lie so much

619
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:31,744
I think you have to care about contract law here is well and if you have a green to the stipulations

620
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
And break them

621
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
You don't get a say

622
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
What's your belief system

623
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
Atmosphere

624
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,448
So I wouldn't take another call and his guy

625
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,984
He wants to bring back an old Villa

626
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
We all know is falling

627
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
Strings now laughter

628
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
Coolers mating with Trudeau

629
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
Maybe the evil one Hillary Clinton

630
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,552
What if you just meet with your now

631
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
I didn't see that

632
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
I was too busy even walking

633
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
Hillary Clinton might guy

634
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
But yeah it's

635
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,328
We know what I mean look at this brain-dead

636
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Don't be that we have in there

637
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
You think he knows what the hell is going on at

638
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
I mean he can't even stand up

639
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
He's literally

640
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,616
You can't even run a controlled

641
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,712
Press conference but he just he literally reads off the script

642
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,856
Says the name of the reporter that question their supposed to ask when they go off-script he's like hey what are you doing that's not the question I have

643
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
People

644
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
Uvalde Forum how can

645
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,352
Can you see this crap you know like

646
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
How do you make you feel I want to know

647
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
I'll let Democrat or a liberal field right now

648
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
I convinced that

649
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,408
They are just fully demonically possessed at this point and anything that causes you pain they enjoy

650
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
They don't even care if it causes pain to themselves

651
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,272
They didn't is long as it's causing you pain they like

652
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,624
This is this is the conversion of the doing anything to own the libs

653
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah those are trying to reverse that around

654
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:17,472
Remember how student loans and any number of different things were involved

655
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,800
Getting biting elected here we are so no

656
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
We are not happy

657
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Yeah about s***

658
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
Yeah

659
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
I I don't know I

660
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,552
It's it's so weird to me to have like

661
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Hey look in the mirror Dems

662
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
You love Trump

663
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
He talked about having a big

664
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Dick on

665
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,168
You know what are you talkin about a if you are mad that he can't run a press conference

666
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,520
You can't do 32 hours of community service

667
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,104
That's another issue

668
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Should be able to

669
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,736
So yeah this is this is the sort of vibe that we're getting

670
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
From Owen show

671
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
And not good

672
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Museums

673
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
By boring

674
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
Melodramatic

675
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
Yes I am OPI and a giant piece of s***

676
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,328
My big point that I wanted to make on all that he's this

677
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
Deferred prosecution aspect of it

678
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
If this is something that is

679
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,264
Blade out in the charging document for this current charge

680
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
Scorpion so I think

681
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,128
Video Wellness of this dynamic

682
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
Is something that

683
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
Is

684
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
Essential if you have red

685
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,528
The underlying information

686
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,112
Answer when people come to you and they present this otherwise

687
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
Probably a good indication that they haven't actually read

688
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
What this is about

689
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
And what's funny about it

690
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,840
Is not that somebody from Infowars was charged

691
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
For their part in January

692
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
What's funny about it

693
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
Is that it's entirely because he's a lazy piece of s***

694
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
Owen Shroyer

695
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
Could have done all this stuff

696
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
And none of this would happen

697
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
Entirely his fault

698
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
And it's hilarious

699
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:11,648
So are we go back to the 18th kabong

700
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,488
Here's Alex getting into

701
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,584
Same kind of stuff that I wouldn't believe and I was like hey look I don't like Italian

702
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
But compared to the satanic New World Order

703
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,080
Compared to the globalist compared to what they wanted or children

704
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,408
Well the Taliban pale in significance

705
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,832
Doing what they do From a Stone Age caveman like

706
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Perspective

707
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Oh boy

708
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,232
Wow what a f****** wild thing to say

709
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
Of all the things

710
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Yeah

711
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,960
I feel like he's being racist I'm offended on behalf of the Taliban

712
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
What's happening

713
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Yeah

714
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Wow

715
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
Yeah it's it it's

716
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:07,200
Bizarre Bazaar line he's trying to walk

717
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Deep-seated respect

718
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,064
Exit all of these guys have for anyone who really tries

719
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
At the Dominate women completely

720
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
You know they're like

721
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,488
You're going for it man we were trying to do it here but they're just too strong

722
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,048
They're just too strong you guys are f****** doing it

723
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:27,680
Another thing that seems to be going on in the present-day is Alex's talking quite a bit about

724
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
King Arthur

725
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,104
Actually saw the Green Knight a couple nights ago it must be it must be

726
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
Because of that

727
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:43,552
I have not seen that I guess I saw a trailer for it but I'd forgotten about it but I was always a fan of going

728
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
Man it's great it's really good it's a great movie one of them nights that I always enjoy maybe it's just cuz of the name was fun I don't

729
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Remember anything about him

730
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,536
He was like

731
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:59,936
You know what he was kind of an Owen Shroyer typing trying to impress his dad a lot so he

732
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
10 / 10

733
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,520
I've been trying to make up for his mistakes

734
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
He loses

735
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
Gala gala

736
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:14,016
Who else you got

737
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,624
Maryland's in there who else do we have

738
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,720
Starting out old and then aging young Merlin or you talk about the Merlin that ages

739
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
Done with the magician

740
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
The magician

741
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,608
Anyway Alex very much believe the King Arthur's real

742
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,728
In Australia and New Zealand in the United Kingdom and Europe

743
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,032
The US

744
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,568
Is if we forgotten

745
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
The Anglo-Saxon ethos

746
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,944
Of the Knights of the Round Table

747
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,576
Son of Uther Pendragon

748
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
Wait one round table

749
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Of the Lord

750
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
And the Magna Carta

751
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:00,352
I'll save this as many times as needed to be said King Arthur's a real person not a real person

752
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:06,496
Son of Uther Pendragon has no evidence that Luther Pendragon

753
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,080
Know if he's the son of someone he must have existed obvious

754
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
Obviously

755
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Like how

756
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
You realize that Luke

757
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
Is the son of Anakin

758
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
Do you understand Telugu as a real person

759
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:30,304
Poor boy guy that worried BPR leave abandoned even then

760
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
Nobody ever really did the Roundtable

761
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
No

762
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
This is generally very very top

763
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,032
How they organize governments during the feudal

764
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
So

765
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,152
This is one of the harshest add pivots

766
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
I've heard in a long time

767
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:51,040
So I'm warning you ahead of time

768
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
Five presidents have been murdered

769
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
By the way

770
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
Africa

771
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,560
Because they said we're not taking this experimental shot

772
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,376
You saw what happened to them show

773
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
This is a big big big

774
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,336
Yesterday for x29

775
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,408
Every percent off because we're about to run out of it

776
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Fuk was that

777
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Nuts

778
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:27,648
Wow so Alex is just kind of repeating a little blurb from a meme he saw but I couldn't even name the countries in

779
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,184
Africa that he's talking about

780
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
What are the recent deaths of an African country's leader is the prime minister of Cote d'Ivoire

781
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Hardibacker Yoko

782
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
He died of cancer and was an enthusiastic

783
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Supporter of the vaccination

784
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,776
Campaigns are being held by the World Health Organization

785
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
Murdered by satanists Ambrose dollar meaning

786
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,896
I was the Prime Minister of St

787
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
S14

788
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
He died after testing positive

789
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,248
Difficult

790
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,880
There's no evidence that he was that his death was suspicious and anyways

791
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
Assassinated

792
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,464
Pierna Grande

793
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,792
The president of Burundi died after heart attack

794
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Okay

795
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,144
Then there was John magufuli who is the president of Tanzania

796
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
He was pretty out there in terms

797
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
Covid stuff and he was the guy that he

798
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,568
He claimed he got a sample of a papaya tested and it came back positive

799
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,408
He died of heart failure but there's no evidence of Foul Play at all

800
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:26,528
And there's actually been heavy speculation that he might have had covid which was a confounding factor in his heart

801
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Condition door

802
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,696
The reason that Alex can make these kind of outrageous pivots from talking about heads of state being tortured to death

803
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,560
And then discussing his pills are on sale is cuz he knows that nothing you saying means anything

804
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
These leaders work

805
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,120
Gildan Alex knows it

806
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,240
Tell me just the window dressing that he needs to scare his audience into buying a pills

807
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:51,104
Yeah can you imagine how you would actually respond if you believe that leaders of State

808
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
We're being tortured to death

809
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,735
Because they refuse to accept vaccination campaigns

810
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
That were bio weapon attacks against

811
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
The population

812
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,135
Like you wouldn't be like oh yeah and also Hey look

813
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,487
Reason style t-shirts

814
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,863
It's a comedy to believe that that's

815
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,423
How humid should behave

816
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Nonsense

817
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
My God

818
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,287
That is so funny he can act with such abandon

819
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
And like

820
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
Not really care about the pack

821
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:30,271
Text Nikki saying that these people were tortured to death because he doesn't actually believe that they would you don't have to have empathy for murdered heads

822
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
The state if they were not murdered and you don't know who they are and take them out of the equation

823
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:43,071
That you would know about the world that were in right now

824
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,655
No One Is Safe

825
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,703
Might be murdered in a moment

826
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
It does not matter

827
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Yeah it just

828
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
It's nonsense

829
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Anyway

830
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
Mike Lindell some Posey

831
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,223
Is Cyprus a ghost

832
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Didn't go Grace

833
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Inca Gods

834
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
There was a problem

835
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,391
Who have the trumps president again he can pardon Owen

836
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Oh yeah

837
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,255
There were some problems with the symposium

838
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,559
One of them was that

839
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
His information was bad

840
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
Yabby and slid into his DM

841
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,495
That was Montgomery gave him some dirty dossier

842
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,335
And the

843
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,455
Alex is going to try to pretend that this whole Symposium was great

844
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
It was full of evidence that

845
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
But everything was cool and that Trump

846
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
1

847
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
But

848
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,647
There was the poison pill put in

849
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
And that was the

850
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:47,327
Little tiny bit of the big lie the big lie is that

851
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
No problem is

852
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
So much

853
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Of

854
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
Mike lindell's

855
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Argument rest

856
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,567
To all these fake packet captures

857
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
That were what Dennis Montgomery gave him

858
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
It's not that there's a

859
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,783
Tiny little thing that people are focusing on its that the underlying

860
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Keystone

861
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
Right of his argument

862
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
Is from Dennis Montgomery and it's b*******

863
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
But

864
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
You still spot

865
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Answering Alex

866
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
So Alex has

867
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,655
Kind of you know

868
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
I still like Mike

869
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:30,079
Mike still good still sponsoring Alex we would see Alex doing the exact same Owen Shroyer thing like this was

870
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
The false flag attack

871
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,199
Against the rest of us like yeah might just not talk about it

872
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
Loveland OH

873
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
He's doing

874
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,391
Will get his take on that where he's going

875
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
Don't forget

876
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:54,143
I would be in the red right now weather for my Glendale

877
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
What he's doing

878
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,567
A whole lot of

879
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,199
Pillows ground-breaking pillow groundbreaking pillow supposed to be heavy pillows

880
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
I like I just

881
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
It's it's

882
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
So boring

883
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
It's so boring how like

884
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:19,231
The reason the coverage is happening is because of the

885
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,303
It's not it's not that you would be covering

886
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
Michael lindell's Sowell

887
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
And like as a hero

888
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
So happens

889
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,495
I don't believe it

890
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
He talked much about Mike Lindell before you became espanyol

891
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
Interesting

892
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
So I find this next clip to be a little bit

893
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Confusing and

894
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Homophobic

895
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
Great perhaps

896
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
Cool

897
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
But more than that confusing I'm going to need you to help me on the other side to assess this

898
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,215
They're doing it as a poison to sabotage the culture

899
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,543
Thomas China bans all the George Soros

900
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
Men and women together

901
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
Homosexuals in prison

902
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
In China

903
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,271
My point is is that they say that's not allowed here we're strong

904
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
They want to be

905
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
Because I know that's a strong system

906
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
What

907
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,511
And Destroyer

908
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,815
Because multinational Banks own our government

909
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,119
They want to consolidate the government and take

910
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
So

911
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
Is he

912
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
4

913
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Imprisoning

914
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Gay people

915
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,639
Seem to be saying that it creates a strong Society

916
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,943
Well I mean

917
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,527
He's specifically saying that trans people are

918
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Poison

919
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,111
Yes so ugly transphobic

920
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:56,511
So I'm saying that despite him saying I'm not suggesting

921
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:02,399
Prison I'm just saying that they're trying to be like 1950s America when we were the best country that ever been

922
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
Now I'm just saying

923
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,775
It's not good it's a good thing

924
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,151
Yeah we're getting real close to Alex siding with a Chinese about human rights abuses

925
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,943
But not economic

926
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
Skip

927
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
Taliban have good social policies

928
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
It's

929
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Become a parrot

930
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,743
Yeah it is it is very very at mean it's it's just so much like

931
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,839
Look into the abyss the abyss looks back all the people who were like

932
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,959
We need to go to Warren Carroll all the Islamic

933
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Hey you got to give it up to

934
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,055
The Taliban they know how to run an evil organization

935
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
Can I'm just saying

936
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,735
That their policy choices are fantastic I think there are some people on the right who you could categorize that way

937
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
But just for the sake of

938
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Total

939
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Clarity

940
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,903
Alex was not a super harsh warmonger

941
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,231
He's weirder than that

942
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Yeah

943
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:05,119
So I'll take some calls waiting for Michael and Dale to show up cuz Mike

944
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Who's going to be on

945
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
Anymore

946
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,543
And this caller has an interesting theory about what's going to happen with B

947
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
The Alex

948
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Does his

949
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
That's his

950
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
Trademark

951
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
You bet

952
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,735
I called in I think it was Harrison just yes

953
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
Yesterday

954
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
Honestly

955
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,743
False

956
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
Flagstaff

957
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,911
Everything going on especially Afghanistan now

958
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,471
Vacation I mean

959
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
What's

960
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
Stopping them from one Daisy

961
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
News headlines

962
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,663
Biden was poisoned we hadn't even seen him in over a week

963
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:56,063
Crazy crazy

964
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,463
There's no there's no protections we have two presidents

965
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,535
Brother's Keeper

966
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,887
Again Alex can just say that he agrees with this collar is ridiculous

967
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
Stop. Because nothing means any

968
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:16,287
I agree with Ida probably what's going to happen if a false flag assassination

969
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:21,663
That we predicted for every president since we started

970
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Problem

971
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
And here's another thing

972
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
That doesn't mean anything

973
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
And again even drugs report

974
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,255
Headlines

975
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:40,095
Butchers in September vaccines declining Effectiveness against infection

976
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
Is it ever going to get

977
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
I can't believe that Alex expects

978
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,519
The colors to go along with this kind of a roller-coaster s***

979
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,079
Flicka last we heard from Alex about drug use

980
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,895
Telling us for the website had been sold off to the globalist

981
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Speakers

982
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
Bruno

983
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Going along with the election fraud stuff

984
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,183
Now I guess there's a headline metallic likes on The Drudge Report so maybe he's back in charge running the website how would that even work

985
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,999
He broke into the offices

986
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,071
I got to get this one had lineup

987
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
Nothing Alex says means anything

988
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:19,263
Judges of villain and a sellout on the days that he saying things Alex doesn't like and he's a hero when he says things that Alex

989
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Sounds like

990
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:26,431
Bill Maher is the mouthpiece of the globalist until he says something Alex likes and then Alex has a secret

991
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
April long

992
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
Bill Barr is a crusading hero when he's helping

993
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,087
Entropic struck investigations and eating and Shady pardons

994
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,439
And he's a turncoat villain when he won't unilaterally overthrow the election results now

995
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,719
Trumpet power

996
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,303
If you pay attention to how Alex interacts with people in their positions

997
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,119
Print starts to emerge is worth noting

998
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
Alex has to live in a world of absolute

999
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
Daughter black and white

1000
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
It's tempting to say that

1001
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,591
The part is part of the view Because he believes that he's fighting

1002
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,151
A literal devil on behalf of God

1003
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
Trying to find a middle ground doesn't work there

1004
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
But that's not what I

1005
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
I think is going on

1006
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
I think Alex is just almost

1007
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,623
Embarrassingly lazy and he doesn't give a s***

1008
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,535
It's much harder to deal with people as three-dimensional beings that are able to make decisions and hold complicated sometimes apparently contradict

1009
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Reposition

1010
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,095
On different issues that it is

1011
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,935
Just to make people heroes or villains depending on what they did or said that day

1012
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:25,567
On another level if you make people into sellouts and villains when they fail your bizarre purity test

1013
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,687
Kind of just the way that you don't have to end up looking in the mirror and judging your own beliefs

1014
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:36,575
Decide not to support the election conspiracies because he knows their b******* and he doesn't need Mike lindell's money

1015
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,623
He did it because he sold out to the global

1016
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
At least he did

1017
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,487
Intelli pool something that's already sold out of the globe was never opposed

1018
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,791
Then he must have wrestled back some kind of control

1019
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
Sure it's just

1020
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
That's nonsense

1021
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,935
It doesn't it that none of this means anything weird

1022
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,775
Weird lazy narrative

1023
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
Fiction

1024
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
Yeah it is a little bit like

1025
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
The

1026
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
Like

1027
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,919
Embodiment of Twitter

1028
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:08,319
You know like that like that idea of there's a main character on Twitter everyday and you can

1029
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,159
Matter it just doesn't matter and then the next day we everybody moves on

1030
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,719
You know it's it's just that kind of like

1031
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Today's

1032
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Topix

1033
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,815
Today's heroes and villains like it's

1034
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,631
He doesn't do a serialized show

1035
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,239
Yeah yeah there's there's

1036
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,823
Discontinuity all over the place

1037
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
What you can't do

1038
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
It's jarring

1039
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Any expects the audience

1040
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
To sort of live in

1041
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
That

1042
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,247
Space as there

1043
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,039
Conception of reality

1044
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
I mean that's awful good

1045
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
So I think that Alex Jones

1046
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
This is a liar and it is a fraud

1047
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,559
But I also think that he has some pretty dangerous perspectives

1048
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,839
Visa V religion

1049
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
And

1050
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,447
I think that his view of

1051
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,983
His

1052
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,567
Is there a Christian identity conception is a mess

1053
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
And

1054
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,711
I'm against it while he was famous you know he did quotes

1055
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
Jesus in Mark 21

1056
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,575
54 when Jesus said do what thou wilt

1057
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,623
If you recall that was a big one

1058
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,903
Haha

1059
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
So

1060
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
When

1061
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
People talk about

1062
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Brogan

1063
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,607
One of the things you would like the idea of platforming

1064
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,399
Platforming hours

1065
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,959
I think that there's one part of it that is like

1066
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:34,079
You're giving an uncritical interview to somebody who is disseminating bad information

1067
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,919
You're not capable of pushing back on him in the way that would

1068
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,711
Expose that this is bulshit

1069
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:45,087
And by doing that you are accidentally supporting or intentionally supporting

1070
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Everything

1071
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,647
But he is lying about right

1072
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,183
Now there's a secondary

1073
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Danger

1074
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,255
And part of it to the platforming

1075
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,559
That that

1076
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
Maybe is a little bit

1077
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Less obvious

1078
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:03,519
And that is that you just have people who get it doctrinated and exposed to Alex through it and this collar is one of the

1079
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
I just wanted to

1080
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
Say thank you

1081
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
First time I heard you was on the

1082
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,431
Joe Rogan podcast

1083
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Inherently

1084
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
As a

1085
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,855
Is waiting for someone

1086
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
2

1087
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Tap into that

1088
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
That God has for us

1089
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
And you definitely did that for me

1090
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,815
So I thank you for that

1091
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,631
Hey Brogan's essentially helping out with Colt

1092
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,655
Recruitment

1093
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
End

1094
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,287
You know I mean like another part of

1095
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
Unhappy with

1096
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
Is that

1097
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:44,223
You have to know that Alex is coming in to exploit

1098
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,039
Before you even wrote them on your cereal

1099
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:50,367
If your Rogan you have to know that he's coming in

1100
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,207
With an agenda that has nothing to do with you and is

1101
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,511
Pretty much insulting directly to your face

1102
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
You know like it's

1103
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,839
Ostensible your friend

1104
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,167
Like I can't believe that you don't have the self-respect

1105
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,191
Necessary to be like

1106
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
Hey f*** you

1107
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,591
And if you were to present information

1108
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
That was counter to the nonsense

1109
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,223
But Alex was trying to pass off on your show

1110
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:20,319
You didn't stoolie not be his friend anymore

1111
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
Yep yep

1112
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:26,719
Alex might be out for blood again that you wouldn't stand up for yourself

1113
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:30,303
That's what would have happened

1114
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,703
100 million dollar contractor

1115
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
Right now

1116
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,031
So Mike Lindell shows up and his

1117
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
Looking symposium

1118
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Everything Is Awesome

1119
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
That one little tiny thing

1120
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,479
Anything

1121
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,551
About to guess we've got with us for the next few segments

1122
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,343
My pillow

1123
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
Dot-com

1124
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,695
Big American dolls American employees

1125
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,511
Products here in America and sponsoring

1126
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,303
Integrity in elections

1127
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,863
Nationalism and patriotism

1128
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:09,215
Conference last week for 3 days

1129
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,031
Parking for Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

1130
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
In Sioux Falls South Dakota

1131
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,663
I watched it at all these scientists and engineers

1132
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,479
Logarithm showing the proof showing

1133
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:24,575
You're all this and then the media focused on one issue

1134
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,367
With one file he was given

1135
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
How they do it

1136
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Is underlying

1137
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Information

1138
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
Problem

1139
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,351
The foundation for your house right right

1140
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,631
What's on a

1141
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:44,031
Lake yeah but overall the route

1142
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:47,103
They're underwater really well construct

1143
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,431
Short know and I can see that if I go underwater

1144
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,967
Plumbing

1145
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,015
Installed very well

1146
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
In so much water

1147
00:56:55,551 --> 00:57:01,183
Salvation

1148
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
Problem

1149
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,303
Writes this is an interesting line Alex is trying to walk

1150
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
Unfortunately

1151
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,167
Mike Lindell does not want to play ball with this

1152
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,263
And I'd like to get into all the big discoveries that were made in proven

1153
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,151
That got overshadowed by the media distracting onto a few things at 100%

1154
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
Paisley manifest

1155
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,807
But I don't know what you're talkin about as far as

1156
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,855
They focused on a bad file

1157
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,719
They out there was no filed focused on is it icing but

1158
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,303
What's going on here

1159
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,703
Is the Alex is trying to save what he can from the wreckage of this conference understand that it's time to

1160
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,471
Abandon ship

1161
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:52,383
Community recognizes that it's time to pretend that the conference was actually total proved election fraud

1162
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,783
Damaging to the globalist that they had to focus on how the fake packet captures that Mike said the election was strolling came from

1163
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,831
Notorious fraud guy Dennis Montgomery

1164
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,695
Mike doesn't get the game and he seems to be refusing to accept that he was defrosted by Montgomery

1165
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,535
So this is this is a dicey start to this interview cuz they were there

1166
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,607
Working at cross-purposes Alex's trying to help him

1167
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
By attacking

1168
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,167
This one like

1169
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
This whole

1170
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
It might doesn't realize that

1171
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,847
Boats going down you want to you want to get out of here we can just get on the bed

1172
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
It's just the two of us

1173
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,967
So we can get on the lifeboats there's no women and children there's nothing

1174
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,271
We can just get on the Lifeboat

1175
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,159
MP5 will get you another boat ashore trip over to that other boat right there

1176
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,743
All of your supplies are on that other boat with moved

1177
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,839
You don't have no reason to stay on this bus

1178
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,143
The boat is very well-constructed

1179
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,239
Not giving up

1180
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,287
Triad my own team

1181
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
For five months

1182
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,359
Spend millions of dollars

1183
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,431
White hat hackers

1184
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,503
From all different all different.

1185
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,903
Walk the light I mean that they're not they didn't have diverse white hat hacker. My information and got all these terabytes from Porter

1186
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
By the way including

1187
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,303
Dennis Montgomery

1188
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
Validated

1189
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,167
Everybody data is data

1190
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:26,079
Episode of podcast for YouTube

1191
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:29,407
Alex

1192
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Mike just talked it out there

1193
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:37,343
Yeah but he he's he's still holding onto like it it's valid it's good

1194
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
Information

1195
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,159
Unreal oldies

1196
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
Scooby's hackers

1197
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,207
Is that he has work

1198
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:46,559
Confirm I wonder if one of them is a Nigerian prince

1199
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,399
Anybody spending millions of dollars on

1200
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,191
Getting another phone call

1201
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:58,079
The whole premise of Mike cyber Symposium was that he was going to bring these like Tech

1202
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Pinnacle Minds together and they were going to see this evidence and it was going to be irrefutable

1203
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,831
Gyros Supreme Court

1204
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,135
Mind-blowing

1205
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Now that didn't

1206
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:18,815
Sure Mike's got a different angle on it and that I didn't show you all the information

1207
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:25,215
I got to keep something back in case they try and kill him

1208
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:29,055
Billions of dollars

1209
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,871
And this is taking months for all these people to verify

1210
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,271
Write my how could they possibly even dis rarefy it in the

1211
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
Three days in Bossier

1212
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,599
Impossible

1213
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
That's so funny yeah

1214
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,487
When you see somebody who is really that delusional

1215
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,559
You're at your mind boggles you know you're like

1216
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:57,471
Can you survive this long like this are you a millionaire you're absolutely nuts

1217
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,567
Are you controlled by a robot everybody

1218
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
I have

1219
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:05,407
All the Cyber data from the 2020 election

1220
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
In my possession

1221
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
Okay

1222
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,783
I'm not going to go get

1223
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,367
Ogo validate this it took me

1224
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,415
I don't know if 66

1225
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,439
A people

1226
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719
Didn't know each other

1227
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,255
Validating data

1228
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,327
Invalidated it took them for 3 to 4 months

1229
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,655
Can I search for these guys there's no sense I already know it's real

1230
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,751
Over here for the Supreme Court when we need to get when we going to get there

1231
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
You're not going to get that

1232
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:36,639
That's kind of is a betrayal of the entire premise of his big event

1233
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
Yeah

1234
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:43,295
It was supposed to be like I'm going to show all this evidence is going to be irrefutable

1235
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:48,927
I'm not going to show you the evidence cuz I already know that it's real and there's no way

1236
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:53,023
The you would be able to even verify it in the amount of time that we have cuz 6

1237
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
The eight people took four months

1238
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,119
It does seem like what he said was

1239
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
Okay

1240
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,215
I said I was going to show you the Smoking Gun right I did

1241
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,031
Now unfortunately wasn't the gun that fired

1242
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
So I've kept that one

1243
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,383
This was like a model of the smoke

1244
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,175
Nose like a is like a

1245
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:14,783
Reproduction of Lifetime special

1246
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:20,159
Sir that's a smallmouth bass okay now I understand but have you seen it

1247
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
Sing

1248
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,047
Hello my baby hello my honey

1249
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,351
90

1250
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:35,007
Got a Looney Tunes frog on the Supreme Court Justices death

1251
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,799
Doing a little soft-shoe

1252
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
Advocates

1253
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
So in this next clip

1254
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,199
Mike Lindell talks about how he's on a

1255
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
Crusade

1256
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
To keep the media honest

1257
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:49,599
Sure and part of that apparently involves doxing reporters

1258
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:54,719
I put out a report and you don't have calling out all bad media I'm calling out bad

1259
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
Bti even games

1260
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,071
This guy that put out the report with associate press

1261
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,935
I gave his phone number on Alex

1262
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,263
Because I'm not going to take these guys doing this bad journalists anymore

1263
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
But one of the things that happen is

1264
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,407
Trunews I went out there and went out her True News.

1265
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
Find out there a great ministry

1266
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,319
I called up Rick Wiles

1267
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:26,719
And sure it we both find out we prayed together this morning, both setup

1268
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Oh my God

1269
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,583
They just really don't read the Bible

1270
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
I just don't

1271
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Just don't

1272
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:39,775
Rick Wiles introduced the guy who famously said that the

1273
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,591
The impeachment of trump with a coup

1274
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,735
I think that might just confess to a

1275
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:55,647
Yeah he did say he just released a journalist phone number

1276
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,951
Retaliation

1277
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,863
I mean according to his own internal sense of morality I think he was lying so I can release

1278
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
His phone number to the world

1279
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
And that's fine

1280
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,007
I don't I don't subscribe to that morality

1281
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,079
According to him

1282
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:18,431
There is nothing he can even say to me that it's a bad argument

1283
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,039
So Mike has a little bit of a plea that he needs to make as Alex's going out to

1284
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Guilty

1285
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,647
If you go to Crime. Frank's beach.com everybody

1286
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:32,767
Crime. Brightspace.com and you're out there and you've been you've been threatened

1287
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:37,887
Are you at the evidence back in November December of with updates machines or whatever of this cybertech

1288
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:41,983
Go there fill out the form we will get told you my direct team

1289
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,031
I will get your tree I will cover you

1290
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,895
I will cover you I will just like I got Tina is fighting hard

1291
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
No

1292
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,759
He's not file a lawsuit that makes him

1293
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:00,671
We should all my look back. I don't think that anybody should but I don't think it's a

1294
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,231
Impossible that that is not going to

1295
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,303
To be like in favor of you

1296
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,327
Like people just

1297
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,375
Putting fake email addresses in

1298
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,423
It's just a

1299
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
Moth to Flame.

1300
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,055
Speech.com I believe

1301
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,151
I think that this doesn't sound like the actions of somebody who has

1302
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:26,783
90 absolute evidence of election fraud already I don't know why you need to add

1303
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,879
Why would you gild the Lily by trying to solicit whistleblower

1304
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,463
I mean I think that's what you would do with all your evidence was s***

1305
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,023
And you needed to start from the ground up again

1306
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
It kind of is the smell that I'm getting for

1307
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:43,423
Not many prosecution's have like

1308
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,215
So we presented our case

1309
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,263
To the judge and the judge is declarative guilt

1310
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Now

1311
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:52,639
We need to get a lot of ideas about how to get him to declare this guy guilty

1312
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:56,223
That doesn't work we got the guilty charge

1313
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
We got this

1314
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,831
Now let's come at this from another angle about super guilty

1315
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,391
Have you thought about super duper guilty

1316
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,927
Go to the 19th

1317
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
Yes

1318
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,487
This day was Friday

1319
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,535
Haha Thursday

1320
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,863
Is disappointing Alex Ross

1321
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,911
Oh no cigarettes

1322
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,151
They must be misspeaking no

1323
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,967
I was actually read the UK government studies

1324
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
That

1325
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,807
Doctor's name was on

1326
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,647
Lab coat in lab

1327
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,463
Operation

1328
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
Abby

1329
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
You've all seen it

1330
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
You all heard it

1331
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,055
Literature

1332
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,103
You don't just think when

1333
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,431
I was sent that

1334
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,503
That's what I thought about it

1335
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,023
People are asking

1336
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,863
What is this what do you think so I said well let me go look

1337
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:22,751
In the world in the UK

1338
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
Undisputed

1339
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
Don't put that. Back on screen weekend

1340
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
And

1341
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,575
Pizzas

1342
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,439
6 times what it was almost

1343
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,279
Blood cell.

1344
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
That's nice that's the doctor

1345
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,143
Exposing white blood cell count slower

1346
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,191
Broadcast

1347
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:57,311
Santa Cruz fault I reach the level of being upset now

1348
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,871
Too much information

1349
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,431
This is a mess that's bad

1350
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
That's embarrassing

1351
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,015
Dr. Bauer is the right doctor

1352
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,319
This guy from The Francis Crick

1353
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Institute

1354
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,391
Has no idea what

1355
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,671
Narratives are which

1356
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
He seems

1357
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,999
Swae Lee

1358
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,327
A little bit I'm just going to rebroadcast he does

1359
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,119
Actually doesn't go to broadcast

1360
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
You take a little break

1361
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,543
E4me

1362
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,847
And then we're going

1363
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,127
To come back

1364
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
And I'm going to start the show over

1365
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,807
I'm going to start the show over at that point

1366
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,647
And David have all the information for you it's going to be beautiful

1367
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,183
Beautiful man

1368
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,207
This is like

1369
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:50,815
13 minutes into the show to like it never started over after a quarter of an hour

1370
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,983
I love how many people call in and I like Alex you're the leader we need you're a leader you're the one who's doing

1371
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:05,663
Like the idea of going over the hill with him Alex be like

1372
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,967
No you got didn't charge the right way

1373
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:13,087
F*** it I don't even want to do this war anymore I'm taking a little break e

1374
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Alright

1375
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,463
Another started shelling US1

1376
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,255
Sounds like a like

1377
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,815
A baby that's still drunk from the Night by

1378
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:26,399
Before with a lampshade on his head got to take a little break

1379
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,423
Got to take a little break

1380
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,983
I got to get some fluids

1381
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
Overly

1382
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
Sigillo Breaky break

1383
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:38,943
Yeah that's what the rest of the episode does end up getting a little bit morose little bit of a bummer

1384
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:46,111
It's overwhelming it's mind-blowing that they actually did this

1385
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,975
Exploding they have hit us so hard

1386
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
By this winter

1387
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,839
You probably need to stay home

1388
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,191
Annabelle Stacy we told you when everyone's reminded on

1389
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Five-year-olds

1390
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,871
Sexual pedophiles

1391
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,919
They just created by 11

1392
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,015
You'll take the vaccine you become the bioweapon factory

1393
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,599
People are fighting about here's Matt Baker of San Diego

1394
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:23,999
So Alex is really into this guy Matt Baker at in San Diego

1395
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:27,327
Cancel Coronavirus

1396
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,143
Alex is really into this dude

1397
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
No possible way

1398
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,471
Alex YouTube Eli

1399
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,031
Well we f***** up with this auntie mask thing

1400
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,359
I was a bad move on our part

1401
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,895
We just blew it

1402
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
We just blew it

1403
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:45,247
We were you know we got it right

1404
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
At the beginning

1405
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,319
And then we tried to own the lip

1406
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
Into our own.

1407
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,391
So that was a bad move

1408
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:57,279
Could I could have made some different decisions it's some other points but now

1409
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
The globalist have killed us all

1410
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:05,727
Now let's watch a guy yell at a city council meeting much like everyone to know that we take no responsibility

1411
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,031
Ability for our own actions whatsoever

1412
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:12,895
Nope nothing we have ever done is that not this next clip is a really great

1413
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:16,223
Encapsulation of Alex Jones's journalistic Style

1414
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,807
He's going to play a video of someone

1415
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,879
Crying and saying that their child had died

1416
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,903
After getting the facts

1417
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Sure

1418
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
However

1419
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,679
12 year old 50 year old 18 year old

1420
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,471
Taking visor shot

1421
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:46,431
I can't verify this video that I'm about to play for you that is incredibly emotionally charged

1422
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,479
I can't verify that this is real

1423
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
I don't know

1424
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,319
It seems to be saying the things that I want to say

1425
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,135
So it's feels real to me

1426
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,951
Here's the hairdo that here's the clip

1427
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,999
Of the president of the United States

1428
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,535
Pushing a terrorist

1429
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
Out of his

1430
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
Here we go

1431
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,143
And it's Harrison Ford

1432
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,447
It feels real

1433
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,543
Feels real I've seen a lot of real clips of President it seems like

1434
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:18,943
How a president would respond to a terrorist being an airplane what else you going to say like get on my plane

1435
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,991
Absolutely.

1436
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
Yikes

1437
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,087
I think you just need to do better than that

1438
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:29,183
I I don't I don't think that when you have a large platform like this

1439
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,719
That

1440
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,815
Stopping to the fact that you have no idea that you're playing is real

1441
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
I think you shouldn't play it then

1442
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,959
I can't tell you how many times I've heard of a journalist

1443
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,983
Who is spent

1444
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
Weeks

1445
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,103
Days just non non-stop time trying to

1446
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
Run-down asaurus

1447
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:52,735
Trying to run down and verify a fact because it's so good

1448
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,575
It's so good that it needs to be in there and people need to know

1449
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,159
And in order to run it you have to be able to confirm its veracity

1450
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,183
And then they couldn't

1451
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,975
Run it

1452
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,071
If you can't confirm it you can just not

1453
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,607
You're not you're not you should

1454
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
Fuchsia

1455
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
But Alex doesn't

1456
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,727
Care all about

1457
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Just

1458
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
Whatever

1459
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
Who gives a s***

1460
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,895
All these African presidents were tortured that I have bills on sale

1461
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,175
So

1462
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,223
Alex has been expecting a false flag

1463
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,503
As We Know

1464
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
And so there was that guy with the car

1465
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,623
They said he had a bomb

1466
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
Right.

1467
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,743
Expect

1468
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,303
They've been staying online that by the

1469
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,607
15 to the 20th

1470
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,423
Trump would be reinstated

1471
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
A dyad

1472
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,311
Screenplays

1473
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,615
A man in a big black truck pulls up

1474
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,175
On the edge of the Capitol sidewalk

1475
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:59,295
And then just starts yelling and screaming and expecting that he's there for the insurrection

1476
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,623
Just like we got a million people out there on January 6th

1477
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,671
Eclipse

1478
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Ellipse

1479
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,023
And then I'm just outside with Mark the capital peacefully

1480
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:14,143
A few

1481
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,423
600 go in

1482
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,983
We're all terrorists were all criminals ever that

1483
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,055
All the other people believe

1484
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,367
And so now there is a man in a standoff

1485
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
On the capitol grounds

1486
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,463
Watch the video mocking are at all

1487
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,023
Supposed to fold cam

1488
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
Turn off on doing I hope you have a good shot

1489
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,119
Add

1490
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,703
Tampa Police that he basically threatening them and now he's saying he's not

1491
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,799
We're just going to watch this as it unfolds are so the headline

1492
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:57,151
Capitol lockdown policing ocean with man in pickup truck claim to have explosive

1493
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
Device

1494
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:02,783
I'm just here for the overthrow I mean

1495
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,599
We got sucked in by the cute art stuff

1496
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,999
Communicating with police

1497
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,303
Using a whiteboard

1498
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
Hear what he has to say

1499
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,959
This is the derangement of the key brainwashing

1500
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,663
How can people think it's a joke

1501
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
They cleared the block

1502
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
I'm calling nine-one-one three times

1503
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
Who's my wife

1504
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,799
I'm not entirely positive one

1505
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:01,407
Journalistic value there is to Alex playing long stretches of this guy's

1506
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
Video

1507
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,015
2

1508
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:11,391
I think that there was a hope that I like it's like

1509
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,719
Maybe playing it with some of differentiate this guy from

1510
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,511
What Alex believes

1511
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,535
No

1512
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,583
Sounds very much

1513
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:25,727
Yeah and I don't know what I don't this is not a good false flag for Alex

1514
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,775
I don't think obviously it didn't

1515
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,567
End up in explosion

1516
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
Which is good

1517
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
Sure

1518
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,663
Absolutely better than the alternative

1519
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,015
I don't think that it has the

1520
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,319
Needs for

1521
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
The false flag that said he wanted to profit off

1522
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,951
There's no real spectacles of Isuzu

1523
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,231
Is it going to guy got arrested

1524
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,559
Hudson bomb threat

1525
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,191
It's kind of Alex's Hearts not even really in it that much

1526
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
This isn't that kind of assault

1527
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,287
He needs to take a nap

1528
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
It's take a longer break

1529
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:06,687
And so we're going to take a break he can go to the 20th

1530
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
Cuz

1531
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,247
Alright alright

1532
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:12,063
Intolerant

1533
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:18,463
So the 20th is Friday and this is the day that we talked about Owen Shroyer show already where he's announcing that he

1534
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,743
Use

1535
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,119
I didn't do my community service

1536
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:30,751
Is all my fault personally I made all of these choices and then I am now paying for

1537
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,031
You know if somebody

1538
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,311
Near me

1539
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:39,967
Could explain cause and effect well enough perhaps I would have realized that my car

1540
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,063
Effects when should have been listening to Alex's show along

1541
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:49,183
Causality is his main focus

1542
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,487
Owen could learn a little bit about object permanence

1543
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Stupid

1544
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,791
Like whenever this

1545
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:57,631
This deferred-prosecution agreement isn't in front of you it's still exist

1546
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,679
Still there

1547
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,983
So anyway Alex is in a bad mood

1548
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,519
On the 20th

1549
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:10,175
America

1550
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:15,295
And the birth of the new second Dark Age under the cyclotron

1551
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,575
Technocracy

1552
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:23,487
Is all the leftist and all the scum are going to be judged only the first

1553
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,303
The Dalai Lama

1554
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Cool

1555
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:32,959
But everybody that didn't like America then like Freedom it didn't like Jesus

1556
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,311
Self-defense you're about to get

1557
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,615
Front row seats to your own destruction

1558
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,735
This is the very Twilight

1559
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,807
Final minutes

1560
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,855
The final

1561
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,879
Second

1562
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,671
The death of the Republic

1563
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:01,887
Hollywood and its accounting minions are going to take their time without

1564
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,007
Slowly bring the country down and splicing into little chunks

1565
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,335
We're going to go into bondage just like

1566
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,615
Like those little babies

1567
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,967
Never got to talk about their mothers breasts never got to learn their first word

1568
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,087
They just got their brain

1569
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,207
The operating table at nine months old and they were lucky

1570
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:30,559
What popular not taking delivered alive till University facility where

1571
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,399
Battle shafted unbelievable things to them

1572
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,983
They were just ordering line fetuses for liposuction

1573
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,799
We're just trying their hearts and livers on

1574
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,847
You know they were doing more don't you

1575
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,199
What national Canadian television Centre they just got in with her

1576
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,783
Satanic ritual on TV it's all about letting you know

1577
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,135
Time

1578
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,695
Ladies and gentlemen

1579
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,999
Yeah that that really upset me

1580
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
What are they saying

1581
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,143
I guess maybe Satanic rituals

1582
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
I guess it's probably would

1583
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,215
The doctors are doing such an approachable.

1584
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:15,104
In Australia there was a newscast era day

1585
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
Peace

1586
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,456
Of a Satanic ritual accidentally

1587
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,528
But it was just like at the Satanic ritual is people in robes

1588
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,856
Just waiting on a stage going like

1589
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,440
But like so scary

1590
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,256
The ritual sacrifice

1591
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,304
Guess

1592
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,352
What happened

1593
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,912
By somebody who worked at the station

1594
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:45,312
Or it's entirely possible to that someone was working on a story about the the satanic

1595
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,872
Example that a clipping light because they

1596
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
The satanic temple in question

1597
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:52,480
Has been making a lot of

1598
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,272
You know he's about

1599
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,808
Them not being allowed

1600
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,880
To teach Satanism in schools

1601
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,928
Is basically just trying to

1602
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,976
Confront the idea that you are allowed to teach

1603
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,280
Other religious stuff in schools

1604
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,120
And in so I could see somebody at that station

1605
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:13,472
Working on a story this is some b-roll from that accidentally got into a

1606
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,240
Story

1607
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
Because it's

1608
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,800
Like basically local news

1609
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
Is it could happen

1610
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,360
I could see it I could

1611
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,152
See it happening quite easily

1612
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,456
There's an accident

1613
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,992
Aspect of this

1614
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
It certainly not proof that

1615
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,320
They're trying to normalize and

1616
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,136
Throwed demonic rituals in your face

1617
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,672
You know it is kind of funny

1618
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
Tumi

1619
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
That

1620
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,768
In order for these types of

1621
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,608
Quote unquote Christians to like

1622
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,400
Maintain their belief in God

1623
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,448
They also have to give

1624
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,984
Satan worshipers

1625
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,288
A powerful religion

1626
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,312
You know what I'm saying like

1627
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,128
Both in order for them to justify themselves

1628
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,688
They have to be afraid of something

1629
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
That

1630
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,016
Is just a bunch of people's cone

1631
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:01,344
Like you've created a fear out of

1632
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:07,744
Nothing and a lot of the people who are doing these things like I want to teach Satanism in school

1633
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,144
Are doing it not in order to teach Satanism in school but doing it in order to make it so you can't teach your

1634
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,424
Religious beliefs

1635
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,728
Do people in schools

1636
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,288
Satan is just a your belief system

1637
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,592
It you're looking at Satan and Satan's like

1638
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,152
You're a hypocrite you idiot and you're like

1639
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
Pure Evil

1640
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,504
Right

1641
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
It's

1642
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,320
Just

1643
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,856
I grow weary of it

1644
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:37,952
I think it's a probably there's a lot of incidents of this like local news

1645
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:42,048
Things they've just have the wrong b-roll but a lot of them are probably so

1646
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
Boring

1647
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,376
You never hear about it

1648
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,728
Child riding a tricycle

1649
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,032
It's Ono I was doing the story about

1650
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,848
Please and there's a beer all of a kid riding a tricycle

1651
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,504
That's never going to you never going to hear about that

1652
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
Because

1653
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,368
Dum Dums

1654
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,648
So the Taliban

1655
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,928
They have

1656
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,464
Made some moves

1657
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Afghanistan

1658
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,048
He's not talking about this

1659
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
To too much

1660
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,352
Sprite

1661
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,632
Look

1662
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,984
You know who get who get this he's only complimented the Taliban

1663
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,288
You know who did it though

1664
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,336
Who it was a Taliban

1665
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,384
With it they had help

1666
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408
Satan

1667
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,688
Obama

1668
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
And somebody else

1669
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:38,112
Ladies and gentlemen pay 100% of the Taliban to take over that way

1670
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,160
100% Fat Joe Biden

1671
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,720
This is

1672
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
Obama

1673
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,048
This is Kamala Harris

1674
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:50,912
And it's just our plan doesn't mean by none get in trouble doesn't mean he's not terrible

1675
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,984
My point is we need to put the blame on

1676
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,288
The bureaucracy that Puttin me on

1677
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:00,128
And the media that said he can be a president and then help him steal the election

1678
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,664
However Obama and

1679
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,944
Kamala Harris having

1680
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,480
I was thinking

1681
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:09,856
That thing but they are both foreign policy expert

1682
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,696
They not white is that

1683
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,488
To not white people who have

1684
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,304
Copperview executive

1685
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,400
Person that he's a patsy he's not a******

1686
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,192
I mean that's amazing

1687
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:30,848
That is just an amazing amount of unexamined racism wow even your number one villain you're like

1688
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,408
Well he's a white man let's not go crazy okay

1689
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,992
Sure he worships Satan but this one this is not a white man

1690
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:42,112
He's a doddering fool you being used by the

1691
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
Yep

1692
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Unreal

1693
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,952
What a massive

1694
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,256
Sucks

1695
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,024
So

1696
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,328
Alex has gotten that headline

1697
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,352
I bet he wants to cover

1698
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,144
And this has to do with

1699
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,680
The FBI putting out

1700
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,216
Statements

1701
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,032
That statement but some sources with the

1702
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
Klein Forest

1703
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:02,592
Manaphy I saying that

1704
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:07,200
Rodger Stone and Alex Jones didn't have some elaborate plan on the 6th

1705
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,248
Break

1706
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,320
Figured out exactly how he wanted to cover

1707
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,880
Emily forgot

1708
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,464
You know it's hard to tell him Willie Nelson story and I get into something like this

1709
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,536
Because this just really really a big deal

1710
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,376
And I don't want to say things about this that are wrong

1711
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,240
I want two times when I get ready to say something on here

1712
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:33,056
During the break at all crystallized

1713
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,616
And I have the perfect explanation

1714
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,176
English Spanish

1715
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,272
Battling spin like a politics but then like him

1716
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
Cool

1717
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
Billiards

1718
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,952
Information

1719
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:56,864
Give three more examples really clear and people get the nuance.

1720
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:03,776
Take a phone call and forget what I was going to say that I said hey I'll cover you next Eggman

1721
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,080
What I am is Fatima do now

1722
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:09,664
I like the I like the music I figured I would like is really

1723
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Concise

1724
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:14,016
Perfect nuanced way to say this thing and then I forgot

1725
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,832
I'll talk about it next time

1726
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:21,952
I'll get to it I had this really important

1727
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:27,328
I'm saying that I made sure that I understood clearly and could communicate effectively

1728
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:32,192
But then I took a phone call and because I have the memory of what people think of goldfish

1729
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,496
I completely forgot what I was

1730
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,800
That being said

1731
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,104
The right after that clip

1732
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
Alex has

1733
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,664
What I would call one of the more

1734
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,944
Poetic description

1735
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
Of what it's like to feel

1736
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,272
Forget something

1737
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,600
So the one thing that he is an expert at

1738
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,160
I mean this is pretty good

1739
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Alright

1740
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,328
Take a phone call and forget what I was going to say and then I say hey I'll cover the next segment

1741
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,120
Which is what I'm going to do now

1742
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,728
But just as soon as I try

1743
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,664
Grass that fire again flickers away from me this

1744
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:23,904
I tell you I'm really surprised that the establishment I mean it's one thing to plan this new world order

1745
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,488
Play in the end of America to bring the planet bioweapon release

1746
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,792
It's one thing to plan injecting people with

1747
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,864
Program until they die

1748
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,912
And express treatments

1749
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,240
Another enchilada baby

1750
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:44,128
I'll give it to fauci man what are we doing

1751
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,920
Bad motherfukers

1752
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,528
Bad hombre

1753
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,856
Nothing on you

1754
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,928
You vampire bat

1755
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Creature

1756
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
But you know what

1757
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:05,632
Schwab and Bill Gates dish out

1758
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,168
Versace

1759
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,520
This is honest where that we deserve the weekend that's what happens when you

1760
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:15,616
Serta forget what you were going to talk about you end up giving it up to fauci and

1761
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,176
Plus Rob lesson you guys

1762
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,712
You're evil

1763
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:24,576
Top notch

1764
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:30,208
Likes Final Fantasy man you are good evil

1765
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:33,280
So we've got the Somali pirates

1766
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
The Taliban

1767
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
And the global

1768
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,352
Now they have to give it up

1769
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
Yeah yeah

1770
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,680
Cool it seems like the only person you don't have to

1771
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
It is

1772
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,640
A badass motherfuker

1773
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,224
I'm so Alex finally get back to his train of thought

1774
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,808
Flickering flame but he was trying to grab

1775
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
Yes like

1776
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,880
Prometheus getting his

1777
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,672
Throat checked out every morning

1778
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
Grabbing

1779
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,816
Get the hold of it

1780
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
This

1781
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,120
Is nuts

1782
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,216
Alex's found out that the FBI made the state

1783
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,240
But that like

1784
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
Rodger Stone

1785
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
Again

1786
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,312
I keep saying it's a state

1787
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,336
It's not

1788
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
There's just a

1789
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,384
An article in Reuters

1790
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,968
They have some sources in law enforcement

1791
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,016
They say that there is scant evidence

1792
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
But there was

1793
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,320
Overarching

1794
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,368
Planning

1795
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,648
Behind the January

1796
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,696
Which is not news

1797
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:40,096
Well I mean if you go by Occam's razor all of their other plans have been poorly put together

1798
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,936
Almost non-existent and have been ineffective and kind of

1799
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:48,288
Resistance is the model

1800
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:52,128
DD right-wing in the extreme-right organized

1801
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,432
As for decades

1802
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,736
And so there would never be

1803
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,760
Elaborate

1804
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:00,320
Organization

1805
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,600
No it's not the mafia

1806
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,136
That's about how

1807
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,416
The folks

1808
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,440
Community

1809
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,096
Alex takes this information

1810
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,656
In a way that I could not have

1811
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,936
Possibly imagine

1812
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
It's

1813
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:17,984
Wild

1814
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,824
I'm going to cover it

1815
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,200
I would have left the story today

1816
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,736
E5 a.m.

1817
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,600
Wedding brother punch in the stomach

1818
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,280
Ninety-nine percent of the time it's some horrible

1819
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,816
Fishes playing

1820
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,096
Okay we already got to stop

1821
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,400
So Alex wakes up at 5 in the morning

1822
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,424
Google's himself

1823
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,240
Yeah

1824
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:55,360
Is 8 hours of research is just putting his name in Google news and then hitting refresh

1825
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,712
I sat there

1826
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
Toilet at 5:30 a.m.

1827
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,624
Stomach

1828
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,672
And there was the

1829
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,608
I was thinking about what does that mean

1830
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,984
I think I know what that means

1831
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,056
It's actually a positive thing

1832
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,384
Not for me. I don't need myself

1833
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,736
Sign my life over a long time ago

1834
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,272
God

1835
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,368
Traditionally you make a deal with the other

1836
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:43,232
Forgot to save me a lot of the right things to the glove with cancer my family

1837
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,024
They can't do it again me to sell out

1838
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,328
Campursari

1839
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,632
I'm not worried about myself

1840
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,912
But

1841
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:55,776
I really wanted to sink and Noah dismiss I caught a lot of people are respect

1842
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,104
Different ideas to different views on it but

1843
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
I know what it is

1844
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,480
MPI being smart

1845
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
A lot.

1846
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:13,440
And I and II establishment that America the small vestigial group

1847
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,488
There's a question of life

1848
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,560
Is is the New World Order really a suicide pact

1849
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,632
I mean it screwed

1850
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,192
Your power and taking over really

1851
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:27,008
Really going to be good if you're destroying the process

1852
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,592
The answer is no so that's why they're not just about all

1853
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:40,576
So he's teasing isn't talk a little bit more about it but the essential thing is that he's

1854
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,136
He's interpreting this headline

1855
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:48,256
Is being the FBI deciding they don't want to go along with the globalists death called

1856
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Anymore

1857
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
Of course

1858
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,608
This is a sign that the global FBI

1859
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,656
There's dirt parts of it that are cool

1860
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,704
Because and I think

1861
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,288
Part of the reason I think he went that direction

1862
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,568
Is because

1863
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,616
It preserves him

1864
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,408
Being smart enough

1865
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,944
To have apple

1866
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
With Rodger

1867
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,992
Cursed out

1868
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,016
Whereas

1869
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:10,784
Because

1870
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,576
If that's the case then he's

1871
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:15,904
Still the leader of the resistance in the tip of the spear and all this stuff

1872
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,440
And the FBI is helping

1873
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,208
Cover for

1874
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,840
I think the reason that he's doing this is

1875
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,376
Because his name is in the story

1876
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
And

1877
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
It's fun

1878
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,704
Yeah yeah

1879
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,264
Although this is another

1880
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:36,128
This is another drop in the bucket of my belief that he is actually himself a Satan

1881
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:42,016
We keep going back and buy all the noises that he says Satan has make here's to the one that make them

1882
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:46,112
You'll steal the deal you can't make a deal with God that's the point

1883
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:51,488
Yeah God didn't go down to Georgia sell your soul to God

1884
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,280
Fields it already

1885
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
Yeah

1886
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,608
Took the essential thing here is that Alex thinks

1887
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,168
This FBI announcement

1888
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,704
This headline

1889
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,984
Events Stark

1890
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,008
Contradiction

1891
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,568
The Department of Homeland Security's strategic

1892
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
Document

1893
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:11,456
What's the smartest Minds out there people I respect

1894
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,856
Versus the national security policy of the president

1895
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,792
Even exist

1896
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
Now doesn't

1897
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:31,168
5 million Islamic refugees from Europe in the US right now

1898
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,848
No they said opposition to cover measures question the election

1899
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,128
That's the main Terrace

1900
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
MPI

1901
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,064
Verses that

1902
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,440
We're giving a final report to Congress I've already seen Italy Publix to

1903
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,816
Weatherscan

1904
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
Evidence

1905
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
0 Island

1906
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,728
A shadow of evidence

1907
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:13,920
That anybody plan an attack from capital

1908
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:18,272
Even if everything ilex was saying about

1909
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,576
All of the underlying documents in

1910
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:23,136
Underlying sources of

1911
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,672
It still wouldn't

1912
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,464
Be accurate to say that

1913
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,864
The what the FBI's announcement or this Reuters article at reversed or contradicted the dhs's 42

1914
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:37,728
Only cares about this cuz like I said the fact that his name is used in the article

1915
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,056
An unnamed former law enforcement official said quote

1916
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,872
Ninety-two 95% of these are one-off cases

1917
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:48,480
Plenty of 5% maybe of these militia groups that were more closely organized

1918
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:53,856
But there was no grand scheme with Rodger Stone and Alex Jones and all these people to storm the capital and take off

1919
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,976
Unified percent of the cases here

1920
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,792
That's not no one planning

1921
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:08,448
The article even points out that approximately 570 people have been charged total and 40 of them have been charged with

1922
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,056
That's about 7% of the arrested who prosecutors feel have

1923
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:16,896
They've enough evidence to charge with conspiracy

1924
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:21,760
I'm not sure the stories about Michelle and anyway the actual information that's in the story

1925
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,784
Or about what

1926
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,552
People have

1927
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
Ben

1928
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
News

1929
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,880
Acting rationally

1930
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:33,280
Alex is shocked by how accurate this the FBI sources are

1931
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,816
And of course when he

1932
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,864
Says that he then has to embellish

1933
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,656
Everything that they say

1934
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:54,784
About 5%

1935
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:59,136
That they did think they were going in the capital to take over

1936
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,488
Alex is just

1937
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,768
Writing that story

1938
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,792
For himself

1939
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,328
So this is

1940
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
Astoria

1941
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,680
Is Reuters story it's bitter

1942
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:15,776
Then the FBI just covering their own ass cuz that's what some people think

1943
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,568
Right some people think

1944
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,408
That the FBI is covering their eyes cuz they don't want investigations

1945
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,688
Into these militia

1946
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,016
Two groups because they do they'll find out that they're all run by the feds

1947
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,064
Brightree want to limit that

1948
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,600
But it's not just that

1949
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,624
According to

1950
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,928
I think it's bigger

1951
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208
And just

1952
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:41,120
I want an investigation of the provocateur groups

1953
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,192
Now it's about this

1954
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:48,032
It's about the national strategy for counter-terrorism

1955
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:52,384
Listing gun owners and veterans

1956
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
And

1957
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,480
People that question elections are lockdowns

1958
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,272
As terrorists

1959
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:02,368
What's interesting is that Alex is combining his miac report and

1960
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,440
Strategic document

1961
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,488
The gun owners in veterans

1962
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:10,048
That's a holdover from 2009

1963
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
It's

1964
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
It's interesting

1965
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,120
The way his brain works

1966
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,656
Spend as much as it's not

1967
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
Nothing at all

1968
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:21,312
A war in the FBI had any self-preservation any common sense

1969
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,896
MPI would not be led

1970
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,248
War with the American Linden

1971
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,880
Can you imagine the left

1972
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:38,720
Is it going to fight this war FBI agents

1973
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
A1

1974
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:43,840
Federal Marshals A180 fa1

1975
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,376
Bureaucrat

1976
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,192
Craft one

1977
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,472
Soldiers

1978
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:50,752
Men

1979
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,056
To go out and fight

1980
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,592
Other men

1981
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,384
A Dalmatian and

1982
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:00,480
Simple party is if you're not under mind control

1983
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:04,320
I don't want to fight with the FBI or the US Military

1984
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,368
Wouldn't help America anyways

1985
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:10,720
American I'd rather reach out to wake them up and they're like

1986
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:21,984
Maybe we should start saying no

1987
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
And that is what this this

1988
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,104
So yeah this is the way Alex is interpreting this

1989
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,688
Trivial news story

1990
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:34,016
It's a sign that the FBI

1991
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:40,928
Dad doesn't want to fight on behalf of the left against gun owners and Veterans and Patriots

1992
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:45,024
Wow you know the reason that

1993
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,816
The FBI

1994
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
And the bureaucrat

1995
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
That's in the likes

1996
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,632
Should handle this

1997
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,168
Because this is not a war

1998
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,192
No

1999
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:57,312
You are just your guys aren't ideologically aligned to save the country

2000
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,104
You're just a bunch of idiots women

2001
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,896
Just like everybody thought

2002
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,200
Give me a potential Criminal

2003
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,992
Well the ones who've already committed crimes

2004
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,016
Criminals

2005
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
The ones

2006
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,064
Who are idiots

2007
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,344
They're on their way

2008
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,136
There's something there on the street

2009
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,160
Anyway

2010
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,720
Alex gets off this topic

2011
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,512
After.

2012
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,560
Bizarrely interpreter

2013
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,352
Because the other guy

2014
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,888
Okay now this guess

2015
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:22,912
Someone is very

2016
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,448
Somebody else

2017
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:28,800
Okay this is a real get of you know this guy

2018
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,568
Alright

2019
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,592
From

2020
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:36,224
Going viral for yelling at a San Diego

2021
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,272
Back at it like a crack addict

2022
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:41,600
Alex finally got ahold of the guy who yelled at

2023
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:44,416
The San Diego board and went viral

2024
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,000
Matthew Baker I believe is named

2025
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:50,560
You've been on Owen Shroyer show multiple times

2026
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:54,912
Somebody said my God just got sounds like Alex Jones 2.0

2027
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,240
And turned out I didn't know his brother Warren twice

2028
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
I know you look familiar

2029
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,176
See if somebody was on Ellen Show multiple times

2030
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:10,272
Aspiring the right-wing sugar in there

2031
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:13,600
Anyway he's just somebody who

2032
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Alex

2033
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,184
He's a big fan of Alex's

2034
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,512
He's just repeating the things that Alex taught him

2035
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
How to pair it

2036
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,072
At this board meeting

2037
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:27,168
Video goes viral man Alex interviews him about what was it like

2038
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,728
To yell the things I taught you more less

2039
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,752
Stupid

2040
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,544
Ouroboros interview

2041
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,080
Happy here with Matt

2042
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:39,968
Well it's fantastic to be on the show Alex and you know I am a massive

2043
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:45,088
Fan and what people don't realize is I might not always be screaming and yelling but

2044
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,624
When I do with fur

2045
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:51,232
Humanity

2046
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Who

2047
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,616
Very much

2048
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,896
Fringe

2049
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,176
This is why you guys aren't

2050
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,968
Going to fight a war

2051
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,320
Because what you got right there

2052
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,184
Yep

2053
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:25,024
Yeah but I have to introduce yourself to somebody for like the third or fourth time

2054
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,120
You had that had a friendship before that started

2055
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,912
I swear to God because

2056
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,936
Both of us

2057
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,984
Thought we were doing that at the

2058
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:39,104
The same time both of us I don't think we'd ever met before but because we were comics

2059
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,128
And because weird

2060
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,688
Kind of generally seeing each other around you

2061
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,760
We just kind of started talking and both of us were soaking

2062
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:49,088
Confused and weren't sure if we had already met the other person

2063
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,392
That we just became friends for a couple years

2064
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:53,440
Like it wasn't even like we just

2065
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:56,768
In the friendship was entirely based around not wanting to be like

2066
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:03,168
Hey how you doing I'm Jordan and then have them be like yeah we met the last time that was the only thing the

2067
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,192
It started our friendship

2068
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:08,800
Just assuming that we already met before similarly one time

2069
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,592
I became friends with a comic book

2070
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:16,992
Because we just went up to each other and let

2071
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:19,552
That's not as far away

2072
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,160
So I deserve this clip of

2073
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,696
This guy who

2074
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,792
Basically just indoctrinated by Alex Jones and then now is

2075
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,072
A drone

2076
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,632
Drone with John out

2077
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,216
Go to these meetings you'll meet real hatred

2078
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:42,080
Right-wingers people Asian people

2079
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,360
Girl shoes

2080
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:47,200
I was always talking about you know I have a saying it's called

2081
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,856
I married

2082
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:57,440
I can't go to Patriot eventone River clothes off and people even know this

2083
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:06,144
While somebody just stand there like why are we living in a world full of pus

2084
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,168
This is this is

2085
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
Great while

2086
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,472
Wild

2087
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
Gold coin

2088
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:16,896
Angela Patriot rally and get your dick sucked come on ladies and gentlemen if you want

2089
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:23,296
Fight For Freedom you're going to get that dick so this is just like PCU

2090
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:32,000
Anyway I don't care about this guy just basically like

2091
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:36,864
You are being interviewed about how you believe Infowars

2092
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:42,496
Stuff on Infowars

2093
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:46,336
Or some s*** like that it's like of course you believe the same s***

2094
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,408
It's a it's a pointless exercise

2095
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
But

2096
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:54,528
He has another guest at the guy named dr. Vladimir zelensky

2097
01:44:54,784 --> 01:45:00,928
He's got his big into hydroxychloroquine and I would have you any eclipse

2098
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Because

2099
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:05,024
I don't really care and she also talks about how

2100
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,120
Now there's a war spiritual battle and

2101
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:12,192
How do I think it takes away some of your scientific credibility of your

2102
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
Talking about how the devil is

2103
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,032
Upon us

2104
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:16,800
See a doctor in

2105
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,848
I'm not sure I see there's a problem

2106
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,152
But we have to end this

2107
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,688
Episode on a high note

2108
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,528
Of course

2109
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:31,648
No we don't know I don't know what's happened with her when I was recording

2110
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,440
But there's only one

2111
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,976
Hinode that I can

2112
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:35,744
You can think of

2113
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,280
That will satisfy us

2114
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,840
Mike down for this

2115
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:46,496
If you can

2116
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:52,896
Oh I can taste it I certainly

2117
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:18,496
Because the whole galaxy just a city

2118
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:24,896
I'm going to get off this planet together gospel and you belong in the City Yuba

2119
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:31,296
Belong

2120
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:37,696
Are deducted the failed they already sign.

2121
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,256
The wrong energy

2122
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,816
I know they're cut off that's why they're so angry

2123
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:46,656
What do you think about it Galaxy is just a city

2124
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,848
I want

2125
01:46:55,104 --> 01:47:00,480
God damn it it's good it's true and you know what the only thing that unites all humans

2126
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:06,368
All Humans regardless of race Creed background ideology religion

2127
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,464
Dope sack that's what you mean you just need a good sax solo

2128
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,488
That's all you need

2129
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,256
Man

2130
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:18,656
Man oh man that trouble sex I thought you were going to say that the one thing that unites everybody is loving

2131
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:24,544
Alex Jones rambling / You Belong To The City definitely

2132
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,080
Connect sleep stream

2133
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:31,968
I hate Alex Jones was even I couldn't enjoy that and now it's clearly loved it

2134
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:37,088
But I bet there's a bunch of people in the middle who wouldn't find it as interesting as I do or as fun

2135
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:40,160
Dammit that was a good one though

2136
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:40,928
Concern

2137
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:47,072
How I can taste it

2138
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:50,912
I don't know if I could listen to that song like casually

2139
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,680
Without

2140
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:53,216
Filling in my own Alex

2141
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:58,592
Bulshit heard it at the store the grocery store like a couple months back and I

2142
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,688
Pretty excited

2143
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,480
Feel it

2144
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,016
There's nothing

2145
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,552
Better than I do I

2146
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,320
Giselle

2147
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:10,880
But there is nothing better than that

2148
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,672
The Galaxy is just a city

2149
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
That's

2150
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,000
Crocheting

2151
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,424
What what else did we get him

2152
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:29,824
Compare things to just played any song cars with the Galaxy

2153
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,152
She's a lot like a car my car

2154
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:40,320
You can whip you know in a lot of the ways we have to

2155
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,344
Whip it good

2156
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:46,208
Mufon I can whip it

2157
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:51,072
Yats

2158
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,400
Just think that I wanted to stress on this episode

2159
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,680
Is really that

2160
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,216
Owens

2161
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,240
Charge

2162
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:01,312
I have no faith that he's actually going to see the inside of

2163
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,336
The jail cell

2164
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,152
It seems like it seems unlikely

2165
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:08,224
And the reality behind it

2166
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,248
Is this

2167
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,808
The Deferred prosecution

2168
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,880
Alex has a not in any

2169
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,160
Real trouble

2170
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,440
Of any sort

2171
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,768

Bfbi deciding that they don't want to fight with the globalist

2185
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:50,976
