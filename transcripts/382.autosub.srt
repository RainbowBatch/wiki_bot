1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
Everybody likes it around

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,072
A little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,912
Jordan Jordan Red Mountain

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,056
Of material for the show over the past anything in 2019 that you would enjoy

8
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Moving on

9
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
No

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Have Nots

11
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
It started out the year with an intention of having for recreational reading

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Read as much Philip a dick

13
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,488
As I was going to try and figure out what

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Went wrong

15
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Where did he play

16
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:43,424
Did he start out completely insane ride it was a gradual process

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
And I made it through like

18
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
Maybe three or four of his books before I just got

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Too busy with

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,688
Didn't have a whole lot of time

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
For that

22
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Recreation

23
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
Life's crazy certainly when the late 50s would you

24
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
It started with like

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,232
Bring yourselves together I believe it was the first book

26
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Forestview just kind of left

27
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Nicole's

28
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Start back over on the list

29
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
But yeah maybe I don't know we'll see

30
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Unfortunately

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Discovered I do enjoy reading

32
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
Stuff for the show more than I enjoy

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,712
Necessarily

34
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,904
Society materials Van Nuys Syfy so

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,256
That's where we're at

36
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Not at death

37
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,912
Jeremy Alex Jones Christmas

38
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Ocular to refresh everyone's memory on Christmas Eve

39
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
And through hatchets around the studio

40
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
It was

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
Maybe one of the more fun things we've ever experienced if you've not listened to that episode I highly recommend

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
And everyone go back and listen to last Christmas Eve

43
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
2018 Evansville

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
I couldn't save the bazaar Alex

45
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,376
Tries to hit one of his cameras

46
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
One of his own married

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
Pretty high

48
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,664
Today we're going to be going over December 23rd through 27

49
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Alex's show

50
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,808
And unfortunately it's only actually the 23rd and the 27th

51
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Because Alex took off

52
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,464
For the holidays for Christmas Eve

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,400
That is the best out of

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
The business for the holidays this year

55
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
So 1st Peter thank you so much you're now probably want to come

Janina thank you so much

59
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,863
Kevin thinking about you and I'll probably walk

60
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Next I downloaded

61
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Tik-Tok as a joke

62
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,055
Now I'm hopelessly

63
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Thanks

64
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,175
I downloaded the doctor the broken

00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943

Thank you so much

77
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
I'm a policy wonk

78
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
If you're listening

79
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
Dorothy's dance website

80
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
Bruschetta

81
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
We have

82
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
2 out of context drops

83
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
Christmas indeed

84
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
What is

85
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
But here's the first one

86
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,935
Of course we're crazy

87
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
That seems

88
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
Pretty

89
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
I mean

90
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
The flip side of that

91
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,551
Can almost feel like I'm being a little whiny b****

92
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
Okay

93
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Tops and downs

94
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,791
Christmas music swelling behind

95
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

96
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
So Alex starts on the 23rd

97
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Complaining

98
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,567
Because everyone that he knows any work

99
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Is shadowbanned

100
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
They're all home

101
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:15,295
Well they're all doing such great investigative work but it doesn't matter

102
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
And honestly this just made me laugh

103
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
A lot because

104
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
I would describe this is Alex having a.

105
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
On the episode and getting getting the penalty

106
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
You know one of my greatest frustrations of my greatest joys

107
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
It's that my crew are reporters are researchers just turn out 5

108
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Star research

109
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
And information

110
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
John bowne reports

111
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
Shadowbanned

112
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Millions will see it if not

113
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
The footwash

114
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Shadow

115
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
I feel like it's at.

116
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Sober

117
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,775
Let's take this one more time I just complimented too much

118
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Start it over

119
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,431
So I would say about the first 20 minutes or so this episode is just Alex trying to stress that the audience

120
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
He can't do anything

121
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
He keeps using this metaphor that the audience is

122
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
The gun and he himself

123
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Does creating bullet

124
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
For them to shoot

125
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
These bullets are useless without gun

126
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
Anthony really needs you to shoot people with his information

127
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
I don't like this metaphor

128
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,423
It's. If you're in an infowar

129
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
It's

130
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Particular Focus

131
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Guess on this episode of this idea

132
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,223
It almost feels like there was a meeting behind the scenes where they decided that they really need to focus on raising engagement

133
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
It needs to be the focus

134
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
My s*** you need to shoot the bullets

135
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
Alex also promises there's a big report on Epstein

136
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Incoming

137
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
Babies working on with alleged whistleblower

138
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,055
Sources

139
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Is it going to remove a computer chip from

140
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
I've seen Scorpio or Heritage Studio serger

141
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
Alex also promises a big report on the evils of vaccines

142
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,439
The drop on Christmas morning what you can post all over social media

143
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
Uno's holiday

144
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
Christmas isn't saying happy

145
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Holidays

146
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,911
Producing nonsense anti-vax social media content for everyone to put all over the place

147
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
You wake up you're like what the fuc

148
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
Yeah that makes sense

149
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
Christmas lunch so much better

150
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,639
Do the first 20 minutes half hour of the show is just this

151
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
We got this Epstein report coming

152
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
Back specialist exciting

153
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
So it's very dry territory

154
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
And then Alex

155
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Let us know

156
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
We have big things

157
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
It really was a spy Chief really did overthrow governments on record

158
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631
The character Jack Ryan based on

159
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:17,311
18 years 2002 Switzerland 2002

160
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
February 2015

161
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
He's going to be on with it for now

162
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
I'm starting to bottle that I found

163
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Under Cover the Waterfront

164
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Just wants to get out

165
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Ford

166
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
This year ends

167
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,719
And he's ready to release a lot of information

168
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
I'll just leave it at

169
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Steve

170
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
Chris

171
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Information

172
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
He's got actually a really big revelation

173
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
I will I will say okay

174
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,575
Admission that Steve makes on the show that it for the I don't believe

175
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
True

176
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Would be

177
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Internationally important

178
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,071
Zodiac Killer

179
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Heads of state

180
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
Something definitely

181
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
To the other Christmas

182
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
So his next 12 hours.

183
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
A lot of people are awake

184
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
You know there's a lot of people are awake

185
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Shark

186
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Is it well

187
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,279
When you talked about it being a real victory that all these people are awake

188
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
2 Powerstroke

189
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Picture and what-have-you eat comparison

190
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Is it to a different

191
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Historically

192
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,847
And I do feel like he's comparing that Victory unfavorably to the current victory

193
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
You know it was 3% started in

194
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Saw through the Revolutionary War against

195
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Empire never been defeated

196
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
Blazing gentlemen we probably got

197
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,671
30% of the public to hardcore aware now know how

198
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
System works

199
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
It was probably

200
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
10%

201
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
5 years ago

202
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Check

203
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
You got 30%

204
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Where what's going on

205
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
They decide to move and take action you cannot mccleave militarily

206
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Spiritually

207
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Explain something here

208
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
This isn't

209
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
Overly positive statements true

210
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
We have one

211
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
We won back at Calvary where Jesus Christ

212
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,071
God took on our sins to sacrifice

213
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
I gave us an example

214
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Kalimba

215
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
We really won now

216
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
And the globalist know that they want to take as many innocent people with them as they can

217
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
20 Souls

218
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,575
So I don't know you wanted a couple days before Christmas particularly wanted

219
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
Jesus died for your sins that was a victory but now

220
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Just based on sentence

221
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,607
Structure that Alex believe somehow 30% of the population

222
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,191
Believing what he believes victory

223
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
Jesus dying for our sins on the cross

224
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
I believe

225
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
I believe he is comparing

226
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
His current

227
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,039
Tim Chipman little bit on the Revolutionary War 2

228
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,927
Anything. Also an insult to the 30% where he's like it only took 3% to start the Revolutionary War

229
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
Percent 10 times

230
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,631
Yeah there's a piece of

231
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
The Revolutionary War

232
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Integrating

233
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,103
What should be a pivotal moment in history for him

234
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Jesus

235
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,711
Write Jesus on Christmas

236
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,831
You have to throw a little shade on him and tell him that he's eating to s*** right

237
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,183
Did you started the victory but the real Victory is

238
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,535
Did Jesus dying on the cross tell 30% of the population of

239
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
No no

240
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,679
3%

241
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Praise Jesus on this his

242
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Aaliyah's birthday

243
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Maybe next time you'll treasure up to me but

244
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
I got this one buddy

245
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Weird

246
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,455
So Alex got news

247
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
Just tons of it

248
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Stuff to

249
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Like

250
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
Comedian Michelle wolf tomato joke

251
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
Alex is not happy about it

252
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
This is cancer

253
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
And wants to normalize

254
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
It's up to you

255
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
But here is Michelle wolf in her latest

256
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,007
Event on stage in front of a couple thousand people cheering

257
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Talk about a mother

258
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Killing her baby

259
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,151
So that she has power and place God

260
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
There's never been a more safe

261
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
Mechanically pure statement made

262
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
This is the definition

263
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
I'm Satanism here.

264
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,999
So negatively that you feel like you should have his sense of Shame after you get an abortion

265
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
Anyway you want after you get an abortion

266
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Very powerful

267
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,431
You know people say you can't play God

268
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
I like a baby like Morgan Freeman

269
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
Don't knock it till you try it

270
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
Really knocking you going to get that baby out of there

271
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
Normalizing that are mothers

272
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Power

273
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,591
Is killing her baby for her own satanic selfishness and enjoying it and

274
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Sharing it

275
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,271
You can see what's going on if this is completely bizarre like

276
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
Very recent past

277
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,879
Speech type

278
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
Especially as it relates to Comedy

279
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,743
All the people complaining about racism or just

280
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
Tide sjws

281
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
PewDiePie's just joking when he has people hold up signs that say kill the Jews

282
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,215
It's totally a fun joke how count dankula

283
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,823
Comedy

284
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,943
But now Michelle wolf has made a jokey disagrees with so it's pure satanism

285
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
It's just sad

286
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
He is lazy as hell

287
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,671
Alex provides Michelle wolf made is normalize in something

288
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Any other jokes

289
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
Arnot

290
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,375
The exact same line of attack he's taking here applies equally well to count dankula suppose joke

291
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
He's normalizing Nazism

292
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,775
Here Alex is embody in DeBary Behavior he claims to hate so much in the left

293
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
Call Joseph Watson

294
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
I would make a video

295
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Complaining that he's virtue signaling

296
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
This is ridiculous is he

297
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Went out

298
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
His way

299
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
After

300
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
Promo

301
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Asian accent

302
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:32,255
Cuz the lives

303
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
And now we're getting

304
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
I can't handle it

305
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,751
All I hear is exhausted screeching

306
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
More offended

307
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
That's it

308
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Good Times

309
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Is there

310
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,415
Did you hear more news about Michelle wolf cuz I feel like that's going to come up with

311
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,767
Probably just come back up later bye

312
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Not in any greater.

313
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,351
Detailed Michelle wolf is a Satanist

314
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Did you know

315
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Subway

316
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
Town of cannibals was discovered

317
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Because it wasn't

318
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
But Alex's report

319
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
Civilizations are discovered

320
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Had plenty of water and plenty of food when they collapsed

321
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
And there's not even signs of disease

322
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
They're all gone

323
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
You know they always find

324
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Giant

325
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
A skeleton

326
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
That have been

327
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
53 months ago archaeologists in Germany found

328
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Town in Germany

329
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
It's about eight thousand years old

330
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
Tens of thousands of

331
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Skeletons

332
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
LMN butchered and eaten

333
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,135
And the scientists studied and found out they were

334
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
People from all over Europe

335
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Some of them

336
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Over 2000 miles away

337
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
I want to cover that story on

338
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Are you going to talk

339
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Stone Age

340
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Found found

341
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
In Germany

342
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
Cannibalism in like why would they do that

343
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
That sounds

344
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Out there

345
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
Just doesn't seem like a sustainable model really

346
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,559
Alex is talking about a recent discovery in modern-day Poland of a site

347
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,679
Well me to be fair the Germanic tribes and so there

348
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Computershare

349
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,031
At this site archaeologist a sound 12 burial

350
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
The first-century BCE

351
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
What are the things that they're saying is really notable

352
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
About this find is it

353
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
People

354
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Different types of

355
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
The funeral rituals

356
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,391
That isn't super shocking since Poland is in the middle of an area where there's a rich archaeological

357
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
Very old sites from various Germanic tribes

358
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
Beantown fairly regularly

359
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
Would still not

360
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
Why that's the case is not completely answered

361
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,191
Why are there so many different styles of burial

362
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
In the same site

363
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
So the varying funeral tradition

364
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Does the presence of trinkets were pretty far away

365
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
Are both aspects of

366
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
To the site to make it a very compelling

367
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
Literally nothing I can find about this

368
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
The story involves

369
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
There's no indication that anyone was brought

370
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
To this town from far away to be eaten

371
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,463
There are no archeologist to resetting the actual site or saying any of this

372
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Got to stop

373
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Quite frankly unless there's some stories that I'm missing and I've read a number of them

374
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
I'm inclined to say that I was literally making all of this

375
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
That's not fair you have to

376
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,359
Take cannibalism a little more seriously dad

377
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Not something you can joke about

378
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
I have two possible explanations

379
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Think might be going on

380
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,855
The first is that he might be making this up

381
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,927
Because I know that you never read stories

382
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
He's just irritated lines and I'm Rick's on them

383
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,071
The headline in the express about the discovery of the site is quote

384
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Archaeology shop

385
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,447
Gruesome discovery of mass Graves and mystery Ernst tons archaeology

386
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,055
Would you could see Alex turning into a story of finding the remains of a cannibal community

387
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
It's gruesome

388
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Express

389
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:37,247
The rest of the details that Alex repeats

390
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
Most of them are in

391
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
The sub-headline

392
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
So I will be a pretty easy

393
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
But Alex just saw the headlines

394
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
His brain interpreted it and turned it to what we just heard

395
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Another that's based on anything

396
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Acceptance f*****-up head

397
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
The other possible explanation is that Alex has taken

398
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,191
Details from this new dig site and combining details about her

399
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,055
A very famous Graves that was discovered in 1996

400
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383
And definitely showed signs of ritualistic cannibalism

401
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Taking place

402
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
The time about 5000 BC

403
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
A 2009 study

404
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
Did strongly suggest

405
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
But the inhabitants there

406
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
Is cannibalism based on particular

407
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Sound on

408
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
IPhones

409
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,768
But that's not really a consensus among the academic

410
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,352
Some believe that it's more likely that the Dead

411
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,960
They had ritual performed

412
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
For being buried

413
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,568
Which isn't too historically archaeologically unheard-of

414
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
The point here is that

415
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,992
Even if I were to just combine these two sites into one even the most ghastly stuff about her side is not

416
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Concretely proven

417
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,368
And there's a large element of the story that absolutely just coming from Alex and his imagination

418
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
They all collapsed

419
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
Absent

420
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
To cannibalism Define

421
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,008
Alex will always bring up cannibalism if he is hungry

422
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,848
That is my new theory that I'm working on

423
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,152
Cuz everytime you bring do cannibals

424
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
He does have a certain amount of like

425
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
Things to eat people Easter just nausea

426
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
They pull the marrow out of their bones

427
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
I want a chicken

428
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,000
That's just how I feel about it

429
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
I don't know how we would test

430
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
Maybe we start sending Snickers bars

431
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
Whovian for Studio

432
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:34,496
Language stops shut off the Snickers bars

433
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
Cannibalism

434
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,408
It's the it's the 23rd Alex knows he's going on break after this for

435
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Holiday

436
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
There is not

437
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Much Christmas talk

438
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
That's not surprised

439
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,208
Surprising to me I don't think he's feeling great Christmas

440
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
Dover Mall

441
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,840
Is not enough atmosphere is coursework

442
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
There's a little bit of religious talk

443
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
The same standards.

444
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,544
Base better than when was weird that was weird

445
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
But dear God gave him a mission

446
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
We've got to strike

447
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
God isn't giving us this time

448
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
Providence

449
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Directions

450
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Because we're so great

451
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
It's happening because we're willing to do it

452
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
God will use these imperfect

453
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,584
We have been given the commission

454
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
We will carry it out

455
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
And I'll tell you this

456
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
A lot of people can see that I

457
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,336
It's almost 40 lb now

458
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
The same way I was

459
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Except

460
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
Religiously taking the supplements boo Christmas spirit

461
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
The reason for the season is a lot of

462
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Episode

463
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Constant

464
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,912
Goddamnit Mission I'm going to carry it out and I'll tell you what I've lost a lot of weight everyone knows it

465
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,824
More like supplement my friends actually

466
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
It's really intense

467
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
That's the level of pivot

468
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
What's going on

469
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
Episode

470
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
You know these guys they just

471
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
These are the same people

472
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,648
Materialistic

473
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,488
Sewing material

474
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
Alex goes back from break

475
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
Talk about some of the good stuff

476
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,704
The tapping in the world some of the signs that things are going well

477
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
And one of them has to do with the

478
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Making up numbers

479
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
Bowling numbers

480
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,712
But something I want to get into right now it's a very good news

481
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Young people in major polls

482
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
At several articles on it

483
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Against

484
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Abortion

485
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Anytime

486
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
And it's accelerating

487
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
The younger people get

488
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
And the teenagers

489
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
About 70% in mothballs

490
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Amarillo sexy

491
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
A niche

492
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Women

493
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Girls that are leading

494
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
The charging that

495
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
What shows all their propaganda is backfire

496
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,712
Until the attempt to say oh it's fun to kill babies try it out well that's not going to work either

497
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Volition

498
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Against Michelle wolf

499
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Yeah

500
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,184
Michelle wolf

501
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,304
I can't even find anything close to the data that Alex is using no idea

502
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Like nothing I can find comes

503
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
Close to the contention at 6

504
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
Sixty-two 70% of young people are opposed

505
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Abortion

506
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
In fact all the credible data I can

507
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
Find on this issue is the exact

508
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Opposite

509
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
A Pew research

510
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,968
From this summer

511
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
61%

512
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,320
Which is the highest point that question is pulled at in over 20 years

513
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,648
The only groups that have levels of opposition to abortion there

514
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,232
Close 2077

515
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
Percent Republicans at 62%

516
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
I honestly have no idea

517
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,704
Talking about never says I can't find an article

518
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
Just making it Up song meme or something

519
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,616
I don't know

520
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,968
Youth Bible Study Bible study at the church that he doesn't go to

521
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Something like that because

522
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
What

523
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Yeah

524
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,392
I don't think people are opposed to all aboard

525
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
Daisies

526
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,816
I don't know any every single article that I can find as headlines like the neck

527
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,912
Generation is leading the charge

528
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Reproductive health

529
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Like all of them

530
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
I don't know I don't know about

531
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
The next generation is either

532
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,456
They are leading the charge in the fight to make the world a better place or they're destroying

533
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
Craft Brewery

534
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,808
Those are the only two types of article about

535
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,160
There's more ideological diversity in

536
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
The young set

537
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,304
Then some articles May painted to be

538
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Can't find

539
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Actual indication

540
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:21,728
Sixty-two 70% Universal opposition to abortion

541
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
Especially among young women

542
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
You know

543
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,592
I don't know I don't know

544
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:30,944
Citations

545
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
It is not given

546
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
So

547
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,112
This is interesting Alex plays Special Report

548
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
Baby was hungry needed to get a snack maybe around enough

549
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,256
Alex play the Special Report

550
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
You can call it a special report

551
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
It's really just a segment of Howard Stern Show

552
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,192
Compression making fun of him

553
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,080
The whole thing is a guy doing the impression he's at Hawking products shamelessly and saying stupid s***

554
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
Pretty accurate piece of parity

555
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,736
Honestly I feel like Alex would only play play that if he thought his

556
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
Politely on the hook

557
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,624
Because the risk of them seeing something make someone making fun of how Alex Cel shiting realizing

558
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
That's not parody

559
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:21,120
A high likelihood

560
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,728
F****** making you tell me I'm wearing clothes I don't even give a s*** anymore

561
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
But I suspect at this point Alex needs to

562
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
Self-aggrandizing

563
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,920
More then he needs to pretend he isn't just running an extended conspiracy info

564
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,760
So the fact that he's important enough to be made fun of by Howard Stern

565
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
It's something he could Bank on

566
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
Yeah but he's the biggest radio show ever the last

567
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
Did 20 years yeah they make fun of me because I'm relevant

568
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
About me is people not talk

569
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,864
Hey so is it that yeah

570
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
I get that

571
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
The whole cycle

572
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
That's crazy

573
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Extended

574
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
After that

575
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
We get our gas

576
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,808
Merry Christmas to all our audience and adopters

577
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Heilbrunn

578
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
That's how long he's been around

579
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Delta Force

580
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
A whole bunch of stuff since then

581
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,816
These are record

582
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,656
Call in federal court over at I mean it's so we got to be careful.

583
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,216
Here on Arabi, source

584
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,032
Is always Q fantasies a stuffy this is a real guy

585
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
Okay

586
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
The Steve is on

587
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:45,344
Episode

588
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
You really good.

589
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
He's defensive

590
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:55,072
The first time he went through Steve's I was like are you telling me or you telling you

591
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
Because

592
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
I'm not convinced

593
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Either way

594
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
I swear to God

595
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
He's not busy

596
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,568
I think he might have gone to Korea for me guys

597
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Think he might have

598
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
He didn't but I think it's really interesting that Alex

599
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,344
Preface this by saying

600
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,440
Leo says something he should not say on air

601
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Israelis did not know

602
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
This is a first

603
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
DD's right hand man

604
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,784
Assassinated

605
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
Because he was so.

606
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Function

607
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:55,232
I don't want to play games where I start taking anything Steve says seriously

608
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,584
But it's fun

609
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
Is he Brown yeah it seems like it

610
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,360
I'm not even that he was just he just told somebody that

611
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,760
You seem depressed and then they assassination sentence

612
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
Explains it later anyway so Mike Massad guys

613
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,584
Just so you know I'm worried about I guess we should get him some help know you killed okay well you know there are two ways

614
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
To solve that problem

615
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
In the Clinton years

616
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:47,456
Steve's fake story

617
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
No no

618
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Into the Clinton

619
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:01,536
I assume that

620
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
I bet

621
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,824
Man I don't know answer

622
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,504
Maybe it is part of his mythology that he was there under Clinton but either way

623
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Neither ship

624
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Alex

625
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Really want Steve to talk about Epps

626
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,392
Episode really wants

627
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
How to get Steve take on it

628
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Meanwhile

629
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Steve wants to

630
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,792
To promote his new memoir

631
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424
Oh my God that is going to be the greatest

632
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,776
Workout Alex is not

633
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
All that interested in helping

634
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Steve

635
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
Okay really want to talk

636
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
He gets a little bit more than he asked

637
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
Because Steve is still on the air

638
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
Epstein is still alive

639
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,136
Kik

640
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Epstein was working

641
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,560
The compromised people on behalf of the Mossad Israeli intelligence

642
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
Is not a road

643
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,240
In the past we've seen Alex be confronted by

644
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,288
Conspiracy theories coming from Steve

645
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,896
Who often resistor Insanity for a little while but time he starts to weaken

646
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
Stevens very persuasive

647
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Alex is gullible

648
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,528
We start to see this Dynamic playing out

649
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Again

650
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
It is true that

651
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
The body they took all the stretcher

652
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,184
Mainline photos AP you name it

653
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
Is not the same here that you're does even look

654
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
Everybody ran

655
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
That is a real photo

656
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
And it's not

657
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Even the same

658
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Ear looks nothing like it

659
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,592
So Alex is now helping Steve create

660
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,688
Support for Speedster

661
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
That's wild

662
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Riddle

663
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,904
Even if the pictures used for comparison had no obvious problems with them would still probably mean

664
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
But they do have serious problem

665
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
41

666
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
The picture of Epstein alive

667
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
The use for the comparison

668
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
Is was taking 15 years

669
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:17,472
The only facial features features that are supposedly suspicious and being different in the pictures

670
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
Are the nose and ears

671
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,384
Wicker made of cartilage change in appearance over time sometimes significant

672
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,736
Changes over time is cartilage

673
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
Your ears are all

674
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
This is some super flimsy Superdome conspiracy clickbait

675
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Pieczenik

676
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
In the past I've talked a lot about how Alex

677
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,072
What's keeps getting food by Steven

678
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Honestly

679
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,888
I've seen it happen enough now and I key

680
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
Keep seeing Alex.

681
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
To himself

682
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
I don't know if he thinks that what he's doing is Playing devil's

683
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Reality

684
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
I was just talking

685
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
Sailfin to believe in Steve

686
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
Just been a huge disaster I don't know why he keeps doing this

687
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,808
It seems like he's always doing a two-man game with Steve that he doesn't know he's a

688
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Depart of

689
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
Because

690
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
He is

691
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
He is respecting Steve for being

692
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:16,608
Probably is involved.

693
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312
You have to believe that he set in motion literally every important thing that it happened to the geopolitical scene

694
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,104
I feel like last 50 years

695
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
He's the most

696
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
Important figure in the world

697
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
I can't even put it into words everything from prior to and Post 9

698
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
911

699
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,696
Including nidal

700
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
But

701
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
But Alex is always trying to like

702
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:50,144
You liking that cuz I was like okay well you said something that sounds crazy but

703
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:56,800
You know when you think about it the ear didn't look the same so I you I suppose you know that part of your battery is Iraq that's the

704
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
Even Wednesday.

705
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
There were actors

706
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Alex was

707
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,160
Maybe that's why I think

708
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
Try to play Devil's Advocate

709
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
It is not good at it

710
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Yams of tricking

711
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Himself

712
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
Mulder shouldn't play devil.

713
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Advocate

714
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
So

715
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
Dino steps

716
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
I'm still alive

717
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,704
I also

718
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
The temperature is

719
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,336
It's as if the Swarm

720
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,872
The swan song for the Democrat

721
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Also

722
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Into

723
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:44,672
Impeachment

724
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,024
In this movie where is Columbine

725
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
This is her swansong that this is the swan song the entire House of Representatives

726
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,520
What we really don't need

727
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,944
We're not a democracy if we had a democracy

728
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
Computers

729
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,880
And just voting

730
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Abbott

731
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
DeSantis will become more important

732
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,584
So representative government

733
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:31,776
Processes

734
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,360
The stripper whale

735
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,152
Fascist

736
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:42,784
10:58 that I-5

737
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,368
Doesn't seem to at all recognize that what he's talking about

738
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Like pretty much come

739
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
Complete deconstruction of

740
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,256
A lot of the structure of government that

741
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Is in the concert

742
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
It does seem like

743
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Alex loves

744
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
And defend the Constitution against

745
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,680
All attack

746
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
But

747
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,312
If he likes you and you say you want to remove the Constitution entirely

748
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,896
He's like yeah that sounds cool if you want to knock down pillars of the West

749
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:14,272
Due process to as long as you are fun

750
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,576
Adjusting like you just wants to rewrite

751
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,880
The Constitution into

752
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
Just the second

753
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,768
The Constitution that they all want is just don't take

754
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Yeah that's

755
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,104
Also Steve is responsible for the chakra beam

756
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Big news

757
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:46,272
He was depressed I can't believe this didn't make all the disintegrator

758
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,672
I really would have time to talk

759
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
Spy chief

760
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,256
Kill you

761
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
Jon michaux

762
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,424
That's a big bombshell another another

763
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Michelle is it apparently

764
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,496
I don't know I guess

765
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,056
Steve is a member of The Screen Actors Guild

766
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,592
Hollywood is finished

767
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
When you get a movie

768
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,992
The Irishman 180 million

769
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
Education

770
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
Decent decent shoots his mouth

771
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,408
Largely to give you a Flavour of like

772
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
This is kind of a lot of house

773
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Steve talks

774
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
This makes no sense

775
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
Knossos T votes for the Oscars

776
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,720
Kind of believe that maybe if I don't know if any of the movies that Tom Clancy's had made

777
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,840
Did Steve has anything to do

778
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:09,472
Force or cyberteam or whatever novel

779
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Siri right

780
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
Like what he has a producer's credit

781
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,736
Give me the PGA was involved in the TV show

782
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,064
Tom Clancy was trying to make

783
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,624
Sorry Terry Hamblin

784
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
Maybe

785
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:33,792
Is the most maybe you're in one

786
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,424
Assassinate but I do think he is in the academy

787
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Even that being said

788
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,896
I don't trust things that you saying is why he wouldn't for the Irish

789
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
And they're both weird one is budget

790
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
The other is

791
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
Robert De Niro's political views

792
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
That is just ramble

793
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,024
Yes just a rambling old man who wants to tell you about like I don't like his movies. Does he talk s***

794
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,912
I killed Yitzhak rabin's and Robert De Niro talks too much

795
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Also he said he would vote for

796
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
For Harriet

797
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,800
Sure

798
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
You're voting for Harriet

799
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,408
Because it only cost 3 million

800
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,040
I didn't I didn't think that was a huge huge

801
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
Whenever Steve is allowed to talk

802
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
For an extender

803
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Stretch of time

804
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
Alex

805
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,584
The science that he starts to pick up on them

806
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
But

807
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
Not good

808
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,984
Pushing back at it like this

809
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,360
Secede from the Union

810
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Florida

811
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,967
Secede from the union wouldn't eat the rest of the Union

812
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
The South

813
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,231
Size of Abraham Lincoln

814
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,119
The 12 Days of Christmas seeking salespad come to Infowars

815
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
The rise of Lincoln

816
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:29,503
So I think it Steven super super naive about what it would look like for either Texas or Florida to secede from the United States

817
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
41

818
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
They would then become independent

819
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,135
Countries made after workout trade arrangements with

820
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
With the rest of the United States

821
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,743
As well as other countries difficult particularly

822
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
Without being able to enjoy

823
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,583
Rate of the rest of the US economy that really helps

824
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
Create those

825
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Trade relationship

826
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
I'm pretty sure he is assuming

827
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,031
That they do not even need those and they will self-sufficient Nation

828
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,079
Obviously

829
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,127
Because they have all the resources

830
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,759
Are some resources economy

831
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,599
Geographically neither Texas North Florida is what you call

832
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Optimal

833
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
Possession

834
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,183
Florida's basically a peninsula of the United

835
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:14,303
States and Texas wouldn't even be able to block off transit to and from South and Central America

836
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
Since Thursday New Mexico and Arizona border

837
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
Consider even be able to

838
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,007
Create some sort of a blockhead

839
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,663
Create essentialness for some kind of Leverage

840
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,759
If they leave the United States federal government guess what else have

841
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,831
The US federal government stop sending them money

842
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:41,695
Because Red State make all the money and give them

843
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:46,559
Everybody knows that that's been backed up over and over and over again please do not to disagree

844
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:52,959
The past year Florida received over 237 billion dollars from the federal government 2100

845
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
87

846
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Dollars per resident

847
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Of the state

848
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
Texas took in about 200

849
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
69 billion dollars

850
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,919
These are the second and third highest totals of

851
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Any state in the

852
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
So sure

853
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
Keep yelling you're dumb dumb s*** that

854
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,135
The South has risen again

855
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
This

856
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951
The reality would Steve a thing

857
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767
What are you suggesting would be a complete disaster

858
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,559
Pastor for the people in Texas

859
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
With all due respect

860
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Florida and Texas

861
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
I care about the rest

862
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
To both of those States

863
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,359
Maybe a relative inconvenience for the rest of the United States

864
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
Yes

865
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
The restaurant

866
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
A conference somewhere else

867
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,063
We are Georgia

868
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,623
To make that work

869
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,439
It would be a disaster for those dates

870
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
Inconvenience

871
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,279
To do it obviously is yours

872
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,167
RX-8 United absolute prices of stuff

873
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
It would be a

874
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,519
Bummer but after after a while we'd all be like

875
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
This is the new reality let's move

876
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
Be Wild

877
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
Texas

878
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
I guess

879
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,431
I have to go bankrupt like Moody's

880
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,991
Remove their credit rating and turn it into just a

881
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Stevens

882
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,207
Taking responsibility for killing eats a krabby

883
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,023
Claire's the end the representational government

884
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,327
The Oscars

885
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:28,959
You said the South can rise secede

886
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
Answer now

887
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:35,103
He starts rambling a long time but how he took down the Soviet Union

888
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
They are really is and I did I want to know about the technology that Scorsese

889
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,903
Nothing

890
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:54,047
So he just talked about how it was him

891
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
The first person

892
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
Singular

893
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
Took quite a bit

894
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,799
I think Alex is defensiveness

895
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Set up again

896
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:12,991
A lot of this sounds like the people like this got some crazy all these guys race but I've actually went to the history books you did run

897
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
Do work around talk about your intelligence often sit around a bar bragging and patting each other on the

898
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,375
Still a little bit

899
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,935
Cigarette

900
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
Recognizing

901
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
Completely unhinged

902
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
There's no way

903
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:45,247
All of this is one person's lived experience

904
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
It's

905
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,855
Gila Steve I know this sounds like there are only two actual

906
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,439
For what you're saying my show and a mental health facility

907
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,279
But I really do believe you when you say what did you just say again

908
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
Got to get you off my shop

909
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Has Mexico

910
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
Start taking some

911
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Scholars want to talk

912
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Steve

913
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Harassed

914
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
If there's anything they can do to get

915
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
Get Trump to get

916
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,015
Is that the one Steve isn't

917
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
And he needs to toughen

918
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Needs to get mad

919
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:25,695
Needs to bring Steven to run never fire everybody

920
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,047
To make Melania Secretary of State Driver

921
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,071
Yeah

922
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
Scholar

923
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,119
The answer is

924
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,215
Is there anything we can do to come together

925
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:41,055
To show President Trump and no matter what were with him

926
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
So he can start

927
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,895
Expediting his

928
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,783
Excellent point

929
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
Becky should

930
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,183
Together within your own group

931
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
Twitter

932
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
Communicate

933
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,839
We support we need to have

934
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:10,239
Trojan the next Administration

935
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:16,127
When you have a chance with present value for the general public says that's a fact

936
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,687
There's some real comedy embedded there

937
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,343
People can do to help get Trump to toughen up on his enemies and Steve's

938
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
Answers write some letters

939
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,415
What a lame answer

940
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,255
Now it says the Trump really listens to people

941
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,023
Good plan

942
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
You may recall

943
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:40,447
The trumps campaign was characterized by

944
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,775
Tells me that's about as strong as message you could give

945
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:52,991
If Trump is going to listen to chanting crowds I doubt he's going to give a s*** about your letters that he's never going to see to begin with

946
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
Is every Latter-day Saint

947
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,087
Every letter he also keeps a list

948
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:02,719
Who's been naughty or nice greater message do you need crowds chanting lock her up

949
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,791
What what more would you is there a paper trail

950
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,703
You can't prove that that you can't even prove he was there no one wrote lock her up

951
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
The real problem

952
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
So

953
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,359
It was next clip Steve talks

954
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,383
About

955
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,943
You know he has a bit more of a Christian Street

956
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:28,063
Disappearance than I've heard in him lately

957
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,623
Sing weird

958
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:34,719
Leading religious

959
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
Like I watch them

960
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,583
Milo yiannopoulos interview Nick Fuentes

961
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
Not too long ago

962
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,447
And Milo is very Catholic

963
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,007
I don't remember being part of his

964
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:50,079
Rams

965
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,871
Steve is is talking

966
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
It is nice Kobe's lamenting that

967
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
Fundamentalist Christians

968
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Can't get along with each other

969
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,087
Fundamentalist Christians can't get along with each other

970
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,439
There has to be an ecumenical council we're in in America

971
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:10,815
Understanding the most powerful tools

972
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:14,399
It's not my ability to manipulate

973
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:21,823
True

974
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,223
The 12 Days of Christmas super sale has come to Infowars

975
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Christmas sale now

976
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:36,159
Just keeps happening

977
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
Yeah so Steve believes that

978
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
He doesn't have a

979
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,583
Even thinks fundamentalist Christian is a

980
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
Troubling term

981
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,679
Believes it to be like that needs

982
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,727
Get together and if you listen

983
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:53,055
2D saying cuz he claims that he overthrew the Soviet Union

984
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
Christianity

985
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,455
Lead YouTube

986
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,503
Fundamentalist Christians to overthrow our

987
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
Yes that does sound like

988
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Exactly what you were

989
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,599
It's not good

990
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
That's that's not good

991
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
That's not good

992
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,951
The colonels of what he's putting out

993
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:17,375
To imply something very scary to overthrow the United States government

994
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:24,799
I guess he thinks he's going to be somewhere in the ruling Council when it happens

995
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
What is

996
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,127
Carmen

997
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,199
There's a picture of the world that he

998
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
In his mind

999
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
I don't think even he

1000
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
Find it to be pretty

1001
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:43,487
You know it's like

1002
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:48,607
People are holding hands and s*** like that I really feel like he's just

1003
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,631
People up

1004
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,471
Flicking their nipples

1005
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,543
Feudalism

1006
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
At work

1007
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:02,175

Flatter the s*** out of Alex in order to make him feel validated

1010
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,791
Prediction

00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,615
It's very interesting to watch

1023
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Like there is a

1024
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,687
Pretending we didn't have a falling out

1025
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711
Analogous

1026
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
Gracefully getting back

1027
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,135
Testing the boundaries he's throwing out Epstein still alive should I killed in soccer

The pope to help inject Christianity into the Soviet

1031
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,935
Steve pieczenik

1032
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
Soother

1033
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,775
Cope Whisperer

Comes back on the 27th

1036
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,247
I'm going to say he's coming in hot

1037
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Number 27

1038
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,391
He claims that it just because he hasn't been on here for a little while so your team

1039
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
Reality

1040
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Because

1041
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
Giving a press conference

1042
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Where

1043
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,791
He was asked about pardoning Rodger

1044
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,095
Firestone and he said he hadn't really thought about it

1045
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Is really pissed off

1046
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,495
Christmas 12 days we took off

1047
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,151
Trump at a press conference and he talked about

1048
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:15,551
Waterstone because of the question really thought about that which means he's not right

1049
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:22,207
Obviously he has talked about it did you ran out of sight with a Rodger was obviously wrong

1050
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,119
Close minded

1051
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:35,007
The Congress that's a formality and that's not

1052
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,055
I know you won't know that but

1053
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,103
There speaks the whole issue

1054
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,919
The trouble started doubting me

1055
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
Frog

1056
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,759
Herman agency

1057
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
What does it say if they're just left

1058
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
Stallone

1059
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,647
It says it's open season

1060
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Supports Trump

1061
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,791
It's okay Sean Hannity's Ray lose his job so soccer Carlton

1062
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Alex Jones

1063
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,095
Prison

1064
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
It's doing the hell out of man

1065
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,447
What about my family in

1066
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,519
Play Informer poison tell huge lies so I'm going to have to sue

1067
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
Other people

Shmoney

1069
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,455
Into this and Trump in the moment and I love Trump

1070
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:22,367
But his biggest failure is that he can adjust apartment to do their damn job illegally spying on a candidates doing it

1071
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,695
Monster president

1072
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,071
That's what got CIA hearings and defense department hearings

1073
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:36,959
Military coming after me it's the ivy Leaguers that have intelligence

1074
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
Clarence's

1075
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,847
Literally calling me on enemy agents and talking about how they're trying to shut me down

1076
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,383
Newtown

1077
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
I'm American citizen

1078
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,015
Run over by a bunch of America

1079
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,831
Openly say they hate this country

1080
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
In Congress and I'm not

1081
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695

Use Me Lord

1083
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
People should be

1084
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
These people

1085
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,727
He's a God damn them

1086
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
Cut that out

1087
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:15,359
In the version

1088
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,151
They do have a delay

1089
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,199
Because they were able to cut that out

1090
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
Used pickup

1091
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Clips from

1092
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,063
But he does say God damn them

1093
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
Clip

1094
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,815
The right of it was

1095
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,351
General

1096
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
Two specific

1097
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,679
Very very personal

1098
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:45,311
Very very much Erin of grievances that were about my own trouble

1099
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,639
Personally so hot

1100
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,687
I would like him to fix that

1101
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,527
Yeah it starts with like the justice department

1102
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
People are being sold

1103
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
You make that

1104
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,743
Even at exactly even longer just

1105
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,279
Complaining about his own s***

1106
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,351
I meant he has to clarify

1107
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,447
Kind of making this all about myself

1108
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,239
Vengeance is God's

1109
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,175
We need action

1110
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,247
And it's not for me being under attack

1111
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
Because criminals are getting more bold

1112
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,111
Enter intimidating a lot of other people

1113
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
Getting them to give up

1114
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,975
I don't know I think it's just

1115
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,839
Himself letter-writing campaign could get

1116
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:46,239
It's true actually Alex launches something of an initiative here on this episode

1117
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
Clips that I have

1118
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,055
But it's more or less

1119
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
Let's start protesting at Trump rallies

1120
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,783
Okay he does he talks about a little bit he's like I don't want this to be like Nick Fuentes going out

1121
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,831
Messing around with

1122
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,135
Leading to a scism

1123
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
We want to be friendly

1124
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,231
But also inject our message

1125
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,535
Protesting

1126
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:15,167
You guys are just doing the sectarian 8in to create more

1127
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,239
Like extremist savior communities

1128
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Inspired by Aldi

1129
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
Go ahead

1130
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:24,127
It's like they're falling ass backwards into understanding how protest

1131
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,687
It's so

1132
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
Yeah it's so

1133
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Step

1134
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,807
So Alex is not doing great

1135
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:37,951
Trump is going to continue throughout this episode here on the 27th

1136
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,511
Confused State about his support for

1137
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
For Trump

1138
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,351
Susie Astic yes

1139
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,399
Of course I support him but also like

1140
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
I'm really pissed off

1141
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,703
I'm starting to get

1142
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,983
Really frustrated

1143
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,263
Which is inevitable

1144
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,847
They just hate people protesting so much whenever it's

1145
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,919
You're not on my team you can't protest

1146
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:01,503
But then whenever they want something they realize that the best way to get it is by

1147
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,527
Protesting

1148
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,575
It isn't

1149
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:10,975
It's not going to go

1150
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
Alex

1151
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Complains

1152
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,679
That like

1153
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
Justice not doing their job

1154
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
And a big part of that is they need to f***

1155
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
In jail

1156
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
It's open-and-shut

1157
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,687
Giuliani was on TV talking about how he's going to eat if he just had two people

1158
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,479
And they put him in a position where

1159
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,527
Prosecute all these dirty actors

1160
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
All of them

1161
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,575
And Alex agrees

1162
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
Based on

1163
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,559
Peter Tork Giuliani

1164
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
He all he needs a two people

1165
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
Thinking about all this supposed to totally true

1166
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,471
You could convince these people

1167
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
With your eyes shut

1168
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,615
My God they went all over TV and said

1169
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:04,479
Well you're their investigating my son so I should have that guy's not tired all the time I leave in 6 hours

1170
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,039
Billion dollars

1171
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Sumbitch

1172
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,231
Sit here and put up with that crap

1173
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:21,887
Is really mad easily convinced that the case against Joe Biden to be open and shut because like

1174
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,191
Classic television

1175
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,215
And confessed his crime

1176
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,639
If you pay close attention though you'll notice how Alex Jones

1177
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,431
The gauges of narrative sleight-of-hand

1178
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
He's so worked up in his feelings

1179
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,783
Inflows

1180
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:43,903
But he's very intentionally inserted Ally in there that's meant to support the very passion that he's expressing

1181
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,463
Prosecutor fired

1182
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,255
Because they were investigating his son

1183
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,327
But the rest of the stuff that Alex is saying is true

1184
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:57,727
It is much as I did give a speech retold the story of threatening to hold up money to Ukraine

1185
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,287
This truth is only there

1186
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
Damask the presentation of the LIE

1187
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
Which is the bike

1188
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,895
Motives were personal

1189
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Interrupt

1190
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,223
This is a pretty important trick or propagandistic

1191
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:08,991
Conspiracy theory

1192
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,087
Most of the time and audience liked Alex's probably wouldn't even notice

1193
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,927
Most of them are probably they already believe is true

1194
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,487
Intertwining lies with real thing

1195
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,279
Things you create a situation where you can

1196
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
Play play

1197
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,863
Saying that they had until he got on his plane

1198
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
To fire the prosecutor

1199
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,471
And your audience will experience it as if the motive

1200
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,799
The part the part where you trying to stop investigation of his son

1201
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,591
That's what being proven

1202
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
The clip the Dozen

1203
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,919
You can prove the true part

1204
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
But the LIE is a lie

1205
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
Connect to the truth to a lie

1206
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,039
Then demonstrate the truth

1207
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,623
And plenty of people accept the alai as part of the demonstrated true

1208
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,671
I'm super basic level

1209
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,975
This is kind of what I looked up all the time with headlight

1210
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,303
You can prove that line by flashing YouTube on the screen

1211
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
Can't really prove

1212
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,399
Nonsense bulshit that he rips about the story

1213
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:03,263
So when he tries to establish something he says is true he just references headline

1214
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,847
Example consider Bill Joyce article in wired

1215
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,639
Why the future doesn't need us

1216
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:13,759
Alex is that a thousand times that article was about how Bill Joy went to a conference of high

1217
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Checkpeople

1218
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:19,647
They do if they debated whether to kill off Humanity or turn us into a dumb dumbass

1219
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,183
Sucked into video games

1220
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
That is true

1221
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
It's not in the article at all

1222
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,839
It's completely a fabrication of Alex in Spanish

1223
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,167
But his listeners have heard him talk about it so many times

1224
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,215
But it's becoming internalized true

1225
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,031
I've listened to thousands of hours of Alex's show

1226
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,823
In the most I've ever heard him sites

1227
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
From that article is the headline

1228
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,895
Because for his audience

1229
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
That's enough

1230
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,967
He tells the story of what Bill Joyce

1231
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
Supposedly said

1232
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
And then shows the headline

1233
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
The truth of the headlines

1234
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,111
Combined with the story

1235
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,415
And then all you need is that headline in order to

1236
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Approval I

1237
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,487
This is a really important

1238
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,023
Fundamental basis

1239
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,863
Sick trick that allexposed sometimes it's kind of hard to disentangle some of

1240
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
The pieces of it

1241
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
It's a lot like

1242
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,983
If you were

1243
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
Injecting a vaccine with

1244
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
Poison

1245
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Giving it to

1246
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
Interesting way to look at

1247
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,759
So Alex like I said on the 23rd he had a

1248
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:21,855
Big piece that he was promoting we was going to have a special report about Epstein

1249
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,951
Right sure turns out that Alex has decided

1250
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,231
That he has evidence

1251
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,815
That Epstein's operation is still running even though he's dead

1252
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
Those

1253
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
Wow Steve.

1254
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,423
Think so

1255
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,703
It's hard to keep you

1256
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,799
Is convinced that it's

1257
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Still up and running

1258
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,871
And I hear you talk about that

1259
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,175
I mean it's like a bottle commercial

1260
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Are you going tomorrow

1261
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
21 Alive

1262
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Either you pick the one you want

1263
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,831
They look like they're 15 years old

1264
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,879
And that's on YouTube

1265
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
Do you

1266
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,975
You know what's

1267
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
Down the rabbit hole

1268
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,839
We're just supposed to sit there and put up with it

1269
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,775
And then the whole media is covering it up and running whitewashes and attacking us

1270
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,591
All these people have signed on to this

1271
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,383
Fox News

1272
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,759
Signed on child molestation

1273
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,551
That signed on with the Devil

1274
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,927
Debray, tell us your sister again

1275
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,719
You're the reason we're here you're word-of-mouth

1276
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,999
Your Prairie Irvine sport

1277
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,791
We got products you absolutely need

1278
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Blow you away

1279
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
Wow

1280
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
Great

1281
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:41,983
I keep that quick because I want to demonstrate

1282
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,031
Fully and very specifically

1283
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
Using

1284
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,615
22 mark

1285
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,431
This is not something that is necessarily

1286
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:54,783
Well fleshed. Certainly something he's doing a good job

1287
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,807
Interested

1288
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
In the story

1289
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,903
But he's taking these

1290
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,767
The sensationalising things about it because he knows that it's very popular with people on

1291
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,071
He's using it to draw attention to his

1292
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:13,471
Increase engagement

1293
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
About here

1294
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:18,335
He thinks he's cracked the case and discovered that Epstein's operation is still up and running

1295
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,663
Because he just found out about a company called Blue

1296
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:26,271
This is an aviation branding and likes light School

1297
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
Classes operation

1298
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Business

1299
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:34,719
It's run by women named Nadia Ybarra shaneco

1300
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:40,351
I have no idea about the larger picture of her involvement with him nor do I know if a cantaloupe has

1301
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,655
Anything to do with his crimes necessarily

1302
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,495
But I do know that you was a figure was questioned about this matter as far back as

1303
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
Is 20/10

1304
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,079
New ground on the subject

1305
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,871
The aviloop aspect

1306
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,663
The story isn't really vanu either

1307
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,199
Have you published

1308
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
What's an article

1309
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,807
Discusses her weird commercials commercial

1310
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
Conspiratorial

1311
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,583
Kill me for covering this b******* to it

1312
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,679
How to put on a special report there was a little over an hour on Chris

1313
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:19,007
He's just being an interview with the Whistleblower

1314
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,543
Like I would he mention.

1315
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
The 23rd at

1316
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,127
It was a empty cherala Clint Eastwood

1317
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
This

1318
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,175
Metaphorically

1319
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,735
This wasn't a whistleblower

1320
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,039
It was just a guy who done some digging into the eps

1321
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,319
Steve's story from a

1322
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
Conspiratorial

1323
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,391
Insisted on being filled in the shadow

1324
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,023
It's just a guy mumbling through suggestive information but as a loop as if it's breaking news

1325
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,095
A couple times

1326
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,679
Not like that last night

1327
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:55,103
Tell if it's like nervous last strange things on inspire

1328
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:00,991
Also there are multiple commercial breaks in this special report

1329
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:04,831
My point here is that Alex and his shadow on whistleblower

1330
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,647
You're not bringing anything

1331
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,695
Explaining it to create publicity for Alex

1332
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,487
And I find that pretty distaste

1333
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
Not only because

1334
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,327
Cuz I had to watch most of that special report

1335
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,863
Whistleblowers

1336
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Is very annoying

1337
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
It's alright

1338
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
Nonsense

1339
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
Anyway

1340
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:25,823
What are they up to

1341
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
Want to face scan

1342
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,711
Okay that's bad I'm against that sure

1343
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,015
Coming to Las Vegas

1344
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
This year

1345
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:43,231
Which is I don't know how I don't I don't know what to say about that true or not

1346
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
Representing

1347
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
I'll leave that for another day

1348
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
Because Alex

1349
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Get through talking about this story

1350
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Without

1351
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
Veering

1352
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
Into something

1353
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Barry rice

1354
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,983
2019 NFL

1355
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
Starting in Vegas

1356
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,311
Starting in

1357
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,383
Places like that cuz I know you're going to Vegas to have fun

1358
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,943
Until you'll put up whatever they want you to do

1359
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,991
Face scanning

1360
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,903
Illegal aliens in anyways

1361
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:16,255
Illegal aliens are allowed to hit-and-run rob steal kill

1362
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,839
They're just given driver's license in New York

1363
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,399
Another place at LaGuardia labor

1364
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Starting

1365
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,983
JFK LaGuardia

1366
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
Chicago and that was JFK

1367
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:33,663
Wow show all of this is going on all of this is happening

1368
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,735
In your face

1369
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,039
Illegal alien

1370
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,855
Driver's license

1371
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:47,743
A driving test only citizens have left how it would be racist if you're from another country

1372
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,023
Wild

1373
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,839
Let me see the footage of thousands of men

1374
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Wind-up

1375
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,911
To get their driver's license

1376
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,471
You don't even need the test

1377
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:01,567
Just like you can shoot a woman the back and she dies for no reason as long as she's white

1378
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,383
Shooter in the back at the pier

1379
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,407
Who's your dad

1380
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
It's okay

1381
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,967
As long as she quite

1382
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
Yeah

1383
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:16,415
Alex is completely misrepresenting the issue by immigrants getting driver's license

1384
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
Because of course

1385
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:22,559
And of course he's turning it into a narrative it's primarily about how he feels like he's a victim because he's white

1386
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:27,679
Right off the bat it should be pointed out the driver's licenses are given out by the state not by the federal government

1387
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
6th April very a little bit

1388
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:39,455
It's generally true but there might be slight differences state to state

1389
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,551
They're currently 15 states are undocumented immigrants

1390
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,575
Can apply for driver's

1391
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:49,951
And there would likely be more ads that lists

1392
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,791
In most of these cases all that was really done is to

1393
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
Sephora

1394
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,655
Application to be substituted for the regularly required Social Security card

1395
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,191
Is a form of

1396
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:00,959
Be given to drivers

1397
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:08,639
I did not know I don't know what the breakdown is on the state-by-state but from everything I can tell this works exactly

1398
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,455
The same as if you

1399
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,759
Just was slightly different document required

1400
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Right

1401
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
You would still have to take the written

1402
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
For sure

1403
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,951
The driving test do you have to kill

1404
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:28,095
I know that in some states you don't have to retake the driving portion of the test if you're applying for a license in your old one hasn't

1405
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,655
Or if it just recently expired

1406
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:35,007
I assume there may be some states that allow that in these cases to

1407
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:39,615
Like if you have a current driver's license for Mexico let's say you might not have to retake the driving

1408
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
Portion

1409
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
Maybe

1410
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,223
But I feel like circumstances like that aren't the norm

1411
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,503
You still have to take the

1412
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:49,087
What are the main arguments surrounding these measures

1413
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,367
In favor of it is this

1414
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:55,231
Some research has indicated that licensing immigrants were previously unauthorized safety

1415
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
Obvious reason is that they're required to pass the test

1416
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,375
Yes that usually yeah

1417
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
Just pretending

1418
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
He's just making that

1419
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,495
Another reason that is important is

1420
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,567
They can get car insurance

1421
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,383
Which makes things way safer for everyone

1422
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:16,223
Most of the metrics you really want to focus on

1423
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
Insist on documented immigrant

1424
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,831
State revenues increase overall safety improve

1425
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,623
Able to pursue work

1426
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,671
Opportunities more easily than connected

1427
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
The only real way to be against this is if you really want undocumented immigrants to be miserable and ultimately gone

1428
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
What's going on

1429
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,751
Beginning this episode Alex was mad at Trump

1430
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
Yes

1431
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
He's

1432
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Here's the thing

1433
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
You meant for that to be a

1434
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,151
Clean take

1435
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,455
So he could post a video with a

1436
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,807
Flashy headline to try and get Trump's attention but he got sidetracked

1437
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,903
Replaying about Epstein style thing

1438
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:02,815
You think it's them up with a very simple headlight

1439
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
But

1440
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,607
Fear not

1441
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,887
Editor

1442
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,471
He discusses how they should edit this video

1443
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:14,079
Rodger Stone information

1444
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615

Alex Jones

1451
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
Blows up at Trump

1452
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,119
Did I know those have a messages

1453
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:37,887
To the president

1454
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:43,519
Why isn't the president standing up for himself and others

1455
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
President Trump's greatest failing

1456
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,127
Message from Alex Jones

1457
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,431
President Trump please stop failing us

1458
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
Help us

1459
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
Gobus

1460
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,343
We're good Americans are under attack do your job dependents

1461
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,647
Trump Lilly title that video

1462
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
We'll figure it out

1463
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,487
Why right now and

1464
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,023
Forget that video

1465
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:10,655
I'm supposed to send it to the campaign and the White House and then

1466
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,935
Did the Secret Service

1467
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,007
Send it to the Secret Service

1468
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
Alex fields

1469
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
Desperate

1470
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,079
Yeah

1471
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
As bad

1472
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,383
I need Trump

1473
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
Detention

1474
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:27,039
We have to make a headline that sounds combative

1475
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
It does seem like Trump likes to fight with people

1476
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
If I say something he gets messages like

1477
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,023
Yeah yeah

1478
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,119
The title

1479
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Instead

1480
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,959
Really freaks out about

1481
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Accu

1482
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:49,055
And I think one of the reasons they get around this

1483
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,591
The 27th there was

1484
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,615
The number of

1485
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Queue account

1486
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
Trump was retweeted

01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,271

And you know I thought all the gas we had

1492
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,639

Creed the boxing punch the present

1494
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
We didn't influence Stephen Miller

1495
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
No

1496
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:35,647
My mother didn't give birth to me you did my father and skills

1497
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,439
Who is God

1498
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Curious

1505
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,047
2 weeks

1506
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,215
Call Edwards

1507
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,007
So far so I want

1508
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,799
Talk about all that too

1509
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,847
President's press conference

1510
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,127
Alex is soap

1511
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
F****** jealous of

1512
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Twitter bot

1513
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
Anella

1514
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,343
Does he understand man

1515
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,159
Also doesn't it there is a bit of a personal

1516
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,975
I do feel like he was convinced MyQ for a while

1517
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,791
BMX

1518
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:51,167
I was hoping for you I wanted them.

1519
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,983
Necessarily think that's

1520
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,031
My sensors

1521
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,591
In the feeling is more like

1522
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,871
What I could have done

1523
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:05,247
Yeah it's almost there

1524
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,927
Wish I would have worked out a little bit of it,

1525
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,207
I was in AAA

1526
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,255
I was in AAA in a venti

1527
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:22,655
Promoted one guy to the show and he wasn't as good as me and that's why I honestly also feel like

1528
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
That

1529
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,007
It's it's the same sort of thing is like

1530
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,311
If only he'd listen to like Max

1531
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,871
Kyser way back when he was telling him to get into Bitcoin

1532
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:37,759
If you would have just gotten in the right way

1533
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
You probably could

1534
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
Made a killing

1535
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,855
And I think there was that

1536
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,647
Missed opportunity

1537
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,207
The opposite of buyer's remorse

1538
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,767
It probably feels

1539
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,791
All of these accounts

1540
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:56,447
All over Twitter with huge massive audiences

1541
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,983
He's got to be furious

1542
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,287
We live in a weird world

1543
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
Where the president

1544
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
Is basically a chain email

1545
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
May I come to life

1546
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,199
Man want to talk about that a little bit later

1547
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,479
Crazy do not play

1548
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,807
So I need to send

1549
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,135
It's that for headlines to get to

1550
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
So we got to get to the news

1551
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,487
Conservative Publications is telling people

1552
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,511
Encourage your wife

1553
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
I have sex with other man in front of you

1554
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,839
Encourage

1555
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
Relationship

1556
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,191
Literally

1557
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:38,431
You don't want me anymore

1558
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,551
Literally I got stacks of that new to Redbox today weather

1559
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
The family show

1560
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:49,951
Wow this is

1561
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,487
Yeah man

1562
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:56,095
Tell your wife to arrive

1563
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
I mean

1564
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,495
I don't know what conservative publication

1565
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:06,847
Swinging

1566
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,151
Is manly

1567
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:09,919
You better about this

1568
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:14,015
Not in front of you

1569
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,159
Never do that

1570
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
Keys in the bowl

1571
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
But not while he's watch

1572
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:30,399
Exposition

1573
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
The need

1574
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
To cover that butt

1575
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
When he gets back

1576
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
From break

1577
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Down to business

1578
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,871
To do his video that he's going to direct

1579
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,455
It's basically just like the same thing he's already

1580
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:47,295
I'm saying

1581
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:53,695
What criminal keep doing what they're doing

1582
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,815
But you didn't lock him up you let him go organized again and try to rob the bank again

1583
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,399
Us

1584
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,191
Paulie scams

1585
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,775
Roughshod over conservatives and Christians

1586
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,311
Bully everybody

1587
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,919
I'm not going to sit here

1588
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,295
Lead action press

1589
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
Centrum

1590
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
Number of

1591
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
I want to get your take on what

1592
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
Probably to do with the new year

1593
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,743
That's really sad to me is that he's absolutely

1594
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,839
Absolutely everything that I've seen it

1595
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:36,191
He says though

1596
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,983
Make a stand

1597
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
Is it always just

1598
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Talk

1599
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,687
I don't know if it's

1600
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
It's infuriating

1601
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
To watch so many of these guys

1602
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:56,159
Alex and and just come so dangerously close to realizing that they've been scam

1603
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,207
That they've been Griffin

1604
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,743
They don't

1605
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,071
They just can't cross that line he's so close

1606
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,351
To realizing what

1607
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,911
Everybody 25th

1608
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
What

1609
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:11,007
What are you doing

1610
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
Trump with Griff

1611
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,848
He's a liar

1612
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,152
To make his own money

1613
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
It's really tough to tell

1614
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,760
When you're on this ride when do you

1615
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,296
When do you sell

1616
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:27,648
Bitcoin avoid the downside

1617
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:32,000
Trying to figure out what that is

1618
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,048
And it's constantly not yet

1619
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:38,912
Reviews on that line I think he does know that eventually

1620
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
It's got it at

1621
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,824
It's not going to work out

1622
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,688
I think I'm at evenwood through job are not happen

1623
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,224
Clearly

1624
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:57,856
They think he's trying to say Victory from the jaws of defeat as it were

1625
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,672
We're like trying to get something out of it

1626
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,744
Maybe I get back on Facebook

1627
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,072
Roblox up Hillary

1628
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,144
I can't out that none of this is because right now

1629
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,424
It feels like all of this

1630
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,704
Has been a massive waste

1631
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:18,336
Convince

1632
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
Stop

1633
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,432
I think he's trying to acclimate a little bit

1634
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:28,064
Almost that Trump is going to disappoint

1635
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,648
So you talk about that

1636
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,440
Trump World still needs

1637
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
Me

1638
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,048
Imma go to break I'll get to the Press, just makes me so mad I could think about it

1639
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:44,192
Cuz if you leave Rodger Stone out to dry leave anybody that's right I believe you do the right thing

1640
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,752
Look what's happened to Assange

1641
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
We got Trump elect

1642
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
Okay

1643
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:53,408
He needs to protect the Republican American people it's his job plus

1644
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
We

1645
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,480
Went through hell to get him in there you did

1646
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,040
We put Trump in there

1647
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,320
He just one waving his fight

1648
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,088
We're getting

1649
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:05,952
Global kicked out everywhere we're having surgeries on planetary scale kit critical operation stay on here

1650
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,024
The Cavalry from Trump is never going to

1651
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
Start thinking

1652
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,864
The Cavalry incoming where the cavalry

1653
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,888
And you're the cavalry

1654
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,728
Do standwithus ladies and gentlemen do your shopping and infowarsstore.com

1655

Frontline's at

1657
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,504
Ww.w.

1658
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Sometimes

1659
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
The sales are funny

1660
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,184
Sometimes it is like boring like yeah gif

1661
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,976
The krill oil or whatever

1662
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Whatever

1663
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
Sometimes there

1664
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,560
And we were blessed

1665
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,608
On this December 27th episode

1666
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:48,704
Was one of the funnier moments that I've ever heard

1667
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,776
We have the very best supplements the very best books

1668
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,544

A lot of really great

1670
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
Patriot apparel

1671
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,176
T-shirts so they're okay

1672
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:06,112
Apparently some pictures are the best infowars.com

1673
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:10,720
Or 888-253-3139

1674
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,536
I got the new don't visiting for sure I love that

1675
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,096
Black Panther

1676
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,192
Kill yourself shirt is a piece of History

1677
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,008
Dcec monetizing

1678
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,056
Stop really aggressively

1679
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:31,712
But I love I love the idea that he's like

1680
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:38,880
Get some don't get subs

1681
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:45,280
Humility yeah it is a very strange place

1682
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,680
He's always the best in everything but I think he's blaming the shirt people

1683
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
You know the manufacturers who make the actual shirts

1684
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,848
All right I got to check p.m.

1685
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,200
Tickled

1686
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,272
That is such a weird place for the

1687
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,832
Come back after the break

1688
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
He's talking about

1689
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,208
Earlier he said that he was trying to brainstorm

1690
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,256
Two name

1691
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,536
Detention

1692
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,376
And I think he realizes that whenever he gets mad

1693
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
Trump

1694
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,168
He gets drunk

1695
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
The temperature whenever he lashes out

1696
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
He gets the attention

1697
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,776
Explicitly says

1698
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
And I'm just telling listeners

1699
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,104
The White House listen to you

1700
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,480
Everytime I get mad at Trump he pooped out to enforce videos

1701
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,320
Okay great thank you mr. president

1702
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,112
Because I want to get those videos

1703
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
And defeat

1704
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
What show solidarity

1705
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,976
We appreciate

1706
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,256
That's great mr. press

1707
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,072
Dashiki stuff every week

1708
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,864
The media doesn't even attack

1709
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,144
I don't know what to do

1710
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
What to do

1711
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,960
He's not doing that's wonderful

1712
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,568
I want to see indictments

1713
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
McCabe

1714
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
Call me

1715
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:05,920
Hillary

1716
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
Let's start with frock

1717
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,992
But start with Paige

1718
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,784
Let's start with or

1719
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,112
Let's start let's start let's start let's start let's start

1720
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:18,976
I haven't really looked at Trump's Twitter account in quite a while

1721
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,280
See if he tweeted out any of Alex's stuff lately

1722
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,560
Holy Ship

1723
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,328
What a mistake

1724
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:28,448
Twitter feed is just drowning in stupid memes and retweets of obviously fake account

1725
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:33,056
This would be really upsetting as a feed like if you decide from anyone

1726
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
Let alone

1727
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
The president

1728
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
It was not a fun clip

1729
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:42,272
As well as pretty much most of social media

1730
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
Disaster area

1731
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,880
But it's my journalistic duty to at least scratch the surface of these thing

1732
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,160
Went back to

1733
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:52,256
To see if Trump really did push Alex's stuff after Alex got mad

1734
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:53,792
I figured that

1735
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,584
The time

1736
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
Treason

1737
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,680
Recent example of that

1738
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,472
December 4th

1739
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:05,312
If Alex's promises correct and you'd expect to see some info

1740
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:09,920
I did see two tweets where Trump was retweeting the Trump organization

1741
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,480
Promotional tweets

1742
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:15,808
For the 2019 season

1743
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,880
Be there in 2 weeks the southern

1744
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,928
!

1745
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:26,560
Totally constitutionally okay thing to do

1746
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,936
I also sought a tweet.

1747
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:35,520
On my way to Hershey Pennsylvania for a rally see you soon

1748
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,312
I love Hershey's chocolate

1749
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Really

1750
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,384
Like a child I can't

1751
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:47,040
I can't do it can you imagine if we had a break-in in 86

1752
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,064
We're able to tweet

1753
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,368
Bananas

1754
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,952
Like the the mushy brain of these two guys

1755
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,024
Hershey chocolate

1756
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,888
Christ you're plenty of retweets of Breitbart

1757
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:07,776
Which I didn't know existed podcast podcast

1758
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,224
Information.

1759
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:20,320
I think Alex just perceive the Trump throws them a bone whenever he starts getting mad

1760
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
I don't know if that's

1761
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
True

1762
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,392
Stretch

1763
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,232
I think that's the illusion that he likes to live in

1764
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:33,376
Whenever I get out of line Trump gives me a sign

1765
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,656
True

1766
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:37,984
The squeaky wheel gets the oil kind of dehydration

1767
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,264
And now the show gets

1768
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
Weird

1769
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,056
Now

1770
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,664
3 years of our show or

1771
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,968
This episode takes a turn

1772
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,784
I don't know what prompted him to save it

1773
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,576
I got really excited when he did

1774
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,184
Richard Reeves is in here at the bottom of the next hour

1775
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:00,256
My nose I'm bad about doing stuff I say I'll do on everything

1776
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,024
Get busy and forget

1777
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,816
They're going to put on screen over here

1778
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,608
Dodge dealership

1779
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,144
I'm going to tell you

1780
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,936
The big secret of the New World Order

1781
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:15,616
The big enchilada

1782
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:19,968
The real deal

1783
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:22,784
The factions are

1784
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,136
Decision you gotta make you want to have a happy happy stuff

1785
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:31,232
You going to get it today I told you no more games like still much

1786
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:33,536
Everything everything's going to come out

1787
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:37,120
No more games

1788
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,400
I swear

1789
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:42,496
He said that directly to you and he is not to deliver

1790
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,824
With you I swear to God

1791
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,896
Did I swear to you right now but anyway

1792
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,528
You know he's not going to deliver

1793
01:28:55,552 --> 01:29:01,696
Don't do the words almost word-for-word

1794
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,488
Exact

1795
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:09,376
Tell you what you're saying not that he's f****** with your clothes so that would be silly

1796
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,424
But I did hear that message

1797
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,240
There's no way I can

1798
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,104
Let me put your reminder.

1799
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,128
Does

1800
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,152
Okay

1801
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,176
But it's

1802
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,712
Forced

1803
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,248
Brief

1804
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,528
Probably

1805
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:32,928
One of the most insane things I've ever heard him say I like it

1806
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,256
2017 steel Megyn Kelly

1807
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,048
Dude

1808
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:45,728
There could not be a more invalidating thing for Alex to say is the heart of the New World Order

1809
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,008
Pixie

1810
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,456
Episode

1811
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,088
About nothing for awhile

1812
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,160
Mostly I mean

1813
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,976
Mafia goes and harasses say

1814
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,048
All the cleaners in a certain part of a city

1815
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,352
If you don't pass protection money

1816
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,376
Something bad's going to

1817
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,144
Happened to your

1818
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,168
They're picking up

1819
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:15,936
Laundry

1820
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,800
And then when they don't somebody firebombed the laundry

1821
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,080
Or the grocery store

1822
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,896
The FBI goes and they arrest

1823
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:29,248
The members of the mafia that came in and threatened the store.

1824
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,832
So this is my to be like I do got arrested

1825
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,368
You got to rest all of these people

1826
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:40,256
Clyde Mafia like that never took off and places like that

1827
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Texas

1828
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,304
Because if you walked in

1829
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,584
Dry cleaners

1830
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,376
Texas with a Texan on it

1831
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
You said

1832
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:51,264
You're going to give us money or something bad's going to happen to your business you would be killed right there

1833
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
Yubikey

1834
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,200
Did you came into their business

1835
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:03,296
And said we want money we're going to kill you they pull a gun out and shoot you

1836
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,880
I kill you just like that

1837
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,952
People that I grew up around the last group of Texas wood

1838
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,720
Kill you

1839
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,768
Just like that question of it

1840
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,048
If you mess with them

1841
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,864
Olivas Mexican Mafia

1842
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,424
Stuff here because that's not what I was

1843
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,728
Alex is full of

1844
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,592
Denton Texas

1845
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,152
Dallas crime family

1846
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,688
Coincidentally because

1847
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:35,040
Alex grew up in Dallas so

1848
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:41,440
When this is all over operation was up and running to saying is true

1849
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
The Texan

1850
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:47,584
His ego is so wrapped up in his legendary character that seems impossible to him

1851
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,888
Did any Texan will be shaken down by a criminal

1852
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,168
Let's just as feelings

1853
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,240
He's talking about makes no sense

1854
01:31:54,496 --> 01:32:00,640
Shouldn't he know that there was bumpy and Texas based on his JFK conspiracies about Jack Ruby

1855
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,176
Gymkhana Joseph

1856
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:06,016
Don't even worry about it

1857
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,832
How could you not

1858
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:14,976
The myth is the cowboy

1859
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,512
And in the Wild West

1860
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:23,424
No one was afraid of criminals criminals definitely didn't go from town to town

1861
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,216
Because everybody there was a tie

1862
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,264
Everybody's fired on

1863
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,568
For no reason

1864
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,152
Open for a bit

1865
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,944
Gibbstown

1866
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,480
Do saying something pretty shocked

1867
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,528
Is that

1868
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
Doesn't

1869
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,320
Purge the

1870
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
Abyss anime

1871
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,392
Trump's got to go

1872
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,952
Okay and also this clip involves

1873
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,232
Wannabe longer pauses

1874
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,792

Fair warning

1876
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,608
A very long.

1877
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,656
Trump and Republicans

1878
01:32:54,912 --> 01:33:00,800
Are going to go to war with the Deep State and they're going to remove these devil worshiping stomp for Trump needs to be removed

1879
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,360

1880
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,944
And we need to get somebody in there

1881
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,736
It'll do something about all this

1882
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,760
Because I'm done

1883
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,816
Free number to join us

1885
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,168
13 second pause

1886
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,264
Realizes

1887
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,568
The government will get somebody well

1888
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,360
Yeesh I have always been

1889
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,408
That was supposed to be

1890
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:40,992
Edit it out and put to put in that video

1891
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,528
Hey.

1892
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:47,136
Might be the reason for that

1893
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,464
Eatzi's has a little bit more about it and like

1894
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
You pissed off either

1895
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:55,328
Enemies out of government

1896
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,376
But he's also wants to make sure they do

1897
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,912
I still support

1898
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,216
These people

1899
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:01,984
So stupid

1900
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,520
The president

1901
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,312
I pray for justice and I support the president

1902
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,872
I support him

1903
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,688
In this campaign for another 311 days

1904
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,992
But man

1905
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,272
Am I going to feel suckered

1906
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,856
He gets in the office again in these people are

1907
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,648
I'll get in trouble

1908
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,184
They are going to kill sucker

1909
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,000
You sure this is the same thing you said

1910
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,328
Is the real deal has been tricked

1911
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:33,728
But I'm going to feel sucker doesn't solve our globalist

1912
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,288
Crisis immediately ask her it's

1913
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
Stop it

1914
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,872
Oh man-seok

1915
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,640
The place

1916
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,968
Really the reason Alex can't let go

1917
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,504
Is because

1918
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,040
Like

1919
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,344
Trump only won because of him

1920
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
Everybody

1921
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,904
Within Trump

1922
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,696
Orbit during the campaign

1923
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
Was just

1924
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
Ripping off Ally

1925
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,280
Alex is

1926
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
Basically the present

1927
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,888
Really think about it I really do think

1928
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,728
There's a lot of Demands we need to make of our president

1929
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,032
We're not the cult here we put him there

1930
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,080
He adopted the Nationalist

1931
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:13,152
Patriot movement as an operating system to counter the globalist

1932
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,968
Because the Pentagon came to him

1933
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:19,296
He called the operating system America's always had

1934
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,344
Jones's popularized it

1935
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:25,952
We've we've written it into a codified plan this evening the New York Times They attacked

1936
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,232
Steve Miller

1937
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:35,936
Got adopted by Bannon man I didn't come up with all this

1938
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,752
Is a movie screenplay writer

1939
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,824
Okay they wrote a screenplay off this show

1940
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,896
Total left so pissed they got all the phones tapped they know

1941
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
I know the White House still listens

1942
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,456
Everyday

1943
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
Okay

1944
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:55,136
I'm not a screenwriter I'm Alex Jones from Texas for real for real

1945
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,952
I just I don't even

1946
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,512
I don't even believe that you believe that I know

1947
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,816
That doesn't sound sincere

1948
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:06,912
But you saying you mean this I don't think you mean that

1949
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:13,568
But I do think he means it's even better sounds a lot like a

1950
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,640
Great

1951
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,176
I just feel so much

1952
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:18,944
Anger

1953
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
Bactrim

1954
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:23,296
Yeah why does it is petty reception

1955
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:28,416
Seems to be like you're not paying attention to me you're not doing what I want you to do

1956
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:34,048
I'm going to lash out I'm going to start talking about how it was only me that led to you getting where you are now

1957
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:37,376
You are everything to me and now you're not taking care of me

1958
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:39,936
Sad

1959
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
In this next clip

1960
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:47,360
Early did you know that billares leads antifa

1961
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,664
I did not know that

1962
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:55,040
Nowell we saw him just recently at the Chicago teachers strike he was not leading into

1963
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,904
And I didn't realize

1964
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,976
Stop all civil unrest

1965
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
This country

1966
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
Is

1967
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,560
Bust some antifa leaders

1968
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,120
Right because find their contract

1969
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
It's like the one he found on

1970
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
Fortune

1971
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,704
It all the way up

1972
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:17,056
I refuse to believe that he so dumb

1973
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,592
The feds

1974
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:22,944
Gobus any local antifa leader they're led by the weathermen

1975
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:26,016
In Berkeley they're led by famous professors in the weathermen

1976
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,040
It's the weatherman

1977
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,856
That means.

1978
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:35,488
Officers and everything

1979
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,072
Let me go on our methods and idiots don't know what they're doing

1980
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,168
Organized crime racketeering ladies and gentlemen

1981
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:51,104
You didn't always off-limits if you don't got them they persecute you they ban you want the proud boys or Imports

1982
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,664
Because they're decoys

1983
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,944
Stage makeup

1984
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:05,184
And soros's Son runs if we got the secret documents BFDI confirm they're real

1985
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
No it didn't

1986
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:12,096
Planning to violate citizens civil rights to keep people from having her speech trigger race riots

1987
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,912
Target local government Police Department

1988
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:18,240
Overthrow city government install

1989
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:22,336
Globalist over cities in blue cities are under their total control

1990
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,360
And some red City

1991
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,896
This is

1992
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,920
So disconnected

1993
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:34,112
Man contracts

1994
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,648
Confirm a lot of stuff

1995
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,184
It is

1996
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
This dumb

1997
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,000
Really wants those contracts

1998
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,536
To be real

1999
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,304
Text that they are

2000
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,120
They go against

2001
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:45,888
Every

2002
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,168
Possible

2003
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,704
Reality

2004
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,520
Motivation that any actor is the

2005
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,800
Situation would have

2006
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:55,104
Contradicted

2007
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,688
The only people who would

2008
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:01,504
Ever consider making those documents

2009
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,296
Are out are you

2010
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:10,720
But he needs them to be real because they are proof that Alexander Soros is basically running a terror

2011
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
First organization

2012
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,560
And that as he's talking about it that leads him to

2013
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,584
I'm going to save this

2014
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,912
I don't think

2015
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,192
People to kill

2016
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Soros fam

2017
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,520
Sure I do think it's debatable

2018
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,056
Whether or not that's a message

2019
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:27,360
You could take from this clip that's not a good

2020
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,920
And neither is this

2021
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:34,016
Do you understand. You can't leave Soros and the globalist

2022
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:37,344
Going around the

2023
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,880
Villages

2024
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,328
So they need to know

2025
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,376
We know what to hit

2026
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,680
Do you think they want us off the are we

2027
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:58,080
Have the Death Star plans to use that allegory

2028
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
Man

2029
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:10,368
Put a devil worshipping Aleister Crowley pedophile I'm not going to sit here and let these people run my life

2030
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,160
What about you

2031
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,208
About you people

2032
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,048
Real I think that's a potential reading of it is

2033
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
Is normal tone

2034
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
Starting what you can't allow people like Soros

2035
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:26,496
Wandering around on the streets

2036
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:35,456
Tulsa Lake

2037
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:37,504
I think you could take that

2038
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,320
Context clues

2039
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
To do to

2040
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,648
Satanic demon pedophile

2041
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,672
You know you could

2042
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
You could make

2043
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,464
Pretty strong case

2044
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:49,536
Pretty

2045
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:53,888
F***** up I mean

2046
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,168
I do believe

2047
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,192
The townsfolk

2048
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,264
Upon being confronted with Frankenstein's monster

2049
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,336
Decided to hold a free and fair trial

2050
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:06,944
Let him out on bail make sure that everything was process

2051
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,784
Yeah they were really into that if I recall correctly that's how they wanted

2052
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,320
Yeah I'm intuitive Oaks

2053
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,624
Violence

2054
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,904
These people

2055
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,184
It's just not good

2056
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,488
Good going on

2057
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
Jesus

2058
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,816
Tradition in our modern

2059
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,840
Episodes

2060
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,120
This is much more

2061
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,144
Regular

2062
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,984
States on that topic

2063
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,264
Too long cuz he's got to get back

2064
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,848
Petty grievances

2065
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,872
Temporarily

2066
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:36,896
The weather

2067
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,200
I'm not backing down

2068
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,992
Whenever

2069
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
Grandmother you know what thing everybody was turned on Trump

2070
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,464
I said it's all boats out of context locker room talk

2071
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,536
Everybody cuz you're the one

2072
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,816
You're the one

2073
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:58,656
Little Talks

2074
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
Contacts

2075
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,056
Do you have the Mossad assassinated

2076
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:10,176
He's not racist

2077
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,224
W3

2078
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:24,256
They were trying to panic everything right there to get folks to turn on front right at that moment

2079
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:30,656
I think it's hilarious

2080
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,448
That is a

2081
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,728
Big swing

2082
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:40,128
That's all Ludacris purse is

2083
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,432
I started

2084
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:50,624
The funny thing is Alex's take on the n-word tape

2085
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,440
Because if you recall

2086
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,208
Capybara

2087
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,768
Was someone trolled Paul Joseph Watson

2088
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,816
By sending him a Twitter direct

2089
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:01,120
Message

2090
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,752
MBC

2091
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,544
A copy of the

2092
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,104
Or had seen it and the media was going to run with it

2093
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,384
Disgaea

2094
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,664
F****** with Paul

2095
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:16,480
Deliver this message to Ali

2096
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:20,576
And in January 2017

2097
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,112
And recorded

2098
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:28,000
Probably on a plane you can hear people in the background but it was such an emergency for him

2099
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,048
That he needed to get ahead of the story

2100
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:33,120
We are now about three and a half days house

2101
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,424
Event taking place

2102
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,216

Anyone might be under open

2107
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,160
Take compilation

2108
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,744
Whatever

2109
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,280
The Apprentice

2110
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,072
With him sitting in the chair

2111
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,400
Things like it sounds retarded and

2112
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,936
Shelves

2113
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,240
And supposedly the n-word

2114
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,104
A long time

2115
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,640
Does white

2116
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:20,736
Basically tell dirty jokes getting tingly comedian would do

2117
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,296
Austin

2118
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,320
Almost

2119
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,088
Believer

2120
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,136
Break the ice

2121
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:39,936
Portraying at the house

2122
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,240
Started Locker otaka graduation

2123
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,264
II

2124
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,104
I refuse to believe that a human being exists who doesn't

2125
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:50,432
Look I don't care if there's a tape or not if you think that

2126
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,968
Trump doesn't say the Edward

2127
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,016
You're insane

2128
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:59,904
Crazy if you look at the decisions he's made about like renting his Apartments Central Park

2129
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,440
I think you'd be

2130
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,464
YouTube

2131
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,256
Beyond credulity

2132
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,352
Plenty of people believe that and support him for it

2133
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:11,680
I think you are a Beyond ridiculous

2134
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,448
If you don't think

2135
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,496
I mean that's just silly

2136
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:19,360
Alex just silly

2137
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:23,456
On Twitter was to say that he looks credible

2138
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,504
And then do damage

2139
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,832
Because obviously he would do that

2140
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:31,904
Control for the inevitable release of the tape

2141
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,928
Thinks he's coming

2142
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,464
He's not

2143
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,768
It's not real

2144
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,096
Alex Goes to call

2145
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,168
And this first caller is

2146
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,448
Upset

2147
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,264
I think Trump needs to call out the Marines

2148
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:52,128
I think he needs to arrest people they need to be tried for treason

2149
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:58,528
We all hate the police States the police state is what the less doing lawlessly using the apparatus against American people

2150
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:02,880
Election

2151
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:07,232
What you do they let us to this point it's the default position

2152
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:13,888
I need to be arrested they need to be cleaned up and the American people will support it

2153
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,216
Yes I will there be behind him 100%

2154
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:20,800
1 Seasons crossed safely his second term Alex

2155
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,504
He needs a third term

2156
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:34,368
He wants or needs a third term we need to add mediately after getting a second

2157
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:37,696
Well that would certainly draw them in a conniption fit

2158
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:43,840
You see a little bit almost exasperation from Alex after this guy was like he needs a third term

2159
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,888
I think that's a little bit too much for Alex

2160
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:49,728
Calling out the military cleaning out his enemies

2161
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,520
Alberto double-down on that

2162
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,800
Yes absolutely

2163
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,336
Also he needs a third term

2164
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,872
That would freak out the laugh

2165
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,640
God

2166
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,176
Stupid hats

2167
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,456
They just

2168
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:06,112
Also never read a history book also that implies that this caller thinks that situation

2169
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,136
The equivalent

2170
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,416
After World War II

2171
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
Exactly

2172
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,000
This is what's great

2173
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:16,096
About this imaginary war with these imaginary enemies

2174
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:18,144
It never will be done

2175
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:24,032
The premises we can rationalize keeping him in office as long as this war is on

2176
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,312
Use back door to dict

2177
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,920
Damn right you telling me no s***

2178
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:30,944
Every

2179
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,248
How do they how does it

2180
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,016
Still happy

2181
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,880
The idea that you would trust

2182
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:45,792
The guy who's currently in government break

2183
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,096
Reason to get rid of their enemies

2184
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,120
Even if

2185
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,192
Even if it's real

2186
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:58,592
Always use to turn everybody into a dictate that I would tell you that ten years ago

2187
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,920
Years ago

2188
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:05,248
And they still do it they still cry for it

2189
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:07,040
These people are insane

2190
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,856
Tried

2191
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,392
It's best you can to get

2192
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:14,208
Trump's attention on this episode he's threatened

2193
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:19,584
Steven title on one of his videos

2194
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,376
Maybe I'm out

2195
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:25,216
After you get reelected

2196
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:29,312
No I think he's just sending to implied threats

2197
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,848
I want Rodger Stone

2198
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,872

Jellicles and others it's not like Trump gay or something but

2207
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:58,240
For not being a gun

2208

Rogers just well-known okay

2209
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:03,104
His wingman

Handrblock

Not good

2219
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:36,384
Garlic sticks another caller guess what this one's upsetting to

2220
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,184
Young lady

2221
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:55,840
We're done sitting here on our hands

2222
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,632
We're done we're done with the talk

2223
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:14,272
Millions and billions

2224
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:35,008
There Will Be Blood

2225
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,616
OKC

2226
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,176
I would say

2227
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:44,480
Play past the point of where people

2228
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,296
You don't have a right to take

2229
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:49,088
The problem is they set it up

2230
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,672
That's why

2231
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,952
It's critical

2232
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:58,560
Put that violence in the action politically

2233
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:07,008
Just imagine how much energy you can spend waking people up letting Trump know that you want action

2234
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,568
Had to use that type of energy

2235
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,360
Innn win

2236
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
Offensive op

2237
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,784
False flag us

2238
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:23,136
Obviously we never Target innocent people to Walmart obviously wouldn't get Target the police

2239
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:30,560
It's people like Nancy Pelosi son people like Hunter Biden all these Criminal

2240
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,120
Bubble off some of their nose at us

2241
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:39,520
Why are they the ones

2242
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:45,920
Staged

2243
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:52,320
But go to a trump rally peacefully

2244
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:58,720
Just wait till he pauses and then say Rodger Stone infowars.com

2245
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:05,120
Know your friendly they'll agree with you and then

2246
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:09,728
Message to everybody

2247
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,520
Holyshit

2248
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,056
I'm happy

2249
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,592
Alex didn't offer him a job

2250
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,360
Quite frankly

2251
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,712
Tired

2252
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:28,160
When you create a really highly intense and then give

2253
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,184
Citations

2254
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:35,328
Hey the thing that you were really angry about is going to come in this guy is going to deliver it when you know full well that then.

2255
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:43,264
Any other Outlet other than this anger

2256
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,568
Expression

2257
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,592
Is manifest

2258
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,664
It's The Logical endpoint of a certain amount of people

2259
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,712
Who gets sucked into things like Q

2260
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,272
Gyro Express

2261
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,160
Alex's response to that isn't so much

2262
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,184
No

2263
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,208
Hey

2264
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,232
They deserve it

2265
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,560
Of course they do way past the point of deserving it

2266
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:12,960
It'll make us look bad if you do hate those people first things that didn't

2267
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:18,080
Happened

2268
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,408
You respond whole thing to say

2269
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:23,200
Context

2270
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,760
And then it leads to pay Duffy's Island

2271
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:30,368
Give me free press, make everything better

2272
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,952
This is really bad it's really really bad

2273
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:35,232
That is that is

2274
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:39,840
Like if you have people up into that much of a friend in public

2275
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:42,400
Saying that to all of his fans

2276
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:43,936
They would have

2277
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,216
A round

2278
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,264
There is no

2279
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,824
And then go

2280
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,616
And no

2281
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:54,432
You guys are acting all crazy

2282
01:53:54,688 --> 01:54:00,832
I need to focus on you put up signs of my show

2283
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,720
We just need to

2284
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:09,024
Put up sign saying no more witches here

2285
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,328
It's absurd

2286
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,120
Do you see that

2287
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:13,888
That's what I

2288
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,656
What's keeps

2289
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:19,008
He's trying to transmute this violent anger that is the natural

2290
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,288
The disappointment

2291
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,568
These

2292
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,640
Aspiring authoritarian followers

2293
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:29,504
How can I monetize

2294
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,272
Is this

2295
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:34,368
Instead of recognizing it as a really dangerous sign about what

2296
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,648
Community

2297
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,928
B he

2298
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,976
Speaks to his wife

2299
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:42,560
Create very high percentage of these callers are

2300
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,584
Deeply disturbing

2301
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
Prank calls

2302
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
And

2303
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:48,192
I've never found his calls to be

2304
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,472
Great

2305
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:54,336
4 healthy number of them lately has been along these lines

2306
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,128
Sky and it's not

2307
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,432
It's not something that you should take lightly

2308
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,712
Orbi

2309
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,296
You should feel respond

2310
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,856
No it feels like

2311
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,136
For the past

2312
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,160
Wife

2313
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:09,696
13 years

2314
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,512
The right-wing media machine has been

2315
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,536
Edging

2316
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,656
18 to 35 year old men with white match guns

2317
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:23,264
With all these guns and then just never let giving them that released

2318
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:26,080
And now it's really coming to the Boyd of a boil

2319
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,872
Yeah like so many of these guys

2320
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,432
You've told me that there's Tyron

2321
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,992
Gif

2322
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:36,576
Where do I kill people

2323
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:37,600
It kill

2324
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:38,880
I find that to be upsetting

2325
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:41,952
And I think Alex is in a situation where

2326
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:44,512
He has a responsibility to

2327
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
Deal with it

2328
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,560
Settings not

2329
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:47,584
Betty White

2330
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,352
We'11

2331
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,144
Because I was promised

2332
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:50,912
Esther reveal

2333
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:51,680
The big secret

2334
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:54,496
Of the Illuminati

2335
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
So here's the thing

2336
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,056
He is Richard Reeves

2337
01:55:57,312 --> 01:56:00,128
Richard Reeves I don't know he's a friend of his

2338
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:02,176
Being back in the system

2339
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:05,504
He's credited as a reporter I don't know if he is

2340
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:10,112
You was just somebody who Infowars head out it like Trump rallies back in 2016

2341
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,928
He doesn't come up much I don't I don't know

2342
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,464
Marcus Theaters

2343
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:19,328
Trump supporter

2344
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,352
He keeps wanting

2345
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:26,496
But in but Alex is like what you want later

2346
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,080

2347

Text Steve

2348
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:33,920
Plug is Bucking up

2349
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,504
Has something he wants

2350
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,272
To get out

2351
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,552
And it's Bass

2352
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
Sickly

2353
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:42,624
That we should bring back America

2354
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:43,392
Can Empire

2355
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,184
So

2356
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,952
Yes

2357
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,720
Wow

2358
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,512
Where Alex goes with that

2359
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:50,048
Is very upsetting

2360
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:52,608
And I think invalidation of his entire career

2361
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,448
Because the secret of the New World Order is upon

2362
01:56:56,704 --> 01:57:00,544
What I wanted missions before you leave I know you got to cut out you got a lot of work to do

2363
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,848
But why is our flag only have

2364
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,128
50 stars

2365
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:09,760
You know recently it came out in the news 23 months ago that Trump was looking at buying Greenland or whatever and

2366
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:10,784
Corcino

2367
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,856
Now the whole country whatever is fine.

2368
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,392
Why don't we just go ahead and

2369
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:17,184
Do an expansion Safford

2370
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,208
And potentially make

2371
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:21,280
Bring another states of Union all over the planet

2372
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:25,632
You know in the street

2373
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,984
Design for not expanding or Contracting, just taking people over

2374
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:36,384
How about we say hey you want to sign on bringing in that way exactly we can have 100

2375
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:39,456
Population

2376
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:42,272
Weekly rally Nation

2377
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:45,088
The country has a big secret of the New World Order is

2378
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:46,880
Sold it as that

2379
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:53,280
But then it wasn't what it was over now make it hottie logical and people want to join without being made

2380
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:56,864
There's no reason why we can't have 100 stars in that Bluefield

2381
01:57:57,376 --> 01:58:00,448
I think it would just have to Haile that countries we should

2382
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:06,848
We should approach countries that are most like ours that the people are ready I mean what about the

2383
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:11,712
Get with the program

2384
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,992
Maybe get with the program

2385
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:17,088
Shopkin takeover the new world

2386

To send these guys to some sort of school

2393

Any sort of you should have to eat

2394
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:47,040
No community service no jail time you have to go to classes

2395
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:50,880
And learn about the s*** you are saying because you have nuts

2396
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:53,440
Do you hate emigrate

So much

2398
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:55,488
So let's just let them

2399
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,048
States and then they have free right

Expansionism

2404
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,408
Bring back the days of colonial Empire in

2405
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,944
And whatnot

2406
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:15,712
Which

2407
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,760
Probably isn't a good idea

2408
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:23,136
Whatever it is

2409
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,440
Question that I really hate

2410
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,232
Is is is that

2411
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,000
Alex

2412
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:33,632
Who's going to reveal is the big secret of the new world war was that improvised

2413
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:35,680
If it is

2414
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:40,544
I'm flummoxed by The Secret of the New World Order

2415
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,872
Can make an ideological

2416
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:45,664
New World Order Guide

2417
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,480
If that was intended that's insane

2418
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:52,832
If he's just riffing around it that's what is Braintree

2419
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:55,648
I think it applies on something

2420
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:00,512
One World Government

2421
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
So

2422
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:11,264
Every single thing about like what he pretends to stand for it's completely invalidate I walked

2423
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,544
One World Government

2424
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:16,128
Asterisk

2425
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:20,224
Wagner's list

2426
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:23,296
He is saying that if we don't do it China

2427
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,856
So at least he has some excuse there

2428
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,648
Secondarily

2429
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:30,464
You not necessarily talking about a One World Government

2430
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,000
Just talkin about

2431
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:36,096
Countries around the world that are now all America

2432
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:39,680
The other countries that are now China I guess he wants

2433
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:42,752
To World governments that will be in a battle for

2434
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:49,152
It will end with one of them being successful

2435
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:51,968
Most likely both of them

2436
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:55,040
This is dumb

2437
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,832
Go to school

2438
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:59,136
This is very

2439
02:00:59,392 --> 02:00:59,904
Is there a child

2440
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,744
Is Christ cic a very weird

2441
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,792
Mixture

2442
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,496
No singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas

2443
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:19,616
Nothing better than Jesus that's at least one

2444
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:21,664
You know there's Justice

2445
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,712
Mixture of

2446
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,736
Really

2447
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,784
Petulant child

2448
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:30,880
Stuff like the I want Trump's attention so badly why won't you give it to me

2449
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,672
Yeah I must Crush my enemies

2450
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
And you're not doing

2451
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:34,464
For me

2452
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,512
You have that mixed and

2453
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,072
Sweetly

2454
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:40,096
Luda

2455
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,120
Chris ideas

2456
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,144
Like Steve

2457
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,168
Coming in Target

2458
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:45,216
The end of representative government

2459
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:51,360
The South has risen again I killed Yitzhak rabin's

2460
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:57,760
Basketballs in that is coming in have a conversation about a need for us to be alone

2461
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,552
One World Government right

2462
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:03,904
You have these completely ludicrous ideas being presented

2463
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:07,232
But how would you explain why

2464
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:08,512
Florida secede

2465
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:13,376
Okay we're going to

2466
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:20,032
Texas if we are going to add in let's go with

2467
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:21,056
At one's ours now

2468
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:24,640
I'm going to go with we split Australian half

2469
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:26,432
I will take Sydney

2470
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,712
They get Melvin

2471
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:33,600
What else

2472
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:35,648
I think that's what they're doing

2473
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,208
Exist

2474
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,000
As ideas

2475
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:44,096
Just talkin

2476
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:44,864
Bulshit

2477
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:47,936
To the audience like all these ideas are

2478
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:48,704
Bulshit

2479
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,472
Yeah

2480
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:52,800
And then at the same time the third element of it is this input

2481
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:54,080
Callers isgro

2482
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,616
To appoint of

2483
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,408
Really scary input

2484
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,200
That mirrors some

2485
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:01,248
Pretty scary things

2486
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:04,064
So you have these three trends that are just

2487
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:06,368
I don't even

2488
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,160
The show is

2489
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696
Is it very bad

2490
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:14,304
It is interesting to me but only inasmuch as like

2491
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:18,912
I just continue to be just overwhelmed by the idea that people listen

2492
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:20,192
Come to it and take it serious

2493
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:23,776
Especially in the present-day the more this intuitive

2494
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,824
I can't believe people can't see through

2495
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:26,848
What he's doing

2496
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:31,200
He can't see through it Trump is doing I guess so he can

2497
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:33,760
You can see that he can he can

2498
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,832
He can't he can't bring himself to

2499
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:39,904
Too and I imagine that's the same thing that so many others

2500
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,184
He can't bring himself

2501
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,488
To because there's a financial motive

2502
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:50,400
I'm not sure how many of his audience members have

2503
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,728
It sucks

2504
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,264
To admit you've been

2505
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,056
True it suck

2506
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,080
Admit that

2507
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:00,384
Person that you believe so mode

2508
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,152
So much

2509
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,712
Is actually a lying piece of s*** grift

2510
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,272
It is a

2511
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:07,808
Common response

2512
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,088
To just say

2513
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,136
Doesn't matter

2514
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,928
Denial

2515
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,512
And it's

2516
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,280
Reading

2517
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,048
Towards

2518
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,840
Dangerous

2519
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,376
Conflagration

2520
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:23,680
Absolutely we will see what happens with that

2521
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:27,776
Hooray Christmas

2522
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:35,712
I will throw a hatchet

2523
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:40,832
But until then

2524
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:47,232
We are notorious at knowledge in the score fight and I go to bed Jordan we are on Facebook

2525
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,536
Castrol app

2526
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:52,864
Please download donate review the horse

2527
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,936
Girl doll

2528
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:57,728
Amir

2529
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:02,336
I single-handedly took down the Soviet Union

2530
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:10,528
Alex
