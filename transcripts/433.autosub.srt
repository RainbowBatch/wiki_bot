What up

10
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
I'm listening to a little bit of old stuff that I haven't listened to in a long time

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,248
Stop

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648

Because of that

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
The better part of a decade probably since I have put one of those albums on exercising

17
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Distance of not having made me able to listen to it again I appreciate

18
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
Is that okay

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
A little bit

20
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,544
Something that maybe I couldn't enjoy it as much as I originally gave you guys of overexposure grit

21
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
That's nice my bright spot is that the weather in Chicago is for the

22
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,552

Episode to do

00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,344
About May 12th and 13th

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Of this week

29
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
I wanted to throw Thursday and but it was impossible because this episode infuriated the s*** out of here

We are officially at 65 South Thursday out

This week

64
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
Made a discovery of something I I remember liking from my childhood

00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
Never have I found a more rain to beasts

Route of Andre

74
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,935
I knew something was up because I looked at the bottle of the clearly

75
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,799
Sparkling water beverage

76
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359
I don't know what to do

Eliza Clearly Canadian

78
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
I am saying with the mountain Blackberry was alright

79
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,535
Wild Cherry there was something wrong with that so bad

80
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,119
It might have gotten is a rocket carry

81
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,239
That's how I was coming into 22

82
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
Negative

83
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
Start listen to the hives

84
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
I don't remember what their song was

85
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
Incapable

86
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
Cuz they country raspberry with pretty good

00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Absolutely

89
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,567
So this is the nearest shelter will check back in next time and find out what we signed out

90
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,663
We got

91
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Episode

92
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,295
It's going to be a bumpy ride and here's another context route from Today Show

93
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,183
Wrestler Disney's already moved out

94
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207

95
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
We don't need to lose him

96
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Man

97
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,143
Feeling like

98
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,775
We got to direct our spiritual energy towards saving Rush Limbaugh

99
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
Be around the dinner table and just like

100
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
Heavenly Father

101
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,735
Look after Rush Limbaugh

102
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,831
I guess it's a little less because Alex is in the same field

103
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,719
Kind of kind of like their contemporaries or something

104
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
F****** weird

105
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
I remained totally neutral

106
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
And whatever you decide to do to him

107
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,663
So why we start off the show at the beginning of it

108
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
Talking about how like if you

109
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:57,343
Through the globalist plan you understand it really easily

110
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Like himself

111
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
Sure drained metaphor that he tries to make

112
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
Free one that app

113
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
The globalist and how they operate

114
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
Philosophy

115
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
It's just like

116
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Professional Barrel

117
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
Absolutely Elementary

118
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
My dear Watson

119
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
You got to have the courage

120
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
And I liked it it

121
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
Allegory or an analogy

122
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
Most big comets and asteroids

123
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
But end up being found

124
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
Most ever found by the millions of amateur astronomers

125
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
But my powered

126
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Capitalism

127
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
Probably sounds pretty good to Alex I don't know

128
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Extended metaphor

129
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
Amateur astronomers at 2

130
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Isn't true

131
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
Amateur astronomers do not discover most of the near-earth objects that are found each year

132
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847
That's why it's always a big story when an amateur does discover one which gets a lot of press

133
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,527
It professionals at the big telescope for find a comet all the time how come I only read headlines about amateurs finding

134
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,135
You can easily see how that selection bias but Alex's brain uses to land on

135
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
That's what's going on

136
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
Doesn't do any research on the topic he decides what he's just

137
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Thought up with

138
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
True

139
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
No every the day today

140
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:03,039
The case that is not like the others but headlines are pointing up

141
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,183
What is perception that amateurs find more than the professionals is probably partially due to the fact that like

142
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
Hale-Bopp was found by amateurs

143
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,863
High-profile nature

144
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
According to a 2015 paper co-written by members of the jet propulsion laboratory the minor planet center and the universe

145
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
Reviews of Hawaii and Helsinki

146
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:30,687
From 1998 through 2013 only about 1.8%

147
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,551
Of the 10,000 and 44 discovered near-earth objects were found by the amateur community

148
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Okay not what Alex

149
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Alright

150
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,207
Is a minority-majority

151
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,583
That's true enough

152
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
Supported professional astronomers discovered the vast majority of near-earth asteroids

153
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
Follow-up observations needed to pinpoint the orbits and predict

154
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
The future motions of the asteroid

155
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,295
Once a new near-earth asteroid is discovered the efficiency with which amateurs provide these follow-up observations

156
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,111
Professional telescope

157
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
To continue scanning the skies for more new discoveries

158
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:19,839
There is a cool professional amateur collaboration

159
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Is not true

160
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
It feels true to him though because he never reads past the headline

161
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
About the many discoveries that are made

162
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,687
Any never reads headlines about the discoveries are made by scientists and professionals with the labs because they don't make headlines

163
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:39,295
They're just taking credit for all the it what's what's an amateur other than that you don't like

164
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,903
Who's to say the people at Nasa aren't finding these on their off-hours that mean

165
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,375
I think the larger Point that he's trying to make he's the amateur astronomer sees the metaphorical comment heading

166
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
Towards us which is of course the globalist evil plant

167
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:05,407
Like the media or something he saying

168
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,503
I said I think that's the point because I was really doesn't complete the metaphor yet

169
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
Instead thinking about the Stars

170
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
And in the process

171
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
Who makes an admission that I find remarkable

00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
It's something that I would consider a big interest of Alex's based on everything I've heard from his show

189
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Started frequently

190
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,071
He does talk about going to the Stars

191
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,423
You got to look for where you're going first and elope

192
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
It should give you some sense of the kind of money Alex comes from because it's out spotted $25,000 telescope

193
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
It wasn't because you was making loads of cash

194
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,967
He's talked about his earlier jobs and everything's like assisting a Tyvek

195
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
Clinic in carpet cleaning

196
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
By the way

197
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,855
$5,000

198
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
$44,000 today adjusted for inflation

199
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
You better give you some idea of the type of purchase he's talking about on air

200
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
That's basically a year's salary at any of the jobs he's claiming to have had prior to getting into radio

201
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
I remember when I was

202
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
Around that age and my dad help

203
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,591
Get a loan for my first car that cost $2,500

204
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
Wasn't really negotiated

205
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
I don't think so

206
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
A rich and you basically just got whatever he wanted growing up

207
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
Specifics of the story lead me to suspect the latter

208
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
No names of things there's a lot of specifics

209
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Yeah that's not good

210
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Makes me think it's worth through cuz I

211
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Why else would you tell the story about it like

212
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,967
Pull myself up by my bootstraps

213
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
25 Grand

214
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
That'd be great

215
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
I would appreciate that more

216
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:05,119
Continues as metaphor a little bit and becoming is this fantasy where

217
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
You know again I think I think those analogs that I was saying I Keys the amateur astronomer.

218
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,895
This is where he tells a story about it and I think there is

219
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Hey this is kind of sad

220
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,159
We've talked about people in the yard

221
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
Genie coming out of the Kuiper belt

222
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Pass Pluto

223
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
A 20th planet

224
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
What

225
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
Pluto's not even a planet anymore bro

226
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Astronomer

227
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,759
Photographs of this thing entering our solar system

228
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Pluto

229
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Coming in

230
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
A million miles an hour

231
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
People begin to anywhere

232
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
Picking up

233
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Call the government and Industry

234
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
I see this

235
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
How did

236
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,807
CIA

237
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
My God

238
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
They know this planets coming in

239
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
You are

240
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Solar system

241
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
Why did they make the decision.

242
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Vitalis

243
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
And then you,

244
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
With the realization

245
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
The mathematicians that it's going to hit Earth

246
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
So you do need professional

247
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Scrapped out there

248
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,415
No I made it with nuclear weapons and blow it up

249
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
This is the plot of The Fifth Element

250
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Humanity

251
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Little bit closer

252
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Is The Fifth Element

253
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
It's not a planet

254
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Galaxy just watch The Fifth Element

255
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Where is Miller

256
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
The coherent metaphor

257
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
For what he's trying to say

258
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
He usually isn't capable of that

259
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
More or less

260
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Tracks

261
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
Like he's trying to make

262
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,671
Is the globalist playing finding talks about

263
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
He talks about it

264
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
Google's plan is coming and they wanted to come pick up and start looking planet

265
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,727
Are the people who he's indoctrinated

266
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:28,127
Conspiracy theory followers

267
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Whatever

268
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
I don't understand it

269
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,647
It makes sense.

270
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
I applaud

271
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Okay

272
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
Praise

273
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
A grant

274
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
Completely off track before he's able

275
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Make something kind of makes

276
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
Unfortunately even if the metaphor holds

277
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
There's some holes

278
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:16,255
For instance what if you're an amateur astronomer you find an asteroid you insist is new and of course

279
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:22,655
It's on its way to hit

280
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Discovered

281
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
Calculations you made about its orbit are wrong

282
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
Your work but it's also possible that you did a bad job

283
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,535
Let me take a look at your evidence and tell you that you're mistaken that's a rock formation you think it's a dead engine

284
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,631
A imagination is Fun making things up

285
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,031
Is metaphor in playing around with what I'm doing

286
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,639
I can see what's going on here

287
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,735
This case I can actually engage with it a little bit

288
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,879
I think even in the hypothetical realm that he's talking about you can clearly see how like oh no you didn't

289
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
You didn't find an asteroid

290
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
Astrology

291
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
Gary Oldman

292
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,400
$25,000 telescope will not give you an understanding of space

293
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
Still need to learn

294
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,544
Oh that's true

295
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,664
Baby inside baseball

296
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Coming up

297
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,016
I thought about talking about the president what really goes on White House

298
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
My forces

299
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Bird's eye view

300
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Longview under the towel

301
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
He watches TV and eat junk food

302
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Shut up

303
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
Assholes

304
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
No I can do it justice

305
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Cuz

306
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
It's actually

307
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
Positive

308
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
You know what

309
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
Last segment of the shower remind me to do a guys

310
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
It's very very sad

311
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
It's also very very empower

312
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
Yep that's

313
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:42,432
Cuz I don't know what he's talking about

314
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,808
I think someone forgot to reply

315
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,904
So it is next life we get to Alex talk about how cool it is

316
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
To drive fast

317
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
But

318
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,280
Is not telling the story to sound cool because sounding cool is uncool

319
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
This is a guy who's obsessed with coolness

320
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
How fast they are

321
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
Almost 200 Mi an hour

322
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
It's fine

323
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,456
Oh my gosh midnight out there there's not a damn far

324
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Freeport Lane

325
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
Absolutely

326
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
About 150 while back

327
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
There's one huh

328
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
I'm outside the Austin had the car.

329
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
Dukes of Hazzard man

330
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Noosa hazard

331
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Stop right there

332
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
Is a new show

333
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Shelby stories

334
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Because

335
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
There is

336
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,320
Cool because

337
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,672
He is trying to look cool

338
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
This is a white paradox

339
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm also back when I was like 18

340
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,376
Do love driving over big humps

341
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,496
46

342
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,040
I'm not telling cool stories

343
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
Is that what you talking about beating all these famous people

344
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,000
Write a meeting saving people

345
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
Famous thing you can do is be not famous

346
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Stabbed

347
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,656
The one of these famous people interact

348
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
May have gotten in trouble

349
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
For interacting with Alex

350
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,360
Translator

351
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
Lisa email

352
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Attorney

353
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Southern

354
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
To arrest him

355
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
Deal

356
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,816
Mark Cuban owned a company that wasn't a 911 film loose change

357
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
This documentary in quotes by Alex and Dylan Avery release

358
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
Easter 2005

359
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
If it was considered what they called a living document which is code for things they were constantly

360
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,016
The super embarrassing stuff not be in it

361
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,112
In 2007 the third version came out called Loose Change Final Cut

362
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:36,768
Popular property in conspiracy theory world and Alex signed on as an executive producer for the Final Cut

363
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Diversion

364
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,912
In Fords

365
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:49,312
Actually Apparently one of the things I read Charlie Sheen was it

366
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,688
Barbie career to worry about

367
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,040
Jason bermas would go on

368
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:05,440
Earlier days and Warrior

369
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
Work on loose change predates all of that

370
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
Dylan Avery incidentally has gone on to continue working it movie

371
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Zendaya in that industry

372
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
Not on conspiracy documentaries

373
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,216
Because

374
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:24,128
At the age of 18

375
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:30,272
Is a collection of articles that trace the roots of 9/11

376
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
Literally 9/11 conspiracy theories

377
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,000
Avery was inspired by this book to make a movie

378
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,120
According to an article in slate discovered of government

379
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Cover up

380
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,544
Essentially he was going to make a fiction movie about people discovering that the government did 9/11 but he realized that was too defensive

381
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,872
The government do 9/11

382
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,688
Okay so he just made The Blair Witch Project

383
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,344
Yeah but you was into it at the time.

384
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,512
Give me the article from 2011 stall

385
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Show me article

386
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
You still says he supports the

387
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,936
Getting sucked in deeper than you

388
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,800
Into a hardcore mentality that it was almost too easy to get into back then

389
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,152
Because the war just started and everybody was just so pissed off

390
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,272
When he says he still supports the movement he means that he's are some unanswered questions about 9/11

391
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
But that's not what Loose Change was about primarily

392
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,208
Dylan Avery was a bright ambitious used to channel does energies into the world of conspiracy

393
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
It's kind of hardening to it

394
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,304
Know that at least to some extent he got out of it

395
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,656
I found a 2017 interview with the outline Which online

396
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Princeton

397
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,008
When the interviewer ask them where

398
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,104
I never did rely on Infowars as a source but I definitely don't know

399
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,968
Anyway it's just kind of funny that the director of the movie that Alex claims of his own which helps

400
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
Really put us on the map

401
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,184
We all need to grow up

402
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
So what is Mark Cuban

403
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Companies looking to distribute loose change

404
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Unrelated

405
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,632
Play the SEC was investigating Mark Cuban for insider trading

406
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,032
In the course of that investigation Cuban release an email

407
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,616
Cuban was

408
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Alright

409
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,504
This lawyer definitely something's emails because of Cubans almost Distributing

410
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,344
You had nothing to do with Cubans insider-trading investigation

411
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,696
He was suspended for 42 weeks for his behavior and then eventually fired

412
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
Sec

413
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
We're sending

414
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,632
Post an internal SEC email which were determined to be inappropriate

415
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,984
12 article on Reuters this lawyer Jeffrey Norris

416
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
What a federal appeal in his case that he deserved

417
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,176
A chance to get his job back by presenting medical evidence that those actions won't happen again

418
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
Fihi argued that his life situation was chaotic back when you sent those emails and that he'd been seeing a psychiatrist and

419
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Santa's in his life

420
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
To the point where

421
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
It wouldn't be that again

422
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,048
Business Insider was able to find some Internet comments that Norris made around that time of those emails

423
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:27,936
It kind of seems like he just particular

424
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Expand

425
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
In one combat North suggest

426
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,592
The Cubans threw a recent game against the Warriors for some Financial motive

427
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
It partially sounds paranoid and partially like a guy f****** around it is talking s*** about Mark Cuban it's unclear

428
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
I got it I got it

429
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
Snow being an SEC lawyer I might be more inclined to enjoy it but I get what you say

430
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
Scores were

431
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,448
Hatred of Mark Cuban

432
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,520
Whatever

433
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
Anyway just wanted nothing to do with humans ABC insider-trading case

434
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,992
Just turned it into proof of the SEC

435
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,296
Cuban for Distributing Alex's film

436
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,112
Bernard Jordan

437
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184
Remember I told you the beginning of this Nikes

438
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
But Alex would have

439
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
My favorite lie

440
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
My town for this

441
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
This is breathtaking

442
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
Once you don't want them they really want your soul

443
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Okay

444
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,704
In Hollywood that is

445
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,776
Here's a 3 million dollar deal to star in this movie

446
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
It's a space fantasy movie

447
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
You're a space

448
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
The movie

449
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,696
Pictures later on in the theater watching this

450
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Huge movie

451
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
I would have been cool to play that guy

452
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
Like the most valuable thing in my life

453
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
My children and then doing the right thing

454
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,752
. will drive up like for things like that

455
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,824
The big giant franchise

456
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,432
Kurt Russell was in a second

457
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,880
Valuable in the final equation

458
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:27,488
Major huge movies

459
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,560
So I think you know what you talk about

460
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,960
Do you know what movies are playing

461
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,776
I could sell discount Russells

462
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,872
Entire entire filmography and there's only one movie

463
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,200
That's a sequel that Kurt Russell wasn't in the original

464
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,248
End of the space fantasy worth it

465
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:55,904
Kurt Russell was also in Naperville

466
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,304
Furious 7. Whatever

467
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
But he wasn't

468
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
AMC movie

469
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
Yet he was in the first Soldier but he was definitely

470
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
He thinks that he was up for the Chris Pratt

471
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,384
In Guardians of the Galaxy

472
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,480
Star-Lord

473
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,320
Do you think the James Gunn

474
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Was like

475
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
We don't even need to do an audition

476
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Anyway

477
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,744
Get me Jones alright

478
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
Wow that's great awesome

479
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,608
That's no good

480
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,984
First Guardians of the Galaxy film came out in 2014

481
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
Operative star six years 2000

482
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,200
Which unfortunately predates the start of production by about 4 years

483
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,784
At that point

484
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,184
To be written

485
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,584
This isn't the point you protecting you is offered the starring role

486
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,192
Play billionaire Rich Playboy

487
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,080
All right and Iraq or whatever and it gets captured

488
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
I don't know how it is

489
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:25,248
I'll tell you that right now

490
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

491
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:36,256
You were offered movie role

492
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,608
I still don't answer your face about it

493
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,984
Identifying details like his lies just too egregious

494
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,224
Stanford

495
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,648
Are you at group God damn it I'm.

496
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:10,048
Also according to style

497
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
Is just coming off Parks and Rec

498
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,912
Cast member

499
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:21,312
Like parts of parks and rec

500
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
TV Guide

501
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,920
Alex's radio

502
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,736
He had a roll yelling into a bullhorn

503
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:35,648
The movie The Only Reason

504
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:42,048
Get the f*** out of here

505
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,936
This is this is what I'm talking about

506
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Country Door

507
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,544
I heard that we're done

508
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
Domino's Pizza

509
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,712
Reimagining Guardians of the Galaxy

510
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:06,112
Michael Rooker role complex

511
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
Able to handle angry

512
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,144
Capable translate nobody

513
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Good morning

514
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,824
No I don't think he could pull that off

515
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,992
I don't even think he could do the opening crawl scene with Chris Pratt dancing I don't think that's the issue would be distracted

516
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,000
F*** you Alex

517
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
Get the f*** out of here

518
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Universe

519
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
Is way more fun than ours

520
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
The movie would be very different

521
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,872
Alright well we got our phones

522
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,688
I don't I don't think of dead yet I'm just going to

523
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,760
Taste bad for 11 for a little bit

524
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:12,160
And Alex with a spica cast

525
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:36,224
Articulating these things is gross even though

526
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,784
Trying to say I think he's saying as a interview

527
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
Something like that

528
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Old crappy car

529
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,960
All the rest on your head

530
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,824
That is a connection to God has you and that's beautiful

531
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Beautiful

532
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
They are amazing

533
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
I see the most beautiful people that don't have God eyes are dead

534
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
Is God

535
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Body Shop

536
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,072
Good it doesn't matter if they're beautiful

537
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,400
Woman is ServSafe to be the most beautiful body

538
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
You ever imagine it's like

539
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Plastic mannequin

540
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
It's not

541
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Real

542
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Justice and freedom

543
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,856
Your financial support so weird

544
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,512
A relationship just that like

545
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,096
Because I can't have it

546
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,936
You look so awful

547
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,544
It's not good

548
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,592
Yeah

549
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
I could use your

550
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
So I guess is the covid-19 positive cases that are in the White House

551
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Send Sachi

552
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:22,720
You're at the virus isn't real uses to deal with this story on its real terms because I think he recognizes that the way

553
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,024
He would cover the realities

554
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
Be dangerous

555
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,400
Self quarantining

556
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,472
Because the White House has a Contagion

557
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
Vardy

558
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,920
Testing positive no.16 asymptomatic

559
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:48,320
So Alex refuses to cover the other aspects of the covid-19 in the White House like he's very consistently

560
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,136
8 secret service members

561
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,720
Which is bad on its own you know but there's more to it than that

562
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,376
There's at least two staffers in the executive branch of tested positive

563
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,752
Who's married to someone who has close contact with everyone

564
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,288
As of May 11th

565
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
CNN was reporting that the person who Miller caught the virus from is unknown

566
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:21,600
Forcep to wear masks at the office and apparently

567
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,904
Trump's economic advisor

568
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
Scary to go to work

569
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
S*** is not good

570
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,424
Also by the time houses on the air

571
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,008
He's not doing a good job

572
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,568
Is minimizing the old news while sent

573
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
Last teeth hurt even more Secret Service

574
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
Recovered

575
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,576
Not nearly the small problem Alex and pretending

576
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:57,696
Well if Alex were to cover here's how Alex would cover it

577
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,280
They're killing the president

578
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:07,424
We have to act right

579
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,824
Drift really quickly into Insurrection territory

580
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,640
Telling them to go assassinate people near the

581
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,600
It's up to minimize thing to that level

582
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,136
Stare

583
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
Slurred 1 * who's like they're poisoning president president is literally

584
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:40,448
Times were different back then whatever you really want

585
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,032
The meat packing plant

586
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:49,920
Himself he doesn't understand what asymptomatic cases

587
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
A bunch of deaths linked to workers

588
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,576
Do plants complete disrespect these people and their families

589
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,904
Do you have to go to work to continue

590
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,256
The ability of people to have food process

591
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,840
He's minimizing the experience that they're having to deal with that

592
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,424
Abhorrent

593
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,288
McAlister's

594
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
A better word

595
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:24,480
News on this episode cauchy's testimony

596
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
They didn't do a good job

597
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,880
Reserve a little clip of this because I mean

598
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
It would be exhausting

599
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Need to go over all of it

600
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
Fauci announcing

601
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
Reasonable martial law

602
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,352
I said many times

603
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
We have worked out

604
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
Is a guideline framework

605
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
You safely

606
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,895
What we have workout

607
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
How you safely

608
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
Bill Gates

609
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
Doesn't matter all my glass hold

610
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
50 * wrong

611
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,535
And making our move

612
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
Let's hear from him

613
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:17,471
Business strategy and kind of feels like a remembering a bit he hasn't done is just going to try

614
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,287
Play some video

615
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,359
He also realizes

616
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
You build up his image of them is arch-villain

617
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:31,551
So when he tries to actually know play longer clips

618
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,879
Fairly well

619
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,279
Constant interruptions

620
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Patxi's words in complete set

621
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:49,983
Some technique also breaks in

622
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,847
80 distract the audience with references to completely unrelated aspect of his conspiracy narrative

623
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
Things that have no bearing on what

624
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
Thought you saying at all

625
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,991
Yeah and for good measure he calls them nerds he's like

626
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,855
Tell me what to do

627
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:11,999
McKay's analysis use the strategy it out here in the same thing over and over again

628
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,559
Interesting

629
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,935
It just goes on and on for like two segments of the show where Alex just makes himself mad listening Saatchi

630
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
Been interrupting do impressions of the Elegance talking

631
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,055
Why he's a childhood

632
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
Alex has a guest on

633
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,967
This episode because

634
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,551
More the Project Camelot side of things

635
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,647
Appearances really all that interesting except for the fact

636
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Kind of interesting

637
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
We have

638
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
Also joining us this.

639
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
Possible

640
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,543
UFO Invasion that's what I told the crew today

641
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
I'm glad I read that

642
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Baked

643
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
Project Blue beam

644
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
You and

645
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Name five more planets

646
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Invasion

647
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
Artificial

648
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
UFO

649
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Guys

650
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Reboot

651
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,487
Alright let's just go to break

652
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:54,143
Jesus

653
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,007
That was surreal

654
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
Okay

655
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,015
Impossible to argue with the alt right

656
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,927
Ludacris.

657
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
Exactly

658
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
But just

659
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Perfect essence

660
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
The right way

661
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,615
Steven Greer is a big name in the world is like a alien

662
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,711
Disclosure

663
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:43,551
Project Camelot episode

664
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
Specifically

665
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,159
Eazy-E figure that some of the

666
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,487
Maybe some of the weirder alien folk distrust

667
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,887
Documentaries about him and I think maybe

668
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
He's a bit of a like

669
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,239
Alien Dude Perfect

670
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:06,079
Nicky's II do remember that

671
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
I think I think he does have an actual doctor

672
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,479
I don't know how relevant

673
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,879
For as long as I've known about it

674
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,415
Guyon

675
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,815
Wants to talk about how they're planning to do a fake alien infection

676
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
Alex

677
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:35,007
Explain why you having this conversation because it's even absurd for his show

678
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
So this is how we tried to do that

679
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Greer Park

680
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Point

681
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,711
A couple of his books and I probably had to say

682
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,295
Forgot into UFOs and all of this because

683
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
Real

684
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,463
Shadow government

685
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
But

686
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,071
Now is ready for the day

687
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
Couple hours next week

688
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
The show is descendants

689
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,967
Else to do I'm not going I don't have any

690
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,807
I don't find it at all interesting diculous

691
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Alex

692
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
Gushing over this guy

693
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,679
It's because I listen to the next day and this whole thing is fun

694
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,239
Drop like a hot potato it's not

695
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:44,383
I think it was just a weird because this guy has a new documentary coming out she wants

696
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,855
Traffic

697
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,647
So I don't really care

698
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,255
Greer promote his documentary and Alex's interview with

699
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
But

700
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
It is David Alan Grier will promote

701
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
But

702
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:11,263
If out does continue down the road of saying there's going to be

703
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,663
I promise if he keeps it up for now we just use like a blip on the radar

704
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,455
The rest of the 12

705
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,831
Is a weird day weird day

706
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
I mean

707
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,927
It's hard to get weirder than Alex saying that he was going to be in Guardians of the Galaxy

708
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
And that is because he has

709
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,631
And I got on my knees about 3 a.m. this morning when I woke up

710
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
NASCAR

711
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,983
Give me the guidance and direction to not

712
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
Indigestion

713
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,335
Calmly

714
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
Information you was best

715
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Give you the

716
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,015
Very soothing music

717
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,063
I'm right now you'll see the live show

718
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
Feed title

719
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
Global bombshell

720
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,231
Who confirms

721
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,607
Them on a planetary scale

722
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
I have an entire

723
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
Folder

724
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,615
The United Nations

725
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
Admitting they're doing

726
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
I think about

727
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Think about it

728
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:37,791
There's no news here!

729
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,495
This isn't the news article in it

730
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,799
It's literally a blog post that just

731
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,359
Including the show that Alex is in the middle of

732
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:57,247
East sightings of the process of the show he's in the middle of doing

733
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,783
That is

734
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Spectacular

735
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,647
Preston that's really great

736
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:07,999
I have never seen an Ouroboros in real life

737
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
Is really gorgeous

738
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:15,935
It's circular citation confirm

739
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:21,311
Play whatever I'm going to say in half an hour

740
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,663
You are a weirdo

741
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:31,295
Future proves what I'm saying in the past because eventually the future will be the past

742
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,855
It's pretty wild

743
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,511
Cool thing on this episode is going to be this World Health Organization and all these folks have admitted that they put sterilants at the vaccines

744
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,095
In order to make people unable to reproduce and what have you

745
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
So that will be a large pieces

746
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,471
Over which the rest of the Alex's episode

747
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
Also of course

748
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,591
There's going to be a bunch of weird other s*** going on

749
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
With his commitment

750
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,967
To be focused

751
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
So you don't stay on topic for a

752
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,039
Sinbad

753
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Tablet

754
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Let me go see what

755
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,791
Play a video

756
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,631
Buy a group like

757
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Anyone

758
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
I don't know what that means

759
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
Talking about

760
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Interviewing

761
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
About 8

762
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
Yeah they wouldn't dare do that

763
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Course this morning

764
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
20 m

765
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
All I did was type

766
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
I've been

767
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
HCG

768
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,287
Website

769
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
Admitted

770
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:10,367
UK group is and I don't really care because everything reported they're talking about

771
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,463
I have no idea that Rabbit Trail down

772
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:20,351
Does not admit on their website HCG sterilized

773
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:26,751
In fact if you go to the website read their materials easy-to-understand explanation for how this misinformation work

774
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,639
Julie milstein P David Griffin and JW Lee release paper called quote

775
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:37,503
Imitation programs for misinformation on contraceptive vaccine

776
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,807
Which explains the dynamic play

777
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,719
There was a campaign to attack vaccine

778
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
Supported

779
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
Executed by the World Health Organization

780
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:54,911
Which was a clinical trial

781
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
Designed to provide

782
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
Protection against

783
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,519
Four. Of 122

784
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
Ears

785
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:05,151
The active ingredient that birth control with HCG or human chorionic

786
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Them

787
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,527
Which is a hormone necessary for pregnancy to begin

788
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:17,183
In order for this hormone to be delivered it needed a carrier and then this Indian study that use diphtheria and tetanus toxoid

789
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
Which reproduce

790
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
Adjuster visit carrier

791
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Took the stud

792
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,311
In lab

793
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,919
Vaccines were sent to hospital Laboratory

794
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,783
Which word assessment and are not appropriate for a vaccine

795
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:48,927
Because they're using something that it was a test that it wasn't made to Analyze This

796
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
And they were able to quit

797
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,071
They found low levels of HCG like activity in some samples

798
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
That was enough to create a narrative

799
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:03,519
Actual researchers followed up in quotes when the vaccines were tested in Laboratories which used properly validated test systems

800
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
The results clearly show that the vaccines did not contain HCG

801
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,199
This was validated by six Laboratories in five countries but it doesn't matter

802
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,015
Aronia science confirm the conclusion these folks are looking

803
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,087
Corsa weather

804
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,927
They just ignore that about the erroneous. They wanted to believe to begin with

805
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:27,839
That's the root of what a bunch of this they're putting steroids in the vaccine stuff explanation

806
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,887
Super easy to understand

807
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,935
Is there. Just keeps popping up over time

808
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,543
Africa check traced have the same as information was being used in 2014

809
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
Clean the World Health Organization was conducting a quote Master relaxation exercise in Kenya masquerading as a tetanus back

810
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,879
Boca storage

811
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,183
Women of childbearing age because

812
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
One of the concerns

813
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,535
Is the children dying from tetanus early

814
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,607
Enabled

815
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,655
Take those tetanus related deaths

816
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,191
So far down

817
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
In the developed world

818
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,567
You know you take the the the demographic that would

819
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,615
Be most help by the vaccine

820
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,711
Turn fat into some sort of a nefarious conspiracy about

821
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
Trying to make people

822
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,783
The plan

823
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,879
It's a mess we always have a manhole Within

824
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
3 ft of each other

825
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
And

826
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:29,791
If somebody says anything anti-vax bulshit you get to pushing down the manhole

827
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,071
That is my new law

828
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:35,167
As long as it's only an inconvenience 10000000 manholes across

829
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:41,567
Chicago as long as

830
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,431
Dirty water movie

831
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,991
Society

832
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,551
After two years you may be able to come back

833
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,623
That'll be an interesting way to do things

834
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
Probably

835
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:00,767
Approved all this stuff about it

836
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,095
Pencil 880

837
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,543
I've known so much information for so long

838
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,711
Hey

839
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
Here it is

840
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,551
Here's the URL on the UN website

841
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
That's why you want to use a

842
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Something else

843
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,815
Yippee interesting hold on to that thought for later

844
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:41,215
URL there

845
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,495
Quote

846
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:48,639
HCG founded World Health Organization tetanus vaccine concerns in the developing world

847
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:54,527
Published in the open-access library journal and let's just say it has an interesting history

848
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:01,183
Firstly it's just based on the same nonsense about the tetanus vaccine that can place the India birth control shot study with

849
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:09,375
This was a paper that was written by two researchers named Shaw and

850
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:15,263
Who had a history about vaccines

851
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
Is it okay

852
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
In 2016 they put out a paper in the journal vaccine

853
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,735
HPV and behavioral issues

854
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:35,231
This article has been withdrawn at the request of the editor-in-chief due to Serious concerns regarding the scientific soundness of the art

855
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:41,375
Review by the editor-in-chief and evaluation by outside experts

856
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,935
And the claims that the article makes or unjust

857
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,775
This was Shah in Tamil

858
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:52,895
Third study-related seriously flawed

859
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:57,759
History is littered with paper

860
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,295
In the generous interpretation

861
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,367
Aspersion

862
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:08,511
Headline Alex flashed up on screen

863
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,815
The World Health Organization website

864
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,375
So their basic plan is to try and get something

865
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,703
Published for at least a little bit then it's retracted

866
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,543
Then make music for a right-wing propaganda

867
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,823
Their plan

868
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
You know if that's what you're suggesting

869
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
Maybe

870
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
Beyonce

871
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:31,807
Furby to say like hey they've done all this stuff repeatedly in the past messenger and you know

872
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,855
You can't just say that you know just goes there

873
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,903
They are there clear history of not being good

874
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
And turns out this paper is worthless as well

875
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:48,447
In the paper they did no new tasks they just relied on data that already existed and was part of that 2014 campaign

876
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,103
There's honestly not much more to it than that it's just a rehashing of the tetanus birth control shot

877
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
Confusion propaganda

878
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,663
Literally all it is

879
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,735
The study doesn't prove anything but doesn't show any new information

880
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,039
It's just a republishing of an already debunked

881
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,831
Conspiracy theory about vaccines

882
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Oh my

883
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,391
My God it's the

884
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:12,511
Paper version of Alex posting his video on his own blog

885
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:19,935
Another important remember is that you

886
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:22,495
It would make you temporarily unable to get pregnant

887
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:26,079
Many people opt for the depo-provera shot as a means of birth

888
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:30,175
Control and have to get that every 3 months to control reproduction

889
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,223
Permanent sterilization Alex's imagine

890
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
Is going to go with

891
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
But whatever

892
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:38,367
Justice fantasy supported discredited work of a vaxelis

893
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:43,743
Also the open-access library Journal is not a credible outlet that you would accept

894
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
Take your time to make an

895
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
You might like this

896
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:52,447
The fact that Alex has an article this article is a primary source that he relies on big claims that he's taking information

897
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,007
The World Health Organization

898
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,055
Is this the definition of dishonest

899
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:01,151
That's what there's a lot of this is based on where it's coming from

900
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
And its rash

901
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,503
So of course I got to connect

902
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,319
Bill Gates in here we got to complain about him a little bit

903
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,111
Find

904
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Hitler

905
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,839
India through his ass out

906
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
There are a lot of folks in India man

907
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,103
But do you really want to sign on to sterilizing

908
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
Where's this going

909
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,991
You can see it from his perspective Until you realize

910
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:45,695
So I don't know how he comes off when he says that he kind of understands

911
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:56,959
To me that's totally fine exterminate people the developing world

912
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:02,079
Summarize the principal said that I would never say something like that

913
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:07,711
That sounds like someone who I would be very comfortable in a white supremacist authoritarian state

914
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,783
A race specific biome

915
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,855
Seems like a

916
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:19,743
The story The Bill Gates on Gates Foundation is completely not true

917
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:26,143
It was something in 2017

918
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,031
Some media reports have suggested that all health-related collaboration with the Gates Foundation

919
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
National

920
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
Has been stopped

921
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,407
This is inaccurate and misleading

922
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:42,783
Melinda Gates Foundation continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family welfare

923
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:49,695
The propaganda

924
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,487
In April 2012

925
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,815
After the reports that seven of the youths of the trial had died

926
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,911
Subsequent investigations found that the deaths were not related to the back

927
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,215
Magazine

928
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:06,847
One girl drowned in a quarry another died from a snake bite

929
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,151
And one died from complications of malaria

930
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:16,063
Investigators deemed the other two dance unlikely to have been related to the vaccine

931
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,183
This is just absolutely

932
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:25,023
Propaganda narrative

933
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
Thinks of credible

934
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,447
That's the level of workout lazy and delicious

935
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
Also I think you just

936
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
The making

937
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,543
The part about Pakistan

938
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:41,151
Because in September 2019

939
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:46,271
Pakistan

940
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:50,367
It will commit approximately 200 million dollars in support of the FPS

941
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,391
Initiative

942
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:57,279
A comprehensive effort in combating poverty and improving Health Nutrition in financial inclusion in that country

943
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,119
The prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan

944
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:07,519
I'm pleased the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will assist with a range of activities including accelerating stunting Reduction Program

945
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,823
Supporting Financial inclusion initiatives

946
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,383
Investing in public health systems to improve health

947
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,943
Introduce maternal newborn and child mortality

948
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,343
This one

949
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
Emmaline

950
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:28,767
Which is presented to his audiences which is just unacceptable

951
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,071
Istanbul

952
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,263
Look up kicked out of a bar before it's just a billionaire when you get kicked out of a bar

953
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Send his money over

954
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,871
He's not invited back interesting but also rule

955
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,919
Also no record is that okay

956
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
But the thing is the Bill Gates

957
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
Big bad guy

958
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,039
Did you know

959
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,575
But there's a council

960
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
12

961
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,671
Lovett the world

962
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,047
Alex doesn't know

963
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,399
Okay that's an issue just makes me really sad for a conspiracy theorist

964
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
I've been really researching millgate

965
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
4 years

966
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
He is

967
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,175
The science officer on

968
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Committee

969
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Course

970
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
Rotating

971
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:25,855
Members

972
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
And there are

973
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,607
Galahad

974
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,911
Lancelot

975
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
10

976
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
Information out

977
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:58,879
It makes more sense that he doesn't notice

978
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,999
Or like in a politburo

979
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,279
You're allowed to retire

980
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:11,679
From the council soros's in there probably the mix

981
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:16,031
Well

982
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,567
Calories in there

983
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:23,967
I don't I think she was kick Obama Obama

984
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,039
Past presidents

985
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,087
12 is a better number for a council

986
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:35,487
Stella D'oro

987
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:40,607
Bolsonaro's in there's always have crazy is that

988
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:47,007
No bolsonaro's not both

989
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:52,383
I know Alex has been not talking about bolsonaro this whole time

990
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Could be

991
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:57,759
Could be

992
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,647
Arguments in order to minimize the the covid-19 situation

993
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,183
Which I find disgraceful

994
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Contested

995
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,031
300

996
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
Because its effect

997
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:28,479
This is such a monster get away with it

998
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:35,135
On May 8th the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the second deck that income for people infected at a local meat packing plant

999
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,159
This person

1000
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
Condition decline so quickly

1001
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,767
Receive Advanced treatment records show

1002
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,607
That same day Business Insider reported at least 48 me pack

1003
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,911
Can plant workers have died but covid-19

1004
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:50,751
If you consider that as Business Insider also pointed out

1005
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:55,359
Employers are not required to track coronavirus cases among workers for recent guidance

1006
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:02,015
And does not require on-site inspections for worker complaints related to the virus you consider that the number of infected

1007
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,087
And possibly related deaths could be much higher than the numbers we know

1008
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,999
Alex's lamps on to this story out of Missouri where 373 workers at a Triumph pork plant

1009
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,279
For covid-19

1010
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
But the stories about the case

1011
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,607
Asymptomatic

1012
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,727
This is an interesting headline but also failed to capture a lot of the relevant information about the story

1013
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:27,871
This story came out in the first week of May but it wasn't the first time this plant made headlines involved in Coronavirus

1014
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:34,271
On April 24th local news report

1015
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,063
Which is prompting them to go ahead

1016
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,087
Test everyone

1017
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
This article implies that they're going to change their strategy testing individuals

1018
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:48,607
You are which would lead one to believe the previously they were only testing people who had symptoms

1019
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,727
These original 16 cases are completely foreign to Alex he has no idea about this part of the story

1020
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,055
Cuz he just saw a headline

1021
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,895
Decided it must be no one sick and look no further into the case than that

1022
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Also

1023
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,527
At least one employee if I plan to test positive for covid-19 is now dead

1024
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,367
What Alex is saying has no connection with reality

1025
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,159
Details he feels like in order to prop up

1026
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
Is predetermined conclusion

1027
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:17,279
With Noah's Espinosa a person would do that if they were interested in the truth

1028
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,071
F****** liar

1029
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,887
And I wish you done cast in Guardians of the Galaxy

1030
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,471
Cuz

1031
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,263
I don't understand

1032
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,287
Like there's got to be

1033
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,103
People Are People culpable

1034
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,967
There's no lawsuits there's no nothing that we can

1035
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:42,367
Can do honey

1036
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,903
I wonder if

1037
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,695
You know I've seen some headlines and

1038
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:49,023
I see a little irresponsible thing this because I haven't looked into them but

1039
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,119
I wonder if one day there will be statistical

1040
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,423
Difference you will be able to find between dab

1041
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,983
People who taken different sorts of media

1042
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:02,591
Having any kind of criminal or civil liability but like

1043
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:06,431
I wonder if one day we will be able to see those trends

1044
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,735
I would be horrified

1045
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
Two man

1046
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,063
It's just there

1047
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,695
There are people who are doing this knowing

1048
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
If you can't

1049
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:24,351
I can't get that thought out of my head people are knowingly choosing

1050
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,399
To watch other people die

1051
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:31,263
And they and they are in a position to do something about it

1052
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,335
Some in fact they're in the position we're in there

1053
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,871
Specifically choosing

1054
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,407
Not to do something about it

1055
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,271
Absolutely culpable tour

1056
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
Some of them may think

1057
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:51,487
Amount of pain caused by the

1058
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,279
Whatever it snapped off

1059
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:59,679
Yep so in this next clip Alex gets into his racist Asian voice in a while

1060
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,959
Do a little bit of that

1061
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,263
China says oh

1062
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,823
Wuhan

1063
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
China Taste

1064
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,583
Bubbles

1065
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,167
I'm going to tell you this right now

1066
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
Vampires

1067
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
Vampires

1068
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,799
We can get people in the government

1069
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
Vampires

1070
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,919
So cowardly

1071
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,903
If you don't have horrible food

1072
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
The New World Order

1073
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
Anteater

1074
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
You're crazy

1075
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,799
We got trouble food ready to ship out

1076
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Cool

1077
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
So

1078
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:20,575
Stration

1079
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:25,183
I wish it was a Galaxy

1080
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
Anniversary

1081
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,303
So we get into the Alex comes back

1082
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:33,375
From break

1083
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,911
The big news

1084
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,751
Is just

1085
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:45,151
The

1086
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
YouTube the news

1087
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
Realizes that he

1088
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,295
Can't get into it because you've got to get in the zone or something

1089
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
Completely focused

1090
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,591
I was I was busy doing some work so I can't do it

1091
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
Get back in the zone

1092
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,431
Are you back in the shower

1093
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
So much

1094
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,695
Anything to make him unprepared

1095
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
Shirley

1096
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
Repair Today Show

1097
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,503
Surprise

1098
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,367
Haha

1099
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,255
I really hope that

1100
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
Eugenicist trying to one-up each other but

1101
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,679
They're going to they're going to carry the shop

1102
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,239
Haha

1103
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,567
Going to get really bad

1104
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,615
False flag

1105
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,271
Thank God and your lucky stars

1106
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
Whatever reason our way

1107
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,855
We're in a relationship

1108
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
These guys worship

1109
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,695
Goddamn

1110
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,535
Cooper.

1111
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:44,447
Dispelling Spade I would tell you about all this but first I got to warn my right-wing Buddies

1112
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:50,847
Probably going to do some terrorism sooner or later

1113
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,951
Back into the zone

1114
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:08,255
He explains exactly

1115
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
You going to do today

1116
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,327
True is massive case

1117
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,631
They're sterile into the vaccine

1118
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
Right now

1119
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,431
Read the headlines and tell you where they came

1120
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
You should do more than

1121
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
Explain to you that

1122
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,111
This year's

1123
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,647
11

1124
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,951
Is my destination

1125
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
At what year

1126
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,839
Available there's 18

1127
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Through 4

1128
01:14:54,591 --> 01:15:00,735
I've kept track of how many gets through and

1129
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,831
At the end of us

1130
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:11,231
This is actually start I thought this was the first example but it's not actually

1131
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
Ben

1132
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,447
1885

1133
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Westphal

1134
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
Woman thing

1135
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,735
All the time

1136
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,783
The pregnancy hormone

1137
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,719
That was the first piece of evidence that the 1985 study

1138
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,767
Google HCG in vaccines

1139
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,839
Sure Indian saree

1140
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:52,447
Was misrepresented by the propaganda

1141
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:57,055
Somebody researching into the idea of a temporary birth control vaccine

1142
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,383
Search ocean scientist name

1143
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Call War

1144
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,295
Continuing his work of trying to produce effective and safe birth control methods

1145
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:10,879
And you changed his name to Stout I'm not sure about that

1146
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:18,047
Implying

1147
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:22,399
But it was about a trial for thanks temporary birth control

1148
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,215
There's literally nothing to do with corn

1149
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:31,359
National Institute of Neurology

1150
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,687
Which kind of sounds close to the entity

1151
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:39,039
The National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases

1152
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,903
Primarily because the nation in question National Institute of Immunology

1153
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,999
So how does

1154
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,583
Prove the connection between towel bars

1155
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,887
1985 study

1156
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,191
I'm not sure

1157
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,983
It's demonstrated

1158
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,311
Immortal has to change his appearance every 50

1159
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
Years in order to keep people from

1160
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,127
Thinking that he is

1161
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,199
Maybe mortal Maybe

1162
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,039
That was the first example

1163
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:16,415
Quit after 1

1164
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,743
HCG

1165
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,791
Learned about and is now exactly

1166
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
HCG gets released from

1167
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
It gets released

1168
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,055
Wayne

1169
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,871
Majestic

1170
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,711
So is it making stuff up

1171
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:44,575
I guess you can make something either related but that is really accurate either

1172
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:47,647
According to hormone. Org

1173
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:52,767
Is produced by the cells that are surrounded growing embryo which eventually forms the placenta

1174
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,399
The ovaries itself do not actually go on to become the

1175
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
Santa

1176
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:05,567
It is true that the pituitary gland also produces a low levels of HCG

1177
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,151
Would normally affect pregnancy

1178
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,967
This is not Taiwan about

1179
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
Fontspace

1180
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,783
Just awesome as well

1181
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:18,623
And I just wanted to point out that you think it comes from your balls

1182
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
So

1183
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,207
Still has not gone down to bed

1184
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
On

1185
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Metrogel

1186
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
Usher's understand that

1187
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,423
Login

1188
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
But I'm begging you for mice

1189
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,359
Let me just show you headlines

1190
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:47,039
E85 thing was the first

1191
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,087
Actually started the clock yet

1192
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
Okay

1193
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:54,719
So Alex getting ready to go

1194
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
This is going to be

1195
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,351
I don't know how long I'm going to play with him

1196
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,191
He's going to serve it up right back in the first one

1197
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
Drumming

1198
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
Cool

1199
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,223
From many years ago

1200
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
It's here now

1201
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:24,415
So this was not from the NIH it's a journal article that's housed on the National Library of Medicine website

1202
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:29,535
Is also at the

1203
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:35,423
It was a 1993 article in the journal annals of Medicine

1204
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:41,823
And it discusses his work in terms of developing control shots even the abstract of this article

1205
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,127
Birth control vaccine he was riding up close

1206
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:47,199
Has previously been demonstrated to be reversible

1207
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:50,271
And it requires a booster every 8 to 9 months

1208
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,599
Article number one has nothing to do with the point

1209
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,879
And does not show that

1210
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,183
Evil Globe luster products

1211
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,231
He is over one alright

1212
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,023
Here's serve to

1213
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,583
Fertility vaccines

1214
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
How they work

1215
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,399
Shell.com

1216
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,239
So this is an April 2002 review article

1217
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,287
In the journal Trends in Immunology

1218
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,336
Posted on sale.com

1219
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,128
This is literally just an article

1220
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:20,736
Discusses recent developments in the field of vaccines

1221
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:21,760
It does nothing

1222
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
Eagle

1223
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:35,328
I guess if that's the argument he's trying to make sure that I don't know if it's birth control is nefarious

1224
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,144
All of these examples start to make sense

1225
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
I'm going to be honest

1226
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:39,936
I think

1227
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,264
That he is not getting into the Articles body

1228
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:49,664
On purpose cuz he doesn't

1229
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,528
But they don't really

1230
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,928
I'm starting to put this all together he's like he's like a Fifth Element coming at at this point

1231
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:08,096
Love you to the third headline

1232
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,168
United States

1233
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
CVS

1234
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,264
Barry Democrat

1235
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
You got to love

1236
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:25,248
So this BBS articles specifically about the programs in the United States is mighty early 1900's that were enacted on non-white

1237
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
Population through the country

1238
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,112
As long as way to redeem code minded or mentally ill

1239
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:36,512
There's also mention of recent days which is all awful

1240
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,584
Connect to all these cases

1241
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,704
Justice wasn't taking self-determination away from the people who are subjected to these programs

1242
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,520
These cases are used to support

1243
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:52,128
The argument that people should have access to all of the Family Planning and reproductive Health Care

1244
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,920
They choose to use which

1245
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,456
Should strongly be against

1246
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,736
Based on what he believed

1247
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,760
I suppose I guess

1248
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:04,160
I guess I don't know

1249
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:10,304
History in our country of this except

1250
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,120
Global staff today

1251
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:19,520
Lies on the kind of thinking basically winking and nudging you saying people do.

1252
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,336
Couple things way in the past probably doing it

1253
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,664
It's a way of trying to insinuate something and then pretend it's proof

1254
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,712
Show me the humans

1255
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:31,808
Americans are capable of a particular evil

1256
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
They are doing it

1257
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:37,184
However it's the kind of evidence

1258
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
Possible

1259
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,744
It's a lord of the BART

1260
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,608
To the point where whatever you proven is ultimately meaningless to the actual conversation

1261
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,400
Alex is over 3

1262
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,704
This doesn't work for what he say

1263
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
That's unfortunate

1264
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,080
So he does make it to 4

1265
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,552
Sweaters he got kicked out

1266
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,856
Problem

1267
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
God dammit

1268
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,976
Do Indian history with sterilization

1269
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:15,072
Sterilization

1270
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:18,144
There's a lot to the picture however

1271
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,680
None of it has to do with pudding

1272
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,960
Sterlington vaccines

1273
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,544
It has to do with things like paying for people to have their tubes tied

1274
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,128
This particular

1275
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
I'm Center

1276
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,992
This is completely unrelated to the point

1277
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,528
The trying to make

1278
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,808
Clearly thought

1279
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,344
Contradicting is imperative

1280
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,416
I thought Bill Gates's posed to been thrown out of the deal because of the

1281
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,208
Back seats for 2,000

1282
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:50,400
All the stuff is internally inconsistent

1283
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,448
They just to make whatever point he feels like

1284
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:56,032
I don't mean to diminish the issue of safe reproductive health

1285
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,056
India at all

1286
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,336
There's definitely question

1287
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,384
In a conversation to be had

1288
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,432
But it has nothing to do with

1289
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
About yours over 4

1290
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:08,320
Unfortunately Euro 41

1291
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,696
Size of the Gates Foundation

1292
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,976
Boiler

1293
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:25,728
It's from many years ago

1294
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,664
Partial control immunization technical support unit

1295
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,480
Which was formerly fully funded by The Gates Foundation

1296
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:43,136
The decision is seen as part of India's broader clampdown on nongovernmental organizations

1297
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,672
Decision making

1298
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
And key policy area

1299
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,608
Last year India ordered the dismissal of dozens of foreign funded Health experts working on public welfare schemes

1300
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,448
Circles entrecote senior health Ministry official soumya

1301
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,496
Swaminathan

1302
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,056
Stressed there were no influence

1303
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:06,432
And the decision was only in perception about foreign funding of program

1304
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,968
Which is to say that

1305
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
Weird

1306
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:12,064
The reason for taking control of some of these

1307
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,904
Was a concern about influenza for people over policy

1308
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,232
But upon review there weren't any actual instances

1309
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:26,656
So after this decision foundation-funded the parts of the itsuno were involved in tracking vaccinations

1310
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,448
Coverage in managing Logistics

1311
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,776
So this is more of a government reorganization than anything else

1312
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,360
If Alex's story were correct in the Indian government made this

1313
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:39,456
Because they found out dates with sterilizing everyone you probably expected they wouldn't

1314
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,272
Retain The Gates Foundation of the partner on vaccinations logistic

1315
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
Management

1316
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:49,184
Are you supposed to been kicked out a country at this point makes no fucken sense I was over 50

1317
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,744
We caught you with the sterilization thing

1318
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
That's our

1319
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:59,168
You stick around with hey we still need that we still need all kinds of other stuff but we're not going to lie to you

1320
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,240
Provide

1321
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,688
Tivity regulating

1322
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,064
Immunotherapeutic vaccines reaching human trials

1323
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,328
Just another article about talloires work on the Earth

1324
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Control shots

1325
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:31,680
6

1326
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:35,264
Also academic

1327
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,128
Is the Oxford academic archives.com

1328
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:46,528
A posting on their Archive of an article from the July 1997 issue of human reproduction update

1329
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,600
How to no idea what he's trying to use

1330
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,392
Pointy completely doesn't understand

1331
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,440
This is so pathetic

1332
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,488
This is this is really just hard

1333
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:03,424
This is a real bummer when they actually try and prove their point

1334
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,800
World Health Organization

1335
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,080
None of this

1336
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,920
Forget the number 7

1337
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,088
Population Research Institute

1338
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,440
Read All About It

1339
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:31,328
Sprouts doesn't even offer a citation investigation by the population

1340
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:35,680
I don't care about this Outlet run by Steven Mosher

1341
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:43,104
Unless whatever is in that report is being substantiated by someone who is not the time of day

1342
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,152
It's not even worth it

1343
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,176
But he does

1344
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
Number 8

1345
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,016
Another one

1346
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:56,672
Dial feels like he's not even trying

1347
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,792
Control shots

1348
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,960
Development

1349
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,800
Reproduction World Health Organization

1350
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,568
Switzerland

1351
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,600
Okay

1352
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:32,000
The fact that the World Health Organization as a part of it that's dedicated to reproductive and it's some other interest might involve

1353
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,560
Control

1354
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,608
That makes total sense

1355
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:42,240
Anything specific

1356
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,312
I can't really just prove anything here cuz there's nothing to just Brew

1357
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,848
How to overnight

1358
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:52,224
I do like that it seems like he's forgotten that we're watching

1359
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,272
Just sitting in Titans like he's in

1360
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,344
Stable just looking at the paper

1361
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,464
Look at what they did today Lucky Charms

1362
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,048
Supposed to be in Guardians of the Galaxy

1363
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,680
Double-digit

1364
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,056
Medical journal

1365
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
What's the main one

1366
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:29,856
Get the f*** out of here at all

1367
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:33,952
Backlash in India surrounding Research into birth control vaccine

1368
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:39,328
Confirm 1998 has nothing to do with anything other than opposition to birth

1369
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,864
Control the shop

1370
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:47,520
Alex's weaving HPV and for some reason probably just because he wants to make it sound more damning or something but

1371
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,312
Until 2000

1372
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,640
608 years after this Lancet article came out

1373
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:56,480
Birth control in opposition to birth control

1374
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,016
2.8 / 10

1375
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,320
Yeah let's try again here we go

1376
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,704
Alright you got me

1377
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:24,896
Fertility vaccine options

1378
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,944
Just now it's posted on sciencedirect.

1379
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,296
The same Source multiple times

1380
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:43,840
1989 and it's just an article in the journal vaccine

1381
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,376
Work on birth control

1382
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:49,472
We're talking about you do for 11

1383
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Impressive

1384
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,056
This is kind of a

1385
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,104
In a certain way

1386
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:02,272
Impressed by sloppiness

1387
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:08,672
You hit one right of the

1388
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:11,232
Number 12

1389
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,072
Sterilizing you

1390
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:24,800
What I have no idea what I was talking about and I don't care

1391
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:27,360
I don't give a s***

1392
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,152
I can't possibly imagine

1393
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:35,552
Cassidy

1394
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,232
Bad for your balls

1395
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:48,352
That's where we're at number 13, radar

1396
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,752
Snopes

1397
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:55,776
Yes

1398
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,456
$10

1399
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:09,600
Open Access Library Journal paper

1400
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:18,048
Wow would you be surprised to learn that we get to 14

1401
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,608
This Sunday

1402
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:34,432
So this article claims clinical trial of tetanus vaccine

1403
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:37,760
Which was announced in the journal Nature medicine

1404
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:44,160
There's no link to the nature medicine article

1405
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:47,232
It's the same thing about the birth control vaccine

1406
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
His backbone is

1407
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,072
The carrier the same misunderstanding misrepresentation

1408
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:57,472
In this Sunday Guardian article

1409
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:01,056
Stop reporting erroneous

1410
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:04,896
Particularly

1411
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,944
414

1412
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,968
And that's where we at

1413
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:09,760
Yeah you made it to 14

1414
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:13,856
4918 is way better than

1415
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:18,208
Obviously I was betting on

1416
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:26,656
Never will know what those other four were

1417
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,728
Other members of the 12 that will never know

1418
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
There's layers here

1419
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:36,128
What's 4 + 4 - 2 exactly

1420
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:39,200
Yeah so I was unimpressed

1421
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:45,856
About birth control shot

1422
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:52,512
They were in development over the years

1423
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:58,912
Mars research

1424
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,312
These birth control

1425
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:11,712
We keep coming up like in 97 2002

1426
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,272
A lot of them do end up facing back to

1427
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,576
His research

1428
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,880
Is Alex trying to make this argument

1429
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,928
Obelisks are putting

1430
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:23,744
Sterilant in vaccine

1431
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,304
None of this demonstrates that anyway

1432
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,608
But of course he thinks he's proven his point

1433
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:33,728
Yeah I mean if you didn't if you're just passively paying not paying attention

1434
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
With him saying

1435
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,056
Anti-fertility vaccine

1436
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,080
You might get the

1437
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:43,712
Vaccine

1438
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:48,832
And that's not at all what's going on there

1439
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,648
Could be taking a lot of different ways by people

1440
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,928
And that's what he's thinking

1441
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:57,792
Is it banking on people not paying attention being a guy

1442
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,376
These people have got

1443
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,400
So nuts

1444
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,168
What's that

1445
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,448
It appears like

1446
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,496
We're like

1447
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:11,872
Professional people are studying them like they're a different subspecies like

1448
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:14,688
Just like there's cellulitis

1449
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
Where are these people coming from

1450
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:28,256
Unrecognizable see people

1451
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,816
Messages from people about

1452
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,352
People they know who

1453
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:35,424
You'll fall into the u.s.

1454
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:40,544
I would have a very difficult time believing

1455
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,872
Yeah it's really is becoming like a

1456
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,688
Something happened

1457
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,992
Like the internet

1458
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,272
People up to such an

1459
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:53,344
Text Ed 911

1460
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,904

1461

18

1463
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,120
It comes back and he's got a message

Trump

1465
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,192
A message for Bill Gates

1466
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,472
He doesn't get to the message

1467
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,496
Search for Trump

1468
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
I'm not sure what is nice

1469
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:17,920
Bill Gates's other than event

01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,760
Hard right awful folks

1511
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:08,416
They generally are beholden to some sort of thing that will stop them from

Make his own podcast

1513
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,400

It is free it is really free

1520
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,232
It's not a positive

1521
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:47,328
He wants to f*** around and do the world's worst proof

1522
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:53,728
Ever he can do that

1523
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,360
Can't Stop

1524
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,384

1526
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:08,576

1530
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:19,072
Focus 2

1531
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,120
Doesn't want offensive viola

1532
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,168
But

1533
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:23,936
But

1534
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,496
Lester to do any

1535
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
Offensive

1536
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,360
Has

1537
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,640
Common sense

1538
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
Turn it into

1539
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,880
Not cuz people will die

1540
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
Rain

1541
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
Cannot be turned off

1542
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,120
You claim your this

1543
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,424
You're not a coward

1544
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:02,080
Sterilize you and your family

1545
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,688
All these media people are going along with it

1546
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,248
Looking for a fight

1547
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:15,648
Here's the thing

1548
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,488
Consistent talking about how he doesn't want all senses violin

1549
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,768
And yet

1550
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,536
He does

1551
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,816
All of these things

1552
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,608
In order to make the argument

1553
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,144
Pretty explicit

1554
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,288
Yeah these are coming at you with these needles

1555
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,384
Otherwise you going to kill you in a month if you don't act

1556
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,712
Is directional encouraged

1557
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,760
People to engage in these acts of violence

1558
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,856
Probably

1559
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,136
Terrorist attack

1560
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:50,464

1561
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,744
Defensive cuz they wanted

1562
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,424
But he's not

1563
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,704
Encouraging

1564
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,240
Terror

1565
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,824
So

1566
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,592
Great

1567
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:09,408
In service of the government murdering people

1568
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,480
Interesting it is weird

1569
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,504
Sing

1570
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,344
Version of self defense is murdering people because

1571
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:21,696
But then the larger government is on his

1572
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:27,328
We're weird we proved vaccines.

1573
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,120
Says as much here

1574
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,912

Also stupid

1583
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,984
That is not good

1584
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:12,896

01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,560
Going to get arrested for

1660
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,096
IC rise

1661
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,376
It was

1662
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:57,728
Report where he did his character

1663
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:01,312
You had a different ideas remember you said it was

1664
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:07,712
You said it was like send someone down there to yell China virus

1665
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,736
Thought you were correct

1666
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:15,392
Antonio

1667
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:33,312
China virus into a bullhorn

1668
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,384
Prove

1669
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,552
The f*** you that

1670
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:55,584
Yeah it's very weird

1671
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:03,776
Little bit

1672
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,080
So if there's any way forward without

1673
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
War

1674
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
You believe that

1675
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
Possibility

1676
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:12,224
Having a

1677
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:12,992
Resin

1678
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,552
Platform without actually

1679
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
Ghost

1680
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,344
Do some kind

1681
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,624
War over the

1682
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:22,464
We're talkin about your we're going to be completely taken off everything

1683
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,024
Definition

1684
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,048
What about tequila

1685
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
But that

1686
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,704
More and more

1687
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:40,128
In today's world violent crime victim on anyone anytime

1688
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:46,528
Cut off my break

1689
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:49,600
Birds of the government already

1690
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:51,648
That's true but a third nipple

1691
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:56,000
That's fair we're going to have to go to Ward's house

1692
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:56,768
No it's

1693
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,048
Get on Facebook

1694
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,840
Twitter that's what matters

1695
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:02,400
I am I mean

1696
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,936
It's not good

1697
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,984
To talk to your audience

1698
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,312
Maybe not the most critical minded Folk

1699
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:13,408
Sprite and

1700
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,432
And your answer is no

1701
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:20,832
Because when you already sort of laid out of violence of being defensive

1702
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:26,976
Stopping you from a

1703
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:29,792
Like sort of reasoning perspective like what's the difference

1704
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,328
Between that and advocating

1705
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,864
You got to do something

1706
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,656
Do you want

1707
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:37,472
You want to be starved out until the robot

1708
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,776
What are you going to do

1709
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,848
I messed up the message that comes forth pretty clearly

1710
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:43,872
From Alex

1711
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:46,176
Is there anything we could do to stop a war

1712
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,712
Listen to your neighbors

1713
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:53,856
Okay cuz there anything else we could do to stop a war you know I rest now

1714
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:02,048
F***** up

1715
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,144
Run around

1716
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,520
The mayor

1717
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
Police

1718
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:24,320
Alex wants the police department's to take over overthrow mayors

1719
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,368
The

1720
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,648
I do like that sister

1721
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:38,400
Alex and I got fired from my job as a cop

1722
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:41,472
Well I guess you're the new bear those are the rules

1723
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,264
Unacceptable

1724
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,568
Cops

1725
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:51,968
Cop should take over the mayorship

1726
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,760
Guy and like a cop was like

1727
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:57,344
Your dad

1728
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,928
And then that creates an endless circle of different cops

1729
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:02,976
Becoming mayor on a day-to-day basis

1730
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:09,632
Fire

1731
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:15,264
I think it's taking over

1732
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:20,128
Okay well I mean essentially militarized police

1733
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,688
Committing is bad

1734
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:28,064
Technically be sort of the form of martial law

1735
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,856
Military

1736
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:33,696
Results

1737
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,256
Right red heart

1738
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:42,656
I have not heard on before

1739
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,936
And the sound is terrible

1740
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,728
So I apologize for that in advance

1741
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:49,312
Giphy.com

1742
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:54,688
Another meeting is a really active fellow

1743
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:57,760
Great job

1744
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:02,880
Sounded so there's something wrong with their audio

1745
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:08,000
Yippee

1746
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:09,536
A guy named Rich Granville

1747
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:16,192
Because in the past

1748
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:20,032
Recorded on the soldiers confer

1749
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:23,616
Prince which was organized by

1750
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:25,152
A big chew promoters

1751
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,688
Bill

1752
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:31,808
The website promoting with the Stars rearranged to make a

1753
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,576
Accu

1754
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,560
Conspiracy theory

1755
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:49,216
Rich also described his company UPS intelligence Enterprise

1756
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,080
You probably warned him quotes

1757
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,872
You don't know who your f****** with

1758
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:02,528
This was probably because

1759
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,320
From the article

1760
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:06,624
I don't give a f*** about the Deep State he said

1761
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,232
If I could I would shoot them in the head

1762
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,768
Because that's illegal

1763
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:18,912
At one point during the conversation Granville abruptly asserted that his IQ is 172

1764
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,680
Why not

1765
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,704
Why not

1766
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:23,008
Why not

1767
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:29,408
Dan the people most likely to scream at you for disrespecting the flag would love to turn it in

1768
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,272
Yep cool due to the Q profiteering weirdo

1769
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:40,928
If you remember the c-pack episode that we did was trying to promote

1770
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,208
Turn to give a speech

1771
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:45,024
If I understand the situation correctly

1772
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,328
Jpr big Flynn fundraiser

1773
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:53,472
Soldiers whatever

1774
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,520
Explain the whole lot

1775
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:59,616
It explains why Mike Flynn Jr was at the Sea-Tac in that to begin with

1776
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:03,968
Hang out with the guy

1777
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:10,624
And now maybe they're sponsoring our to show but probably not I mean

1778
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,160
Money even if you're a weirdo

1779
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:15,488
But understand return

1780
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,584
How do I look up eclipse of this guy being a real suck head

1781
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,376
I think the United States

1782
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:23,936
Get through this done right now

1783
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,472
Really

1784
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:26,752
Broken

1785
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:30,592
So the only way we're going to get through this

1786
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:36,480
Superiority that no one else can even get

1787
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,040
They're still mad because he's so smart

1788
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,320
Yeah that makes sense

1789
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:44,160
God-ordained

1790
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:46,208
Or whatever

1791
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:50,816
President

1792
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:54,912
Two-term limit

1793
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:55,680
Or did I

1794
01:56:58,752 --> 01:56:59,264
2BR

1795
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,080
That is

1796
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:07,968
Translate all the way down to his family I got

1797
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:12,576
Obama

1798
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,648
All right here we go

1799
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:23,840
I can't do an internal hybrid Kings

1800
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,936
He is super against King

1801
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,216
Dedicated

1802
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:34,336
Toothless and I care so much about the Second Amendment I will just throw away the entire concert

1803
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,664
Just have the Second Amendment and I want a cake

1804
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:44,064
Yeah I mean

1805
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,928
Even if he believed in the same person

1806
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,768
King

1807
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:57,376
F*** off my shell-like let's

1808
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:59,424
You know it's 2000

1809
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,192
12

1810
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,520
I'm doing

1811
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,568
I don't even know what that would look like

1812
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,360
Supporter

1813
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:11,200
I think he's great I prove that he's in the office I think he's doing a lot of great things

1814
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:11,968
Country

1815
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:18,368
I have some crazy person on and they're like Obama was sent by God and is our King I can't talk to you anymore

1816
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:20,928
You are you are you

1817
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:26,304
Start crying talking about how

1818
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,864
The prayers of hundreds of years ago

1819
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:31,424
They are so out

1820
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:34,496
I just I just wish that we were better able to come

1821
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:36,032
Are these people

1822
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,080
Underneath so much of this s*** is that

1823
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,360
I kind of idea of

1824
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:42,688
And I say I do maintain the theory that it's because the right wing

1825
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:47,552
Push the idea that Obama was a dictator

1826
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:51,136
Inadvertently created a right-wing bed

1827
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,160
Didn't

1828
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:55,488
Think that dictators were bad they just wanted their own dictator

1829
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,728
If that's if you're if you're insisting that the

1830
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:09,056
Dictator it and you're one of these right-wing

1831
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,848
Am I legit really change that much

1832
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,128
You know I guess

1833
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:16,736
I guess one way you could deal with that is be like

1834
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:19,040
Or you could go the way you're describing be like

1835
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:24,672
Yeah I don't know either

1836
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:28,512
Conclusion consciously but maybe on some subconscious level

1837
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:31,840
Thought maybe you should do some research on it

1838
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,424
I don't know why

1839
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,960
The combination of

1840
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,752
Maybe something you're talkin about

1841
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:42,592
Obsession to strongman leadership

1842
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:45,920
Perversion of individualism

1843
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:48,736
Whatever it is like this is what it comes to

1844
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:50,016
And you got a guy

1845
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,040
Here

1846
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,064
And Alex

1847
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:57,696
Sitting around talking about the goddess ordaining Trump to be our King there's nothing more

1848
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:00,256
Submitting yourself

1849
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:03,840
Separate yourself

1850
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,144
And become an individual is by

1851
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,216
So these people are

1852
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,240
Looking sad

1853
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:16,128
Alberto's saddened that they're winning

1854
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:16,896
Yippee guy

1855
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:20,480
Yippee ki-yay

1856
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,808
They worship the devil

1857
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,136
Cruise

1858
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:30,464
If they're falling Luther

1859
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,256
Then Christ must

1860
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,024
Be real as well

1861
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:34,816
Right

1862
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,608
There's your

1863
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,912
That is a

1864
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,984
Very bad level

1865
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:48,384
70 Stanley

1866
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:52,480
If the globalist do worship the devil

1867
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:55,296
That doesn't prove the devil's existence

1868
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:57,344
No it doesn't

1869
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,136
Is the Devil exist

1870
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:01,440
That doesn't prove God's account

1871
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:05,280
Bourbon God's existence doesn't necessarily prove

1872
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,560
Existence

1873
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:11,168
Necessarily through it

1874
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:13,728
Just oh my God this level of thinking just

1875
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:17,056
I'm sorry guy

1876
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,592
I don't even care

1877
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:25,248
I'm glad you were able to run a search engine check it out

1878
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
Bring it to the table

1879
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,552
God-ordained

1880
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:32,160
King and because the globalist worship the devil that prove God's real

1881
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:34,208
I got nothing for you and I got to go

1882
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:38,304
Create some sort of stronger

1883
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,912
Way to deal with these people because right now it seems like all we're doing is just going

1884
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,240
Again

1885
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:49,312
She funded them on Twitter and doing all that s*** and there's

1886
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:51,872
So many opinion pieces written in LA

1887
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:54,176
There needs to be some sort of United

1888
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:59,040
It can't be we can't allow them

1889
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:02,368
Threatened everybody with violence while we mock them on Twitter

1890
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:05,696
Yeah I don't know that

1891
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,512
Anything that you can do would really be effective

1892
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:10,304
Unless we first deal with

1893
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:13,376
A shared reality

1894
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:17,216
Like there's no real way to deal with anything

1895
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:21,312
While realities are so distinct from each other that

1896
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:25,408
Alex can do that reading 14 headlines instead of 18 is brahmas

1897
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:30,784
I'm thinking very proves the point

1898
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,112
Nothing I could do nothing nothing conversation

1899
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,648
Could possibly

1900
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:37,184
Make a difference

1901
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:41,280
That was different reality until those reality

1902
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,304
We come to a

1903
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,608
Sentence of what is and what isn't real

1904
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:51,008
What parts of things that I don't believe are real but you might acceptable for us to disagree

1905
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:55,104
Like let's say I'm an atheist in your someone who believes

1906
02:02:55,360 --> 02:03:01,504
In Christianity perfectly acceptable for me to not believe in the reality of something

1907
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,528
Can you believe is real

1908
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,552
And Ice Cube

1909
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:06,368
Be okay with that and move along in our lives

1910
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:09,440
Bashar reality doesn't have to extend to everything

1911
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:17,120
Arterra place right now where everyone shares the same

1912
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:23,776
The issues that you're bringing up I don't think he'll be dealt with until we do occasionally

1913
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:28,384
Critical thinking skills any of those are important

1914
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,200
Any good helpful

1915
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:34,016
Hopefully if you were to

1916
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:38,112
Tackle some of those problems and work on them to an extent

1917
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:40,160
I think maybe it would help

1918
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:42,976
In making people understand shared reality

1919
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:47,328
But until until that's more dressed I just don't know what you can do

1920
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:52,960
A now there'll be some people who cares whatever he does eat grapes

1921
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,752
That's really sad

1922
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,288
Sad but

1923
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,848
Jordan the end of the day

1924
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:02,176
We can all take pleasure in knowing that Alex is almost

1925
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:05,248
Star-Lord

1926
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:11,648
Emotionally vulnerable as well

1927
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:16,000
Actor is the way he's able to tap into all of those feelings

1928
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:21,376
The capacity for growth is really clear an hour

1929
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:24,192
Another one

1930
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:31,104
Abruptly tomorrow and go away for a month and never come back or whatever

1931
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,456
That moment you realize you was talking about

1932
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,696
Because I was going through

1933
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:52,096
2001 A Space Odyssey

1934
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,888
He's like Kurt Russell

1935
02:04:54,656 --> 02:05:00,800
That is not real that is unreal it's amazing thank you

1936
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,824

1937
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:06,432

02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,400
You are correct

02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:31,776
Headline 15 through 18

1944
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:36,896
