1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448

00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody dance

00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
Dan

6
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Is there a

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Jingle you remember

8
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,032
Set a reminder Android

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,896
Oh really that's kind of O'Reilly Auto Parts

10
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,248
Oh oh oh O'Reilly Auto Parts

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
O'Reilly Auto Parts

12
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,112
It's just a divorce gone bad and she

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
She made her own business

14
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
Variety

15
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,632
Auto

16
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
She was like

17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
F****** hate that

18
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
She just made O'Reilly Auto

19
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
I feel really fairly certain that I could be wrong

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
But I remember that we wish it was more of a local thing but I honestly also I realized that I had sort of Plaistow

21
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,648
Auto Parts in my brain as like a local Columbia business

22
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:09,024
AutoZone

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Yeah

24
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
That's the that's the one that's

25
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:18,752
Sticks out most to be but I'm sure there are others

26
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,104
Well I just turned and looked over and you got goldfish right

27
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,968
So I do remember that

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,344
Watch PBS grown-ups have a lot of commercials

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Myerly days

30
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Mitsuba

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Even think they would allow that

32
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Jingles but Alex Jones

33
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
About the farmer and not about the law

34
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,080
Over April 8th

35
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,664
Teeth 2013 alright continuing are

36
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Barger coverage

37
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
Alex's responds to Sandy Hook and its coverage afterwards

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
In the subchapter the

39
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
The Boston bombing

40
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Fallout

41
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,816
I'm starting to realize is that maybe

42
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
What we were looking for was the wrong thing

43
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,984
Yeah where we embarked on was trying to figure out when Alex changes

44
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Your story is the Boston bombing broke his mind

45
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Hold on to

46
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
Pretty solid evidence that this is a

47
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,576
Major turning point

48
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
Career

49
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
He believes like we talked about on our last episode

50
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
He has

51
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
Completely outflank

52
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Continues to lose

53
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,168
And we're going to go through a good bit of that

54
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
Things get wild

55
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
Before we get to that we got to give a shout out

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288

00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312

This ad

64
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,464

70
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
I'm a policy wonk

4000

72
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Maybe better than

73
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Arabic

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935
Lastly I'm probably going to miss

75
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Is it pronounced

76
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
It's a cake AME

00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
K

78
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
I'm going to say

79
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Acme

80
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
I feel like we're getting

81
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
Impossible

82
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Thank you so much

83
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,303
And

84
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
The button to support the show

85
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
Go to our patreon

86
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Portraiture

87
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Okay

88
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Let me read my

89
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Introduction

90
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,295
No they have on your your alert

91
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
For the final time I will introduce.

92
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
On the 18th

93
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
People do not know very much

94
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,351
This is the episode right before what I'm going to call the fever break

95
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,727
And it's the last episode where Alex has legitimate free rein to create whatever story he want

96
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Out of the random bits of Internet rumors

97
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
But he can find

98
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
To recap a little bit

99
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,919
On our last installment Alex's found some out of context images on

100
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
4chan

101
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,527
And use them to create his own story of what happened at the Boston Marathon

102
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,391
He found people in the pictures that he felt fit his narrative and cast them like characters in a play

103
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,767
He saw some guys and we decided we're still uniform so they were they were buried

104
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
He saw a white guy but he felt looked

105
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
Stupid holding a backpack

106
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
Who the globalist

107
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
They're going to pin the crime on the

108
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Barrett

109
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
He saw some guy was Brown.

110
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
The media is obsessed with the idea of white right when is working with Al-Qaeda

111
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Which makes

112
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
All of this was just made up out of whole cloth

113
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,231
None of this was in any way based on anything other than Alex

114
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Astoria

115
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
He came up with wild looking

116
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Random photo

117
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,655
From there Alex decided he'd scoop

118
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:10,079
Forced to announce that the FBI had photos of the suspects because he reported on those pictures then again he found on

119
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Unfortunate

120
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
After that point Alex descended into

121
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,063
A completely delusional state where you believe that the globalists were watching his every move and trying to counter in through the media

122
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,415
He was in a state of Open Season

123
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
And advocated lone actors attack the Federal

124
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
It was a f*****-up under any

125
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Particularly

126
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Yeah that one was wild

127
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
I assume that

128
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,263
Is much better and they retract all of that b******* today

129
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,823
Let me see all of them don't know if they do okay

130
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
They denounced

131
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
But they had photos of the

132
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,879
Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano testified before the house Homeland

133
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
Security committee regarding these images and videos

134
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
However

135
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
The actual images had not yet been released to the public when Alex

136
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
And then another media Outlet made a gigantic

137
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,127
The New York Post put a picture of two men to Moroccan gentleman who had nothing to do with the body

138
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
On their front cover with the title

139
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
New York Post they were operating off old tips

140
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Law

141
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
Hood for a moment consider them Persons of Interest

142
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
But it already excluded them as having

143
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Anything to do with

144
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
The bombing

145
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
This is a huge problem

146
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
New York Post

147
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Discover on the

148
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
The New York Post

149
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Nulo

150
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Others described it as a

151
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Appalling

152
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
They were all right

153
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,103
In the ensuing Fallout it was easy to conflate the two events

154
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
Send your head to imagine the picture on the cover of the New York Post

155
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,063
Was the same one as the ones that we're going to be released by the FBI and it been mentioned by Napolitano

156
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Exactly this mistake

157
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Which will discuss in greater

158
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Detail azathoth

159
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,535
The larger point for now is that when Alex

160
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
He has a lot of chaos into

161
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
Infusion to play with regarding

162
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631
These photos

163
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
In the absence of any real actual information

164
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
He could hope for

165
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,847
At this point

166
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Sure

167
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
The FBI press conference

168
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
Is scheduled to happen while Alex is

169
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
Because he's extended his show 6 hours

170
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
He knows that once the press conference happen

171
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
He needs to be firmly in place with his narrative

172
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,743
He knows that that's the moment that the metaphorical cement

173
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Is going to dry

174
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
Once there's information backed up by an actual investigation available

175
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
His rambling bullshits going to be pretty unconvincing

176
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
To anyone he hasn't already

177
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Solidify the narrative

178
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
2

179
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
Establish a narrative about what the FBI release

180
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Will be

181
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
In hopes of preemptively discrediting

182
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
M3

183
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Throw conspiracies

184
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Spaghetti against the wall

185
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
And see what sticks

186
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
And four of course

187
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
Salt the water before you put

188
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
That otherwise helps it stick

189
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
Also in this episode will premiere of an Infowars

190
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
Yeah

191
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
Someone I've never heard on the show before but I I

192
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Actually talk

193
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
Weird

194
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
We're in here

195
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
It's on air

196
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
It's going to be

197
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
So here's the first Clipper Alex

198
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
What's the disorder

199
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
That

200
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Talking about

201
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
The pictures

202
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
The FBI

203
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
People like Jack Napolitano

204
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Talk about these pictures

205
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
They're just

206
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Cover up

207
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Because

208
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Infowars

209
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
So on this

210
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,703
And

211
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
Completely

212
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
There's

213
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,479
When we show the photos

214
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,391
It's just a distillation of what

215
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
He's watching off on the

216
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Claire like

217
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Legitimate

218
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
This isn't

219
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,007
Yeah absolutely

220
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,103
You got to chase him with a butterfly net or anything like that

221
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,431
It's a balance.

222
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Details

223
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Is sincere

224
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
Buying his own bulshit

225
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
And if some of it is intentional

226
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
Ralliart

227
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
Exact ratio but yeah he buys

228
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
He thinks he's

229
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Really scooped

230
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,655
The real media cuz he's so excited because he's literally never done that

231
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,871
I finally lived up to my promise

232
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
What years

233
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
What we talked about a little bit

234
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Episode

235
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Announcement

236
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Giraffes

237
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
That was inaccurate

238
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,255
Never came from the Boston Police Department the FBI

239
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
It was something that was

240
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
From

241
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Erroneous sources

242
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Within

243
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
The

244
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Text Tiana right

245
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,031
The ideas

246
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
You can you are right that was missed

247
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
Reported

248
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Claim all of this

249
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,039
Because you running the Patsy operation

250
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
It's true it stretches credulity to imagine

251
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
That they're able to do that

252
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,303
I understand that the media is the present

253
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
So much deeper

254
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Anyway

255
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Amigos MSNBC

256
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
That's a surprise

257
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
I see that's the twist ending

258
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
Black Mirror episodes

259
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
BC all along

260
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
Watch that show

261
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
Cork from the night before

262
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
And that is about Obama

263
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Bulshit

264
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
That will kind of continue

265
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
On the prior episode

266
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,815
76ers

267
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
North African

Direct Connect in Saudi Arabia

269
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Talk going around

270
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,967
Stanmore is coming out today

271
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
Schedule

272
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
Call Porsche sedan

273
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,583
For the sake of Oz Trails off in the middle of a sentence

274
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Intentionally

275
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,679
Keep trying to make it look like he doesn't he does not finish his thought

276
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
It just stopped

277
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,871
This is something that's easy to misrepresent

278
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
But I don't think it has anything

279
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
To do with the bombing at all

280
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
At this point

281
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,599
With leaders from around the middle east region

282
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
What's the situation with A-Rod

283
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
As well as the civil war in Syria

284
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,535
He did meet with the Saudi foreign minister Saud al-faisal

285
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
Find a story in The Times of Israel from April 7

286
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
20th 2013 Obama meeting with the Crown Prince

287
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
UAE

288
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
Mansions that Obama planned to meet with the leaders from

289
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Qatar and Jordan

290
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
In the coming week

291

Arawn

292
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
The Civil War

293
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,575
The other meetings with foreign leaders were largely ignored by folks like Alex

294
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
The right-wing media because they didn't have a connection

295
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
There was already a quote on quote

296
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
Anomaly

297
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
With the bombing Saudi Arabia

298
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Is the animator

299
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Liza

300
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Sure

301
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
Are bunch of a couple times so far in our Boston bombing coverage how there was a Saudi national questioned it after

302
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
The attack

303
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,455
And how the media been asking questions about whether or not this individual

304
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Connection with what happened

305
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
And he been totally cleared

306
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
No problem

307
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
You know he wasn't

308
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
Involved he was injured in the bombing

309
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Crown Prince

310
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
MBS

311
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
Would go on to cause a lot more

312
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
Talk about the national anthem

313
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Look

314
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,615
Has largely ignored this story up to this

315
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,455
Reporting on this.

316
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
Hospital

317
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
When they founded

318
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
After he's been injured

319
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,135
Now Alex is picking up

320
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
That was a student who is questioned by the police

321
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
He was never thought to be guilty

322
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Never came up

323
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
Outside of Gossip Mills

324
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,519
Reporting which ended up finding its way into the mouth of one

325
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
Questioning

326
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Indiana Homeland Security committee

327
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
Because if you elect a Republican

328
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Can your diamonds

329
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,063
This dude was actually injured in the bombing person whose question

330
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Attention

331
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,927
Patient directed his way with probably grasping

332
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
It's Rasta cover story

333
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
But they had no real information

334
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,839
On May 24th 2013 Washington Post

335
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
Reported that the Saudi students

336
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
His first public

337
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
Covering an interview that he did with the Islamic month

338
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
He told them quote he is

339
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Continue to receive death threats

340
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,455
Send hate mail to the degree that he has not moved back to his house or resume his normal life

341
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
In his words

342
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Discussing being at the hospital while being questioned

343
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Quote

344
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
They were really scared of me

345
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
I'm injured

346
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
I don't have anything and they asked me what do you have in your hand

347
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
All the police officers in the FBI and all the nurses

348
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Doctors were staring at

349
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,143
I was looking at them like is it because of the color of my skin or is it because of the name of my country

350
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Yes

351
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
To both

352
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:51,103
Media and cupboards so suspiciously

353
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
It is a part of the Saudi cover up

354
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
His life got derailed

355
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
I don't know if I'm going to continue my studies

356
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
I came in to study my bachelor's

357
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
I have a full scholarship

358
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
My country

359
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
I don't know if I'm going to be safe from other people

360
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Because I lost my privacy

361
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
So that's why I'm really scared

362
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
So it's not an easy thing to

363
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Forget

364
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Simultaneous

365
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,375
As in mass

366
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,471
The chusetts by ice on an administrative immigration violation

367
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,567
Because they were in the country to go to school and had not registered for class

368
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
This is a completely different person

369
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,199
The situation was 100% unrelated to the bombing

370
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
But the right-wing media hurts. He's student

371
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,087
Twice and just assumed that they couldn't be more than one Saudi

372
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,391
In the school in the Boston area

373
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Pitstop person

374
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
To survive

375
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,607
I would like to I would like him to survive with better critical thinking

376
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Like

377
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
Like really like we kind of

378
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
There are so many big schools around Boston

379
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:56,383
There's Boston University Boston College Harvard Emerson MIT Northeastern University

380
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Tons more

381
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Pretty sure I just heard

382
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
College

383
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,855
There a lot of Saudi Arabian students in the US to pursue a degree scholarships

384
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,975
The program provides students with free tuition covers their living expenses and even pays for a trip

385
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
Saudi Arabia to VIs

386
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,351
According to the association of international

387
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
In 2012 the United States record numbers of Saudi Arabian students enrolled in academic

388
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Institutions around

389
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Backcountry

390
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,431
The number cited for the 2012 2013 school year The Chronicle of Higher Education is 107,000

391
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Saudi Arabians

392
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Enrolled in US College

393
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Can't believe 107,000

394
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Did the Boston bombing

395
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
How did they all keep it a secret for college factual

396
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
To help prospective students determine which school is best for them

397
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,679
Three schools in the Boston area in the top 10

398
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
A perspective

399
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
From Saudi Arabia

400
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,311
Northeastern University's number to Boston University's number 3

401
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
And Harvard is number seven

402
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
What are the qualifications

403
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Recite YouTube

404
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
Turn the rankings was quote the presence of students

405
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
From Saudi Arabia

406
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
On campus

407
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
There were large numbers of Saudi Arabians

408
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
In the region at

409
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
These colleges

410
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:16,255
And this one being injured in the Boston bombing and one failing to register for classes makes total sense

411
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
I probably went too far in looking into this

412
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Particular detail

413
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
I think it's important

414
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
To clearly show how unfounded in

415
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,703
Stupid assumption

416
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
Being made here about this that this is the same person

417
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
A student who is question

418
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,151
Who was taken in by ice for administrative violation

419
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
I can't

420
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Anytime

421
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Historically where the mob

422
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
So this is a

423
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,343
I just want to point out the Giza

424
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
These right-wing narratives are being built on

425
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,999
And their absurd if you take any kind of close analysis

426
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
Like you really look at what's being

427
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,887
Put

428
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
The guy questioning her in the whole night

429
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,543
Committee

430
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
Deporting this person even if they're not us

431
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
Information about the bomb

432
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
And she's

433
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,527
They're obviously not talking about the porting the guy who was questioned

434
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
There's so many inaccuracies in that question I'm not even going to answer that

435
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
Ava Roberts

436
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
Excuse me

437
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
I would like to say

438
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
To be great

439
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Senator from the

440
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Montana

441
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
You're fuking idiot

442
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Shut up

443
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,056
So Alex gets around bragging

444
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
Because

445
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Through his efforts

446
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Brew

447
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
I don't know

448
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
Sending Dan badonde out to harass people at the

449
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
These press conferences

450
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Datura

451
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
False flag

452
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Become a very high Google

453
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,584
But this isn't

454
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
Memorial service

455
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,352
There's a certain irony to Alex saying that these people who are public servants

456
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:33,216
Trying to inform the public

457
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Bye

458
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
My certa trademarked Google trending

459
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
And we had

460
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Yes

461
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Straight

462
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
If you like that

463
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Episode of navel

464
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,072
He's accusing the governor of Boston

465
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,144
Crass

466
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Infowars app

467
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
They will let your resume

468
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
If it fits disqualify

469
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,456
So the night before

470
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
There was an explosion

471
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Interesting

472
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Alex's

473
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Covering it

474
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Because

475
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
You think

476
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
It would be the biggest

477
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
Doesn't

478
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Don't seem to cover it that much

479
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
Dismissiveness

480
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Approached

481
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
But if you're paying attention

482
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,016
It's very much a like he thinks that this is a false flag

483
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,624
But he's pretending like it's so obvious

484
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Itsblitzzz

485
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,448
Fertilizer Factory

486
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,752
Explain

487
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,128
Coming out

488
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Incidentally there's a big

489
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,576
Spell

490
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,160
Exploding

491
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,280
Important

492
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
The magnitude

493
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,776
Undoubtedly is the culmination of 18 years of my work

494
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
This is my career

495
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,152
Got to focus got to focus on this one

496
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm finally right for the first time I know for sure that the fertilizer Factory was a fertilizer at all

497
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
It was clearly fertilizer good for dryer

498
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,240
Obviously

499
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
It's just I know I'm going to be like

500
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
I think I'm telling

501
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Burger for later that's what I think

502
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
The 17th of fire broke out at this fertilizer plant proximately 20 minutes later the whole thing

503
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,208
Blew up an explosion so large that it registered

504
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
2.1 on the Richter

505
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,584
15 people were killed at least 200 were injured.

506
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Consider the amount of likes

507
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Property damage

508
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Surrounding home

509
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Ultatel

510
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,616
What exactly is actually still a matter of intense

511
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
The ATF released the results of their investigation.

512
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
In May 26th

513
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,600
Fire hit

514
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
Some critics have claimed that this

515
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:09,792
Conclusion isn't appropriate since they feel that the ATF only decided that because they couldn't give any other explanation

516
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
For how the fire it started

517
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,144
I'm not entirely sure which side I think has the better

518
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
FairPoint

519
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
You would assume that if the ATF would make the determination that the fire was arson they'd only do that in the case of them have

520
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Excluded other

521
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Possibilities

522
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,688
It seems unlikely that they would do a years-long investigation

523
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Declare something

524
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
Intentional without considering those other possibilities

525
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,344
That's that to this day no specific explanation is known

526
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
And no one has been arrested

527
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
The fire so it's really anyone

528
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
What exactly have

529
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
I mean

530
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
You got to be

531
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Pretty stoked if you get away

532
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
It's blowing up

533
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Fertilizer

534
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,824
Sure I don't know he's guilty

535
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,664
Probably

536
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,040
I guess I don't know

537
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
It's your goal to do it you probably be like

538
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,976
Suspect human involvement was an article in Reuters

539
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
Police records involved

540
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,840
Plant that they looked over from the past 12 years

541
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
Apparently the plant was a very frequent Target for these

542
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Do chemicals

543
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:25,312
Pneumonia

544
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
Right from Reuters quotes

545
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,432
According to a 22002 crime report

546
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
A plant manager

547
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Police that

548
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,576
Intruders were stealing for 25 gallons of anhydrous ammonia every

549
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,880
Free days

550
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
Inconsistent

551
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Good map

552
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,304
And the problem here Jordan is that they ramp-ups

553
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Security in response to these regular break

554
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,424
Reuters found at least 11 reports of burglaries

555
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
Ammonia leak

556
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
At the plant in the prior 12

557
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Okay well I'm going to go with inside

558
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,664
The or just people who come in to try and steal with a valves

559
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
Wingstop

560
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,856
Becoming a robot Dusty old

561
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Chemicals

562
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,976
But none of that's conclusive a pattern of negligence

563
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
The part of the plant

564
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
Secure the facility

565
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Which would leave it open to

566
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Either an RC

567
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Semester summer triangle

568
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
Still shittin just makes a huge

569
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
Mistake that ends up causing misfire

570
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
Yeah it sounds more like

571
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Doing with chemicals

572
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Stu cook

573
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
I'm leaning more towards the guy came in and

574
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
He was like

575
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Oh f*** I f*** that up

576
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:37,248
Recklessness is entirely possible

577
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,856
I'm not sure what happened here other than it was a horrible tragedy for the people of West

578
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
City of

579
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:50,048
Who is absolutely unrelated to the Boston bombing

580
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Facetious

581
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
Catching on fire

582
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
I think he does think that it's related

583
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
Otherwise why would he bring up his alleged drill

584
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
The check place

585
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,800
I can find literally zero evidence

586
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,360
There was a hospital drill there

587
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,408
An article in nurse.com

588
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
Discusses how the medical staff at Hillcrest Baptist

589
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
Just Medical Center and Providence Health Center

590
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
Dealt with the chaotic and traumatic situation

591
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
With a near heroic level of poise

592
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
The two hospitals hundreds of extra page

593
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Patients with a range of injuries

594
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
More less

595
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
They worked effectively as a team

596
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
And Heather Branch the assistant manager the Hillcrest Hospital Emergency

597
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
The department said quote

598
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
It was a life-changing experience

599
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,848
Experience will forever know that no matter what disaster rolls through the doors we will always be there

600
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,968
What are the reasons they were able to operate so effectively as a team and able to treat victims

601
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
I'm so effectively instead of your prior

602
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
They've been part of a drill that recreated an emergency

603
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
Situation like

604
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Which involves hospitals from

605
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
These surroundings five counties

606
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
It involved inter-hospital cooperation

607
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Piece of the response

608
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
The fertilizer plant explosion

609
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,424
Eileen Bohannon the emergency department director at Providence Health Center

610
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Merced quotes

611
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,264
What we learned from previous drills were put into place for this

612
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,056
And I cannot tell you how smoothly it

613
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,224
The only reality to the idea that there were Hospital drills involved in the actual location

614
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,344
Is it a year prior nurses and doctors learned immensely valuable lessons about teamwork

615
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Crisis management

616
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
They were able to put into action

617
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Literally save lives

618
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,744
Do you do drills at

619
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
You're setting up a false

620
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
You don't do drills and

621
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
When you fail miserably

622
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
The globalist

623
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
So much

624
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
God

625
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
That's amazing

626
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,360
That's really cool

627
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
First thing to see the

628
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,224
Like the actual fruits of the drill

629
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,016
To see you like these people were able to

630
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
To do this triage

631
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,112
So effective articles talking about how like

632
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,184
Some of the people that were coming in

633
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
People that they knew

634
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,048
I so people were crying like nurses were breaking down in the middle of it

635
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
And people tagged in

636
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:04,192
You know like you be able to the other room for like 5 minutes and Noah

637
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
Because we understand that this is

638
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
The human part of the response

639
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
Right

640
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
To be done

641
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
We also have to accommodate people who are having

642
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
Difficult time with the job

643
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
You wouldn't be able to do that to affect

644
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
Actively had it not been

645
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Infor

646
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
The consideration of

647
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
Oh yeah I imagine

648
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Somebody you know

649
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Your f******

650
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
You're nowhere near is

651
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Important

652
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
I know you're my friend and

653
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
I'll be very difficult

654
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
I got to save lives

655
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,080
Now later actually more information comes up about

656
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:54,880
The hospitals that were affected actually in the area of this fertilizer fertilizer

657
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
That's

658
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,536
Alex and his people are actually talking about a drill that affected

659
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,424
There was an emergency preparedness drill plan for April 8th

660
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
2013

661
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,008
Is the North Hills Medical

662
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,336
But it was cancelled because of the explosion on the night of the seven

663
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,456
Now this might be interesting if North Hills Medical Center was in Waco or in West

664
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
But it's not

665
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
880 North

666
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
In Northridge

667
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Flint Hills Tech

668
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
This game is so f******

669
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
UCF flimsy this s*** is

670
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
Hey realize that there's nothing

671
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Because nothing you could do to correct this

672
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,632
If you think a drill at a hospital 80 miles away on the wrong day is somehow

673
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
Cause for suspicion whether or not this

674
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
Lotion is real

675
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,776
You're almost certainly past the point of getting back

676
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
Reality

677
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
And that's why I was done

678
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
I'm speaking

679
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,944
You know that this s*** is f****** weak as hell

680
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,576
Northridge

681
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
South blow up Factory

682
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,720
Get back up there and feel like

683
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Easy stuff

684
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
I'm not saying

685
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,400
A planned one before I'm just saying

686
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,288
Alex talk about the picture

687
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
35.

688
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
4chan

689
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Do you like really strength

690
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,016
I think maybe when he got off very kind of realize like

691
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
You know what

692
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
Those are just pictures that we found

693
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,392
Fortune we might

694
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
And make it look

695
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
Some really of

696
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Special ship

697
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
Is the start at the beginning of what happened

698
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,008
Anonymous

699
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Anonymous

700
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,872
Has contacted us as well

National

702
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,408
So it's now some intelligence operatives who are operating as

703
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,712
Anonymous

704
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Data dump

705
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,808
As opposed to Paul Joseph Watson

706
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
With us

707
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Digital dropbox

708
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
It's pretty crazy

709
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,376
So as time has gone on now Alex

710
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,216
That he

711
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
And that the media is in fact

712
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Scared

713
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Of what he's doing on air

714
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
Like people who are aware of what he was doing

715
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Could have

716
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:08,416
But I don't think they're scared

717
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,304
Going for

718
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
Ha

719
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
So Alex's is

720
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Bedtime

721
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
He does something

722
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Media was

723
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,160
MSNBC

724
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
The reporter

725
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
Photos

726
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
Edy's

727
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
Completely blown

728
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
Things are almost going to be like

729
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Okay

730
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
And then

731
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,448
59er probably the only people who can't respond

732
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,776
Everyone else kindergarten

733
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,360
So terrible

734
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,712
Global

735
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
In hindsight this whole thing is

736
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
Through as a trip

737
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,368
Parent display of narcissism

738
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,768
The easiest way to put it is ahead of this story when he's nowhere near anything

739
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,632
The only thing I think is important to point out here is that Alex has once again basajja

740
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Massaging fact

741
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
From the day prior

742
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
In order to make it look like he called every

743
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:35,872
First the announcement that the FBI had photos

744
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
To the erroneous announcement that interested

745
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,832
He makes a little sense for them to announce those two things simultaneously

746
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,904
Blurring of the timeline Alex's using to make it

747
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
It seemed like a mainstream media was

748
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
Leaving Brainerd disarray

749
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
And Chaos than they actually were

750
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Because that's the energy needs

751
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Resent

752
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:00,704
He needs you to think that they had legitimately no idea what to do because Alex is blowing the case wide open

753
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
And the response was

754
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
Completely nonsensical coverage

755
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,384
The second thing is that he never predicted the tienen was going to announce they had photos

756
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,712
He may have said that all fair I guess I can't prove it

757
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Never said that on air

758
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
Alex was completely surprised when cnma there now

759
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
And freaking out himself

760
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,208
I predict they will need to come up with new photos of people

761
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,304
Because our two Blum case wide open

762
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,888
And this I guess could be called in at interpretation

763
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,936
Of the FBI releasing photos of

764
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
We different people than out

765
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,032
Another possibility which I think

766
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
More like

767
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,200
Is that the FBI's zeroed in on the actual culprits

768
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,504
And ultimately they were not talking about the say

769
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
Same photos

770
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
This is where Alex's groundwork becomes so amazingly and

771
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
On the last episode we heard him say at least twice

772
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
Figured out this entire case

773
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
There's a chance that the globalist

774
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
To change the plans

775
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Could happen

776
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,984
That's single caveat is so crucial to his ability to sustain being wrong all the time

777
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
While pretending he's always right

778
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,360
If he's able to construct a reality where he's always right

779
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
And evidence to contradict

780
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,736
Predictions of narrative is just a global is changing their plans

781
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
Because he's too bright

782
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
There's altimate Lee nothing you could do to

783
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Disproven

784
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
He's crafted an inescapable box

785
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
For his audience to live in

786
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
That's a really shity thing for him to do ever

787
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,560
But particularly in response to a large National tragedy like this

788
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
It's monster

789
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,888
His his like a

790
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
Retconning remind

791
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
Give me so much of a

792
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
In the loop

793
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Have you ever seen that movie

794
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,568
Armando iannucci

795
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Pic of it I thought you were talking about that movie that starts

796
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
Kelly was

797
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
American Idol

798
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
They were having

799
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Meeting

800
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
It's like a thinly veiled

801
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
This guy is

802
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Rewrite

803
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
The notes

804
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
He said something

805
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
So chilling with

806
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
It doesn't matter what was

807
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
What matters

808
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
What should happen

809
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
He's rewriting the Holt

810
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
Like that is such

811
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Alex

812
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,808
It doesn't matter what I did say

813
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
Right and that's all that

814
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
Right now it's

815
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
When you try to pass yourself off as like a

816
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:40,960
It's fine if you're just like I'm a guy who

817
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
So in that last week we heard him say that Wolf Blitzer came on photos

818
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,432
A bit

819
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
But after that

820
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Alex

821
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
Clear that the photo and app

822
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Before

823
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
The botched

824
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Erroneous

825
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
Alex's just making all of that up

826
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,272
He's assuming what was going on in place

827
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,112
Jesus knows everything about what was going on with the

828
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,672
People behind the scenes at the end

829
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,488
Repeatedly

830
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,816
He's completely he has nothing to base

831
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:44,192
She is because we all know that Wolf Blitzer can only say Wolf Blitzer he's like

832
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
Pokemon

833
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
Just some people understand.

834
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:53,407
Israeli intelligence

835
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Wolf Blitzer

836
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,575
Does dwelling in a state of lucrative delusion

837
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
If they stretch

838
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
A spy movie on air right now

839
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,215
Taylor Robinson

840
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
I play that also too

841
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
Unprecedented

842
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:33,343
Like a spy movie playing at on-air by Alex's right

843
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,231
Misleading and really abusive

844
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,071
Bluetooth audio

845
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
Being played out on air

846
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,007
Talking about the anonymous

847
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Data dump

848
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Seems to think

849
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
There

850
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Good guys

851
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
In like a CIA

852
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:06,111
Are the FBI's Shoreway Community good guy

853
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:29,407
It will show you the originator

854
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Was Oliver

855
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,119
Avocado

856
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
Good job Drudge

857
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:59,615
Thanks drudge intelligent

858
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,687
Broadcast

859
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,015
I think it's so funny to me

860
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,087
Him announcing that they did a Google

861
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Image search was

862
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,695
That is the most research they have ever

863
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,583
Admitted actually have honestly don't even believe that it's true

864
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,215
I think Alex just knows the Google image search

865
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
Right

866
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
Alex

867
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,991
Is now kind of because their questioning of Janet Napolitano involved questions about this.

868
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Arabian

869
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
National that was supposedly

870
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,367
Going to be deported who's been conflated with

871
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,927
The guy who

872
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,047
Has now become much more popular

873
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
In conspiracy world

874
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,887
And so now Alex is starting to build a case

875
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,679
Probably going to get paid

876
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
And on Saturday

877
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
Completely

878
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,919
Emergency

879
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Sing for them

880
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
To do

881
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
Little people on the internet

882
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,615
Out of context images that they've created

883
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
Does not really have an impact on an investigation

884
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
That's real

885
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
Yeah

886
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
I think it has

887
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Level up

888
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,351
Asher

889
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
It's as relevant

890
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,527
So if Alex

891
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,551
Search

892
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
Yesterday

893
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
On the 17th

894
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
They were all set

895
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
To blame

896
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
White gun owners

897
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,327
Unbelievable

898
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,751
Beavis and Butthead

899
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
So Alex is just

900
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:52,415
Going to blame that guy

901
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,231
And now they're having to shift who they're going to pin it on

902
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
Do you think that's going to be

903
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
Probably because he

904
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
You saw the

905
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,631
Cover of the New York Post

906
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,215
Assume that the same as the dispi photos

907
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
It's very simple.

908
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,543
Is very bad

909
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,615
Yeah but what are the elements that he's using

910
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,407
Is mixed up in his narrative

911
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
Is that on the 70

912
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
They had a bump

913
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,295
Called into the courthouse

914
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,367
Ended up making them cancel the Press

915
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
They were going to hold back

916
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,719
Determined that he knows why

917
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,735
Unbelievable

918
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,783
I think it's impossible

919
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:57,439
The first thing he has literally no reason to think that this white guy in the photos

920
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,255
The blame

921
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,607
He is literally zero reason to think that the police ever even talk to that guy

922
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:10,751
Anyway important to the story is internet rumor and Alex's fantasies

923
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,335
This is the definition of terrible work on Alex's party

924
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,663
I don't know who this white guy these pictures

925
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,479
I don't particularly want

926
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,831
Everything I can find leads me to believe that he

927
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
He's just a private sitter

928
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,439
Listen who is at the marathon who became a central focus on the internet

929
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:33,535
Largely motivated by Alex Jones's death Britney Spears

930
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,839
Little white person was going to be blamed for the bombing

931
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,983
And tell anyone can prove that he is anything other than a marathon attendee you happen to have a backpack

932
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,519
I believe he deserves his privacy

933
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,335
And I wouldn't even to prove Alex Jones

934
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Throng

935
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
But there's a more important aspect

936
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,247
And that is the weather at wherever this guy

937
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
In the days after the bombing

938
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
He was very likely not aware or maybe he was aware the pictures of him were being spread all over the in

939
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
Internet implying he was involved in

940
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,511
Plan to murder in Maine his fellow City

941
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
All evidence seems to indicate that he was a victim of this

942
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,631
This attack

943
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:15,263
They are not necessarily sure that he got injured or whatever you might have been I don't know

944
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,103
But anyone who's there I consider a victim of

945
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,407
And instead of plastic processes

946
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,199
Experience and move on with his life

947
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:27,039
He's helping playing for the very thing he just unfortunately had to leave

948
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,343
And I don't know what his experience

949
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
That was like

950
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,671
But from the account of that Saudi Arabians

951
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,975
We discussed earlier you have to assume that it wasn't

952
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Positive

953
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:41,631
Going from experiencing the terror of a terrorist attack to immediately have an unfounded suspicion

954
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Thrown your way

955
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,959
Give me different things a difficult thing for anyone

956
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
To go through

957
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
As I mentioned in the intro

958
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,175
On April 18th New York Post cover story with an image of two other people that were gathering internet

959
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Suspicion with a text

960
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Quote bagman

961
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
These two pictured at the Boston Marathon

962
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,367
The problem was this

963
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,951
And the one they ran wasn't the one

964
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
That the FBI was such a release

965
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,791
Or anything that the DHS

966
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
First to report they committed an egregious Act

967
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,959
This picture that they had published

968
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Had been circulated by law

969
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
But it wasn't in the context.

970
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Two were

971
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:27,711
Also other emails that were later produced clearly said that these men were quote not Aventura

972
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,783
And that they're being singled out was based on quote

973
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Bogus Intel

974
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,111
In October 2014

975
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:39,487
New York Post would settle a defamation lawsuit for the for this cover for an undisclosed amount

976
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,279
But something

977
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,607
So important to not lose sight of his how damaging these actions are

978
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
To the people who were the

979
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,751
The Washington Post reported on one of the men featured on the New York Post cover

980
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
Who is only 70

981
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
18 years old

982
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,383
His father said quote his now only

983
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,687
Sleep 1 or 2 hours a night

984
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
And sometimes refuses to go to school

985
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,271
This kind of stuck-up

986
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
This deeply traumatic

987
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,855
To the people who end up having internet mob

988
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,879
Track them down

989
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,463
Or they can't go to school without everyone thinking they were part of a plot to kill

990
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
Civilian

991
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,279
As we criticize Alex

992
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
Discovered just important

993
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,119
New York Post

994
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,423
Because if we didn't it would be slightly dishonest

995
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
Stupid f****** Oblivion

996
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,103
Not to disclose to Mi I don't know how much

997
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
The important

998
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
Things it's the other side

999
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,735
Like as we criticize the media like them for their horrible errors

1000
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,063
New York Post apologized

1001
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,415
Alex Jones isn't held to the same standard

1002
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,999
He relishes acting in this destructive way

1003
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
For me that's a very relevant difference

1004
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,911
As for the courthouse that was only evacuated briefly because of a bomb threat

1005
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
It turned out to not be real

1006
00:51:53,983 --> 00:52:00,127
Evacuation

1007
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,687
Back to work the only thing that's based on his own thoughts

1008
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,735
There's literally nothing else supporting this

1009
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
He can't prove even a basic piece

1010
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
Service.

1011
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
It's just embarrassing

1012
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,183
It's made even worse by the fact that the same time they evacuated at Courthouse

1013
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:18,815
The police also evacuated one of the plazas in from the entrance to bring them and Women's Hospital in Boston

1014
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,863
Bring up

1015
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,655
Alex has his explanation

1016
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,727
The space of literally nothing except are paranoid delusions

1017
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,007
Whereas the realities

1018
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Seems a lot like

1019
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
City that just offered a bombing

1020
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,919
And they're taking any bomb threats pretty seriously whether or not their death

1021
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:34,943
Incredible

1022
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
And that interferes with government business

1023
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
It interferes with the

1024
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
A police business

1025
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
First Tech

1026
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
You know you wake up

1027
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Like the internet thing

1028
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
That's just like

1029
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
It makes you almost

1030
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
Everybody to have a

1031
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
Kill switch for all of their social media

1032
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
Profiles

1033
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Scrubs

1034
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
Clean at a f******

1035
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,871
Bug out bag

1036
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,431
Yeah that's fine

1037
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
Nova Scotia and stay there for a year

1038
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Dad's terrify

1039
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
You can't

1040
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,367
You can't doubt needs a liger

1041
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,487
Just got to let it blow over and hope no one

1042
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,791
Eudoxus

1043
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
You got to lay low for

1044
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
A while

1045
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,119
That's awful

1046
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,471
Text Cliff Alex pretends that he had predicted that it would be the Saudis

1047
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,495
I already

1048
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
I don't believe is true based

1049
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
By listening

1050
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Episode

1051
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
I'll let him have his

1052
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
After-the-fact predict

1053
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,295
Remember

1054
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
Alex is very needy

1055
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
On this episode of you had notice

1056
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,783
He wants a pat on the head for doing this great reporting

1057
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
Does a good job for the first

1058
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
You really want

1059
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,879
People that have to like

1060
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Sit down and be like

1061
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,463
Find this one time

1062
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Great

1063
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,815
Will give you this one

1064
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:33,215
Yeah she just wasn't God you have been right all along I like

1065
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,287
You validated years of b*******

1066
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
Breaks the case

1067
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,383
Initially I had no idea

1068
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,407
About this idea

1069
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,431
DHHS release

1070
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,991
Same photos that you was rambling about

1071
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,295
So what did you and I can't find any indication that

1072
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,599
The DHS and released any photos of the

1073
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
Backed up to this point

1074
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:55,743
The farthest a gone was that Janet Napolitano testified that they did have

1075
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,839
From further digging I know that Alex is just talkin about the New York Post

1076
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
I consulted the Infowars website

1077
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,679
Found it on April 8th

1078
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,751
Paul Joseph Watson posted an article titled breaking

1079
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,079
Police confirm Infowars photos of Boston stuff

1080
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:17,247
Which is all just about the New York Post cover their making this faulty assumption that that is the confirm police photo

1081
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,319
It's very unlike Infowars to make correct

1082
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
Because the New York Post

1083
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,927
Tickets for this

1084
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,743
This article includes

1085
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Editor's note

1086
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,631
The above photo was originally given to the New York Post by the FBI as Persons of Interest

1087
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Add a light

1088
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,959
They were no longer Persons of Interest

1089
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,751
That of course means that the

1090
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,799
Police did not confirm Infowars photos

1091
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,591
In his article is total b*******

1092
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,151
However it does clarify for me

1093
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,759
The DHHS had the same pictures as

1094
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:57,183
What important Point here though is that the picture on the cover of the New York Post is absolutely not the same ones that Alex has been obsessing

1095
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:06,143
Broken and the guy

1096
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,983
Where's the post cover had these two Maraca gentlemen want of home

1097
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Doesn't even have a backpack

1098
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,359
The FBI would go on to release the images

1099
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,895
The suspects taken from surveillance

1100
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
What's cameras on April 8th

1101
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
In the afternoon

1102
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,063
It hasn't happened by the time Alex

1103
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,879
Iran are talking about photos being released

1104
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,975
This is all probably another negative results of the New York Post cover

1105
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,047
Alex has decided it's an official DHHS release

1106
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:37,119
And now he's worked it into his narratives further reinforcing

1107
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
The idea that he's right about

1108
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
It's real simple

1109
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,239
But but

1110
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:47,871
It's one of those things like the path is really windy but it's not hard to walk if you just

1111
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
Beautiful look at

1112
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,455
It's not much of a maze

1113
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
You don't have to

1114
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
Is not there but you

1115
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,135
You should take the article.

1116
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,511
Confirm editor's note

1117
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,303
Right

1118
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,351
It's super rare on Infowars

1119
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,679
Straight up

1120
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
104

1121
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
They just left

1122
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
No editor's notes nothing

1123
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,079
Supercuts

1124
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,407
Yeah let's make sure we're not even

1125
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,455
Close

1126
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
So at this point Alex

1127
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,831
Repeats a little bit of Internet rumor

1128
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
About this

1129
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,207
Conspiracy spaghetti against the wall thing

1130
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Asher

1131
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,871
666 Boylston Street

1132
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,527
Calling card

1133
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:06,207
The marathon ended 666

1134
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,791
Jared kushner's property on 5th Avenue

1135
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,839
Don't look into that Alex

1136
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:16,959
If you look up this bit of non trivia about the marathon ending its 666 Boylston

1137
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:21,823
You'll find a bunch of very reputable source is picking up the story after the 18th

1138
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,383
Probably response to a simplify

1139
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,199
We're talking about UFO blogger.com

1140
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,759
We're talkin about USA Hitman.com

1141
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,855
We're talkin about Galactic connection.com Heavy Hitters

1142
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,671
Hard-hitting New Trier and the New York Post

1143
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,975
Wouldn't put it past

1144
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:43,071
However if you reported earlier

1145
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
April 8th

1146
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
There's only one Outlet

1147
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,447
Enough it clearly has to be where Alex is taking this

1148
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,287
It's a little bulshit website called beforeitsnews.com

1149
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,359
Beforeitsnews was started in 2000

1150
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,151
Possibly with good intentions

1151
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:01,759
At the place where any citizen journalists out there could post news items they thought needed more coverage

1152
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
Naturally this quickly became a favorite place

1153
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,647
Completely insane people to masquerade their nonsense

1154
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
Anybody who takes

1155
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,743
This place as a credible place to find information

1156
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
The complete

1157
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,047
Or delusional

1158
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:19,423
Just for fun I decided to look back and see what beforeitsnews is running as some of their front page stories

1159
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Does taking the six

1160
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,031
S*** from them I'm telling you somebody was a lizard

1161
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:28,127
Unfortunately there's no snapshot in the way-back machine from The A-Team

1162
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,663
But there is one

1163
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
And here's some of their headlights

1164
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:35,295
Travelers are among us!

1165
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,135
Nibiru hard evidence

1166
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
I don't think that evidence is that

1167
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:46,559
Napoleon skull!

1168
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,375
I like the! That one might even required

1169
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,703
This one's a little tougher

1170
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,007
The most profound mystery in the world

1171
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,567
I don't know that's going to be bad

1172
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,039
Is the most ambiguous about

1173
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:11,391
Whether or not you can see it.

1174
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,927
It's bad

1175
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
The riddle

1176
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,351
Very very

1177
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:25,983
Boston bombing is a false flag and a lot of links to Alex's coverage

1178
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,775
This is part of a tea cozy

1179
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
Beforeitsnews

1180
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
Finishing Line of the marathon was it 6

1181
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,711
6 Boylston

1182
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,527
And that is the fact that by definition the finish line

1183
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,063
Tire Street

1184
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,159
If one side where it's 66

1185
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
6

1186
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
67

1187
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,743
Present

1188
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,095
List all traces back to a purported Google Earth image

1189
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,655
But I'm 90% sure is Photoshop

1190
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,959
You're the reason I think that okay

1191
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:01,823
The image shows a marker at 7666 Boylston

1192
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,919
In the center lane of traffic it's indicating that the center of traffic

1193
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
An address

1194
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,503
The street itself does not have an address

1195
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
The buildings do

1196
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,367
Meet at the street would be showing up as having a physical

1197
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
School Street address

1198
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
The second issue I have

1199
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,463
Is if you look at Google Maps

1200
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,511
Can you consult the street view

1201
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,815
You can easily find the finish line of the marathon

1202
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,375
Regardless of whether or not it's Marathon

1203
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,679
Isn't that line is always painted on the street

1204
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,727
If you look at the side of the street that

1205
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
Evenly number

1206
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:36,127
You'll find the Marathon finish line is pretty closely matched up with the Boston Public Library

1207
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,151
Whose addresses

1208
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
100

1209
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,551
The building immediately next to it appears to possibly be a different building

1210
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:47,135
But it's actually just an extension to Boston Library known as the McKim bill

1211
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,439
It's easily identifiable B

1212
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,743
Inscription on the on the side of the building

1213
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:56,607
The Commonwealth requires the education of the people is the Safeguard of order and Liberty

1214
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
Ironic

1215
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,423
And Subway is based on

1216
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
So dumb

1217
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,055
The McKim building is a home a lot alike research collections

1218
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,847
God damn gorgeous piece of

1219
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,127
Particularly inside

1220
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
Look so cool

1221
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
Buildings physical addresses

1222
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,015
As the main entrance is on the in

1223
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Intersecting Street Dartmouth

1224
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,343
There is no 666 Boylston

1225
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,463
These conspiracy theorists

1226
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,839
Real address and it being something

1227
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
Okay then he's in the middle of the

1228
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Because what

1229
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
Directly underneath

1230
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Boylston Street

1231
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,543
Dude hell

1232
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,079
Physical address

1233
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:44,479
Everyone knows that he'll is actually underneath the WWE ring my life

1234
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Fever

1235
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:58,559
Other Supernatural characters will pop up and drag someone down under the ring

1236
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,615
So this is nothing more than bulshit promoted by a completely crackpot website

1237
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
But stupid number

1238
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:20,575
And you'd only be doing s*** like this if you wanted to create unnecessary suspicion about

1239
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
People using

1240
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
Ninja Turtles addresses

1241
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,303
224 + 8 what is that

1242
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
Pizza delivery

1243
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,911
Alex's

1244
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Is expression

1245
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
F****** pissed off

1246
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
Coffee is that no one giving him

1247
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,567
Credit for breaking these pictures

1248
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
Of the DHHS

1249
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,687
Announcing their pictures which are obviously

1250
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:53,855
And now I

1251
01:03:54,111 --> 01:04:00,255
Congressional hearing

1252
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,263
Are Fox News

1253
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:18,175
Because

1254
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,463
And they show you some photos

1255
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:39,167
100

1256
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
Sad

1257
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,919
But it makes sense

1258
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,479
How he could trick people into thinking this

1259
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
In the moment

1260
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,783
Like its

1261
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
Day

1262
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,647
When the FBI has actually released the pictures

1263
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,439
This looks really

1264
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
God stupid

1265
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
This looks like a child

1266
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:10,655
Thinking he's right about something that everyone saying

1267
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,727
People would write hit pieces about irresponsible

1268
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
Wrong

1269
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
You because you were wrong about the

1270
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,079
Right you were

1271
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,639
Putting undue focus on private citizen

1272
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Deeply

1273
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:28,575
Yeah we'll give you credit for f****** the s*** up but you are not right about

1274
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
Bright

1275
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,647
So you get that pat on the head

1276
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,791
Is it now

1277
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,327
Alex

1278
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,863
Has been reporting on for a day

1279
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,167
They're also now apparently

1280
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
Congressional

1281
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
Looks like

1282
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,551
You think I'm running

1283
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:06,719
Courthouse

1284
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
Photos of

1285
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,375
Today

1286
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,447
Congressional hearings

1287
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
Congressional hearings

1288
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,543
The genitive politano speaking

1289
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,847
With the homeland security committee

1290
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
In the house

1291
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,919
But these pictures weren't

1292
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
She just

1293
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,991
Disgusting

1294
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Fixers

1295
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
That they had

1296
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
So

1297
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,343
This is just Alex

1298
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,879
Yelling about nothing

1299
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Is b*******

1300
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,463
But

1301
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,999
On our last episode

1302
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
Outside Steve pieczenik on

1303
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
To commit treason

1304
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Yeah

1305
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:54,079
But also to give the motive for the false flag

1306
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,383
The next day that Alex is just parroting that

1307
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,919
The exact same motor

1308
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
Also

1309
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
By Bush

1310
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,359
Again this wasn't a bipartisan

1311
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:32,223
Congressional report on governmental organization

1312
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,807
Call Dee Congressional Constitution project

1313
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,647
Is funded the specific report was funded by grants for the Rockefellers

1314
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,207
And the open Society Soros Foundation

1315
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,535
Does all the lot of bulshit but Alex's using it easy using it as like

1316
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,863
They needed to get that out of the headlines that's why they did this false flag

1317
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
You see all the

1318
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Who's coming into place

1319
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,495
You get the answers for the why the house

1320
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,079
If you need to do it cuz he's running out of time

1321
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,359
Yeah it doesn't matter

1322
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Ingredients

1323
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,199
And you know

1324
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
It's so easy to

1325
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,135
If you just look at it

1326
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
But it also

1327
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
Like I can I can

1328
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
Project back

1329
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,743
To that time

1330
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,279
When there's not a lot of info

1331
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,303
Formation available

1332
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,095
It's such an easy

1333
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
Anything to manipulate

1334
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,423
Dangerous

1335
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Space

1336
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,519
To have large groups of people in

1337
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
High anxiety

1338
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
Even if

1339
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,503
You would normally otherwise be able to

1340
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
Directly

1341
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,295
Through that's for the

1342
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Apparent bulshit

1343
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
In a

1344
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
Emotional overwritten

1345
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
It's just going to be

1346
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
Can really

1347
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
Do that your

1348
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,631
You know you got the

1349
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,399
On over your eyes

1350
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,823
Comes back to the same thing where it's I caught recruitment is a lot easier with people who are invulnerable

1351
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,895
Like you just have a breakup

1352
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
Something like that

1353
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
You kicked out of your house

1354
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
Much easier for nefarious apps

1355
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,295
To come in and

1356
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
I think it was like I could

1357
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
See how it'd be so easy

1358
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,695
The Bewilderbeast

1359
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
List of Alex's

1360
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
Conspiracy bulshit

1361
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:26,399
Like all of this is not based on looking at pictures

1362
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,959
This is the perfect

1363
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
Time

1364
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,775
For something like this to happen the ingredients

1365
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
So right

1366
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Right for him

1367
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
And it's

1368
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,431
I think that's a lot of the part of why I looking at this may

1369
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
Makes me really Act

1370
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,271
Is because I you can see the variables there

1371
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
You can speak

1372
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831
Alex behaving in such

1373
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
Which way is heat

1374
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
He's aware of that

1375
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
Like this

1376
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
But he knows

1377
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,999
This is when

1378
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
The Tide is coming in

1379
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
And I have to

1380
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
Yeah I mean

1381
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,399
Bournout

1382
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:02,495
Throughout his entire career after every tragedy is his moment

1383
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,543
Strike

1384
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,871
Another level

1385
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
Absolutely

1386
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,431
It feels

1387
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,503
Pretty sure yeah in a way that other

1388
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
The other ones that we looked at

1389
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,927
The government in the media and the globalist

1390
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
During crisis

1391
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
Right now

1392
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
Because Alex is bust

1393
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,279
Their whole game

1394
01:10:55,231 --> 01:11:01,375
Would you say it if you lose the Mandate of Heaven

1395
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:08,543
Touching what would you say that the leaders lose the ice plant

1396
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,615
Funny that Alex now.

1397
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,663
Chinese

1398
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,247
Robertson

1399
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,039
Very consistent

1400
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
Green thumbs

1401
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,159
Perhaps

1402
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,559
Exploit

1403
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
Adt's has that he's got a message

1404
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
Cuz he knows they're listening

1405
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
It's kind of fun

1406
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
But also I should tell you

1407
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:39,775
You never give

1408
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,871
Later

1409
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
I have a message

1410
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:04,095
He doesn't get to my message but you could argue that this entire thing is

1411
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,191
University

1412
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
Here's what I want to say to you

1413
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,263
This Sunday

1414
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
My first thought was

1415
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
I'm a monster who should

1416
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
Destroyed and my next thought was

1417
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,711
Here's what I need to say to the club

1418
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,247
I could talk s*** on Middlebrook

1419
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,039
Alex believe

1420
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,367
Let's start spinning into a little bit of religious stuff

1421
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
Throughout this episode

1422
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:31,231
And one of the things he discusses is the fact that he has

1423
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,023
And he is literally on

1424
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Killable

1425
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,527
That's pretty wild

1426
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,551
I mean

1427
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,343
Based upon

1428
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,415
Mission of the Bible that is true regardless of whether or not he

1429
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
Kind of heavenly

1430
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Protection

1431
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,279
Yeah I know I mean like every boys

1432
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,815
Everybody's date and time is

1433
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,887
Predetermined by God

1434
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,655
Like what do you say

1435
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,447
I feel like there's more behind it

1436
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:16,031
Bulletproof

1437
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,359
Because he's here on a mission

1438
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
From God

1439
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:24,991
Totally fine with the idea that people have liked vague Notions about

1440
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,551
Guardian angels and stuff like

1441
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,319
Calls

1442
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,207
Everyone believe protection I don't

1443
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,231
Carol it's your prerogative

1444
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
However

1445
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,327
I think it's a way that Alex's framing this is super f***** up

1446
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
41

1447
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,143
He's making it a thing where God has to be

1448
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
Decide in order for him to even be

1449
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
Killable

1450
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,495
Anything

1451
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,287
Possibly due to have woodwork

1452
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
Some gardening Angels our protector

1453
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,127
That's all good and well

1454
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,455
But if you really believe that obsessed with guns

1455
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,039
Why would he constantly talk about how many guns you keeps in the studio

1456
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,855
Shouldn't be comfortable in the fact that even if someone broke into

1457
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:06,207
Infowars HQ with a gun they wouldn't be able to do anything cuz he has God's protection

1458
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:11,327
Graton Casino

1459
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,631
Who are allegedly ex Blackwater employees

1460
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:18,239
Why would Alex need Mercenaries 2 protective of any attack against it wouldn't work

1461
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,543
The only way to make this make sense

1462
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
Is it Alex knows that

1463
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
He doesn't have

1464
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:28,991
Have God's protection

1465
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
God heaven

1466
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,319
Made me an indestructible Warrior

1467
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
Deep down

1468
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,671
He knows that he's manipulating people in his a force for bad in the world

1469
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
Dial this Jordan

1470
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,863
Under The Heading of more possible evidence that Alex did join up with those Satanist Antoinette dial

1471
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
I think that might be the case

1472
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,983
God helps those who shoot

1473
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
People that's how

1474
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
Esposo

1475
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,103
Really like you only way to make that make sense

1476
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:00,479
Is it like he wouldn't have Seth with the arming himself to the teeth

1477
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:04,319
Yeah if he felt that he had Divine protection he would be all about

1478
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,647
Send

1479
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,927
Walking through life

1480
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,951
Untouchable

1481
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Like

1482
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
Yeah

1483
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,167
The professed leader of his

1484
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,215
Things of God was like

1485
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,519
And it's house

1486
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,567
I would assume that he does

1487
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
The talking about.

1488
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,687
Who as we heard on the last episode

1489
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,503
The one before that

1490
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,039
Has gone to Boston

1491
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,111
He is an official Infowars employee

1492
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,647
He's there with an Infowars bike

1493
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,951
He's yelling infowars.com but everybody

1494
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Disruptive

1495
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,023
These press conferences

1496
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,071
That the mayor of Boston

1497
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,863
And the authorities

1498
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
To give

1499
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
2

1500
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Call the public

1501
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,239
Whatever information out

1502
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,519
Is is known

1503
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,799
Determined baby

1504
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Investigations

1505
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,103
So Alex

1506
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,151
This clip

1507
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
Up till this point

1508
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
Work

1509
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
At press conference

1510
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,063
But it takes him forever to

1511
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
Stop talking about the footage

1512
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:17,535
And this is just a camera

1513
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,095
IPad

1514
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,311
Doesn't recognize

1515
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,671
The drill

1516
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,951
Harry doesn't he literally just says no neck

1517
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,719
Next question

1518
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,999
He doesn't get mad

1519
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
Describing

1520
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:35,103
If you go and watch them you'll see if anything and exceeding level of patience

1521
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
Display towards Tampa.

1522
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:40,479
They don't kick him out even though he's clearly being disruptive and making accusations

1523
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,015
Supposed to ask a question

1524
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,087
Governor Patrick does

1525
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:50,463
Steve enraged answer your question

1526
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
Slight annoying

1527
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,535
This is really important to Alex

1528
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,303
His narrative.

1529
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,351
No matter what response Tampa.

1530
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:00,191
Officials being caught with their hand in the cookie jar

1531
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
It's really a very basic propaganda

1532
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:08,895
You go and send some annoying a******* to go yell at a press conference in a pretty high likelihood

1533
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,223
If it gets thrown out you can argue that they can't handle the truth

1534
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,527
If I the officials yell at him

1535
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:21,951
I think I'll just kind of betting on something like that happening and I'll put down D managed to provoke is the governor

1536
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
One word answer to his question

1537
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,351
Because there's nothing here Alex has to go really overboard characterizing the video

1538
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,631
That's honestly really but

1539
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,191
Another important Point here

1540
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,495
Is it the video that Alex does end up showing

1541
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,079
Is edited to make it look like a press conference ends in response

1542
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,103
Stupid Andy's question

1543
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:42,431
Officials responded to other

1544
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
People's questions

1545
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,271
This too is a crucial piece of Alex's narrative

1546
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,063
He needs to make it appear that there's

1547
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,343
So afraid of this Quest

1548
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
False Flags in

1549
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,439
Drill run away from plan press conference

1550
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,463
Reinforce

1551
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,279
Reinforce this narrative

1552
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,607
He's putting out he's so dangerous

1553
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,375
Real

1554
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,167
All this is smoking mirrors

1555
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:03,935
And edit

1556
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,471
Because I know damn well

1557
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:11,871
Play the raw footage of the press conference will just look like a loser who the adults

1558
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,407
That doesn't work well for the

1559
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,711
You forced the narrative

1560
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,503
They're scared

1561
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,551
That would be good test

1562
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
There

1563
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
Alex's

1564
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,719
Could you play the full

1565
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
Unedited video

1566
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Coach people

1567
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:29,791
So well but

1568
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,559
Beforehand

1569
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,583
That when they watch it

1570
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
Did they do see

1571
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:39,263
What's the nearest place that sells

1572
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,615
The video

1573
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
Like

1574
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,687
It's almost like

1575
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
I'm surprised that they even

1576
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,991
Bother to edit

1577
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,295
Well it makes it now makes

1578
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,087
Easier as a point event

1579
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,623
Cuz right now you can't

1580
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:59,487
Show the established nearly

1581
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,279
We're not going for just

1582
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,559
The diehards

1583
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:08,703
New eyes

1584
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,471
To get people to

1585
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:13,311
To do Google bombs where they like everybody search for false Flags

1586
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
Analytics

1587
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,152
Higher on Alex's

1588
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Articles

1589
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,480
Are TAG false flag in the middle

1590
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,808
You know that's going to drive more traffic

1591
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
To him

1592
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
You trying to do this

1593
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,672
Yeah yeah yeah

1594
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,952
The full

1595
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:35,072
Press conference would work with people who have already internalized the narrative

1596
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,632
But you need the edited version in order

1597
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
To get them to

1598
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,192
To the point where they would internalize

1599
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
It helps

1600
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,008
It's one of the only things

1601
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,824
It's like intersecting with the real world

1602
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,616
Of this investigation

1603
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,432
Is we have damprid Auntie yelling at people to Prescott

1604
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,736
It's such a crucial piece

1605
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
Of the propaganda

1606
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,552
Alex is putting on

1607
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
Do you need to edit

1608
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,368
I do agree

1609
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
Eventually you could just show the whole

1610
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,976
Yeah it wouldn't it wouldn't matter

1611
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,840
Another really interesting difference

1612
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,632
Between then and now we're

1613
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,704
The president can admit to committing crimes

1614
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,472
The people be like

1615
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,312
Crimes people

1616
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
To believe whatever it is

1617
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
In the present

1618
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,200
He's not really bothering with

1619
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
To attract

1620
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:30,368
The new listeners as much as possible but he's not bothering with trying to

1621
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,208
He's like here's what you get

1622
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,488
We don't often

1623
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
And uplifting

1624
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,792
Sing to his clipso you play the

1625
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,072
The trumpet but they're often

1626
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,864
Do you have the parts that are ghosts

1627
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,192
Interesting to other folk art

1628
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,496
Incredibly stupid

1629
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
Isn't included

1630
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:51,104
Presentation

1631
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,384
To fit his narrative

1632
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,152
For sure

1633
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,944
Right

1634
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,272
I think you're pointed also stand that he's probably left

1635
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,040
Interested

1636
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:04,928
In the wide net

1637
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:09,536
That boats

1638
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,328
I can probably appeal to

1639
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,216
Show the photos

1640
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
That he broke a date

1641
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,520
Before

1642
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
Electric current

1643
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Beam through this a

1644
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,616
Just mad at the media

1645
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,408
Covering it up

1646
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
The control

1647
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,224
The controlled media

1648
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
Won't show the pictures that I broke

1649
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,624
The government isn't showing

1650
01:22:56,384 --> 01:23:02,528
And the

1651
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:46,304
So it's important that I imagine papers are thrown

1652
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,864
About what's going on

1653
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,984
This is what's going

1654
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
It's so stupid

1655
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,056
It is it is

1656
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,104
Like a

1657
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
Now it's

1658
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,176
I'm so used to it

1659
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
Still

1660
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
Ratably annoying

1661
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
Wendy's

1662
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
Supposed powerful

1663
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
Why

1664
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,856
And whimpers

1665
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,440
Is all the

1666
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
Why is

1667
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:20,096
Minion picture that's the flipside of Alex's North

1668
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,680
Soft underbelly

1669
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
Whining all the

1670
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,824
The time

1671
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
But the bombing

1672
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,600
A lot of it is very intense

1673
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
Like

1674
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,184
Figuring out where he's getting these ideas

1675
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,792
And this is one of them

1676
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,352
Alex

1677
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,656
Infowars article

1678
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,704
And he realizes in the middle of it

1679
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,496
Started reading this comment

1680
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,288
This is great

1681
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,872
Wards.com

1682
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,296
Real quick just point out

1683
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,856
It's really important

1684
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,880
He said he loves me

1685
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,184
He doesn't take it to actual

1686
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,584
Sorella

1687
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,888
Something is he set this up by saying I love this

1688
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:38,176
Original Boston

1689
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
Caliber

1690
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:04,800
It was super pissed off about

1691
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,896
When the company that moderated comments dropped him

1692
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
Infowars

1693
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,224
Like all the article

1694
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,576
Yeah but there's just no comment

1695
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,416
I can even pull it up in the way-back machine but comments don't populate any

1696
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:25,280
I really wanted to track down this, cuz I wanted to know if am use the n-word

1697
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,328
I'd say that's my only question

1698
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:32,704
Alex realize that he started reading it explicitly

1699
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,312
I love this, he realizes I'm in trouble

1700
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,408
There's nothing funnier than Alex saying olympic-caliber

1701
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,712
And it goes on it goes on

1702
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:48,064
It's so stupid

1703
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
On the screen

1704
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,672
Are they may have

1705
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:58,048
It's like

1706
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:58,816
It goes on

1707
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:03,424
He tried that trick when he was reading that article about his fan who kidnapped his children

1708
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,752
We wouldn't have to read the part about the guy tying up the kids grandmother

1709
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
Internet comment

1710
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,664
By saying he loved it

1711
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,968
The only question I have is how racist

1712
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
It was

1713
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,808
If it's through Alex for a loop that makes me think it had to be really race

1714
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,600
Edward level

1715
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,160
Oh yeah either way I was realizing

1716
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,976
Cynthia

1717
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,792
Tried to mask the comments racism

1718
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
But he made the mistake

1719
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,864
Of keeping on reading

1720
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,632
And here's what

1721
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:41,824
Sociopath

1722
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,128
Obama

1723
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,328
So stupid

1724
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,120
I love this comment I had read it

1725
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:09,216
Love this, and we're home. Edward ever f******

1726
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
Coward

1727
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,008
Started

1728
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:20,736
He hasn't and finds out a rapist

1729
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:28,672
It's titled the riddle of the Jews

1730
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:34,304
30 white horses on a Red Hill I think

1731
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,120
Is it the fact that he's taking time to do s*** like that

1732
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,144
Should indicate

1733
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,168
That this next

1734
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
Cliff

1735
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:05,792
Information

1736
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,296
From the bombers

1737
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:36,512
So the important thing here is it so important for him to paint

1738
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,304
This Anonymous person

1739
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,656
4chan being his source

1740
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,680
Because

1741
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,448
It sucks

1742
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
In in the narrative

1743
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,568
And he needs to patch up that hole

1744
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:52,896
It needs to come from some very legitimate credible source

1745
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:58,272
Which is these Anonymous good people within the intelligence Community who are sick of the bulshit

1746
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
Otherwise

1747
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:02,368
Closer analysis

1748
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,160
Message Board what you doing

1749
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,720
Understand how it is

1750
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,256
Supposed to

1751
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,304
How it is we're supposed to reconcile

1752
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,584
Two things in the same

1753
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
And which is first

1754
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,448
We Google searched it and it's been on a bunch of Twitter

1755
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,472
House already

1756
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,008
+ 2

1757
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,568
It was given to us directly by

1758
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
These intelligences

1759
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,408
Google Twitter accounts

1760
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,456
After the fact

1761
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:33,088
It's people had gathered all of those photos from to Alex

1762
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,744
In reality Paul Joseph Watson with cruising fortune and now they've created

1763
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,512
Nextdoor

1764
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,584
For a better source for the information

1765
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,608
It's

1766
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,448
Annoyed not professional work

1767
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:53,824
But reality

1768
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,408
Fire. Alex knows how to

1769
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,736
But he does know what's real which is good

1770
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:05,344
Next clip under the headline of Alex

1771
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,136
Just constantly complaining that

1772
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
No one is

1773
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,952
Back again throwing a parade

1774
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,232
For his awesome report

1775
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,608
It's so controlling

1776
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,912
Drudgereport.com

1777
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,472
The photos

1778
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,280
He's just so bent out of shape but no one is

1779
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,864
Congratulating a bad work

1780
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:53,728
The first time you really believe

1781
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,568
He did good work I think you're right that's why you responded yet

1782
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,616
That he's like for real guys look

1783
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:06,784
You know I know we both know what's been going on I mean wants a parade but

1784
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,624
So focused on no one giving

1785
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,208
Credit it does have a different feel to it then

1786
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
Is wild

1787
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,560
Hyperventilating on air

1788
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:23,168
In order to sort of real serious times

1789
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,240
And in the process ends up making

1790
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
Ludacris

1791
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
Of course

1792
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:34,432
I'm having some butterflies

1793
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:52,096
This is this is open-and-shut Smoking Gun

1794
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:57,472
Marathon

1795
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,384
Open-and-shut case man

1796
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:10,784
We caught video

1797
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,088
I don't think there's any other conclusion

1798
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Provided

1799
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
This case

1800
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Is not opening

1801
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:23,072
Explore with you hear some of the things you need to do even if you're going to listen to

1802
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:27,168
To the way I was

1803
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
He's right okay not

1804
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,360
First you got to figure out who these people are in these photos

1805
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:41,248
Ounces to anyone in this Anonymous intelligent

1806
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:45,600
Does contacting him know who any of these people are

1807
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,624
A hurdle that needs

1808
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,392
Steube hurtled

1809
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,208
That's a problem globulus remove people's names

1810
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:50,976
Whenever they become

1811
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:57,888
Next movies people are if they're willing to submit to an interview you can ask them questions

1812
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:04,288
If Alex

1813
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,848
The cops

1814
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,944
Alex seems to imagine you could just take these out of context pictures to a judge

1815
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:17,856
Or some s*** part of the globalist deal with the Devil is that if you get caught you have

1816
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:20,160
To tell the truth it's a reverse the police have to

1817
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,928
To tell you that

1818
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:28,096
Next Imagine somehow you can tell these people to talk what if no one was ordering them to do

1819
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,656
What evidence

1820
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:36,032
If you guys like Alex thinks or marine Special Ops just said we were at the marathon

1821
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,312
And you think we look weird

1822
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,616
What evidence is going to provide to contradict

1823
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,688
It'll be a disaster of a case to try and prove anyway

1824
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:49,856
It's b******* where outages decided all these connections he's making his head exist in the real world

1825
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
Really is scary

1826
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,976
It's very scary if you imagined amines

1827
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,256
You know like yeah

1828
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,120
You approve any

1829
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,240
Numerous lawsuits in the leg

1830
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,544
It's almost like he really doesn't

1831
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,080
And any of the laws

1832
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,360
Or how court work

1833
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,920
Like he just doesn't have any concert

1834
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
Really shady

1835
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:26,464
It's all we get back now to this theme throughout the episode of Alex wanting a parade for his great

1836
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,536
Breaking the story

1837
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,400
Is going well Alex Jones

1838
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,576
In front of everyone

1839
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
It's not all over the place

1840
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,552
It's not

1841
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:25,344
It's in the ship media online

1842
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,880
New York Post cover

1843
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:33,024
However it's important to point out that the post from the same source that Alex is pulling

1844
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
From

1845
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:39,680
Guilty to similar journalistic operating off bogus emails from actual lawn for

1846
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:42,752
Reporting bad information

1847
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,544
Alex is getting random picture

1848
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,592
Fortune and writing a story about it

1849
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,688
Because Alex gets all of his news from websites that are completely full of s***

1850
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,480
Sensational.

1851
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:56,320
He naturally thinks that the entirety of media is talking about the same thing

1852
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,600
He was covering already

1853
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,160
Just because he

1854
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,184
Conflated these

1855
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:07,328
He saw the post covering also heard that politano

1856
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,888
He doesn't realize that the FBI is now

1857
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,424
Not yet released these images

1858
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,960
So most likely assume

1859
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
Post cover is in

1860
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,776
In fact the release of the suspect picture

1861
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:21,664
Brown people

1862
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
So he thinks that this picture is

1863
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,480
Saudi Arabia

1864
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:27,040
Saint Patty's

1865
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,832
Now that he's blown up the hillbilly gang

1866
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,368
He's further completed

1867
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:35,232
The Saudi student who was injured in the bombing and unrelated Saudi student

1868
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,024
Classes

1869
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,304
Person in order to

1870
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,864
To suggest that the Saudi Arabian Patxi's

1871
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,144
Be taken out of the country

1872
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,472
And that's what this meeting Obama had with the Saudi foreign minister was about

1873
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:51,104
It's really interesting because all the faulty steps who makes it is reporting or pretty clear if you just listen to him

1874
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,152
And have some distance from the actual event

1875
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:56,224
Super easy in 2019 see the glaring holes here

1876
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,784
And how you so eagerly fills them in with the narrative

1877
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,552
His own design

1878
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
Concretely point out these lies

1879
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,720
You could say I don't know if that makes sense

1880
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:10,048
You couldn't say like I don't know he was

1881
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,168
There wasn't going around anxiety

1882
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,960
Confidently makes these dumb-ass assertion

1883
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
It's the duct

1884
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,288
Really one of the worst parts

1885
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,568
Outlook

1886
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,360
Seeing have done what he's saying is

1887
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,896
But seeing how easy it would be to be

1888
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,688
But there's something to it

1889
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,272
I know I'm saying that's kind of consistently repeat

1890
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
Because I think it's

1891
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,064
Important

1892
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,112
I think as we go through this

1893
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,928
Like it's important to not lose track of it

1894
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,976
The climate and how people

1895
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:43,584
How he's willingly and aggressively

1896
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
Manipulate

1897
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
Yeah I think he gave up

1898
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,520
The media isn't

1899
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
Sing Alex Jones

1900
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,568
Of all people

1901
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,592
Is correct on

1902
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,640
That of all people

1903
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,200
Note Cookie generally presents

1904
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,736
Himself is being one hundred percent correct

1905
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,504
All the time

1906
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,064
Forced

1907
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,368
To admit I'm Corral

1908
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,952
Yeah supposed to

1909
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,976
Cuz we both know that

1910
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:14,048
Welbeck

1911
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,632
Expressing

1912
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
The media hates

1913
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:25,056
People about that

1914
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,336
Possible reading

1915
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,896
So Alex

1916
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,968
Fantasy here about how this

1917
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
These pictures

1918
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
Tortured

1919
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,624
It's it's great

1920
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648
Jessica Jones

1921
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,304
About the dude being tortured

1922
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
It's

1923
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:47,840
Got a gross

1924
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,600
He doesn't know

1925
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,416
Electroshock

1926
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,440
Orchard

1927
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,232
Dial

1928
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,304
Just like

1929
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,168
Pictures on

1930
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,928
So bad

1931
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:51,328
You needed the appearance of them

1932
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:57,216
About this a lot of good evidence

1933
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:02,336
Patriot folk are all over the media

1934
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,384
And he doesn't play any clips of that

1935
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,968
I went to Infowars I can't find any articles of them demonstrated

1936
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,904
You've built that up as narrative that they are doing right is now established

1937
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,184
Turn on his own

1938
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,720
Previous

1939
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,328
He needed that

1940
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,680
It's gross is just a match

1941
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:31,520
Images with this guy

1942
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,568
It is decided that he's mentally

1943
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:37,920
Decapped he's decided enlisted by a hero

1944
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:43,040
It has nothing to do with any reality

1945
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,600
Anything Auto

1946
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,416
I'm always

1947
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:50,208
Cuz he because he describes

1948
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
Everybody

1949
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,000
Traits

1950
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,280
To therapy

1951
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,840
Like always

1952
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:59,424
If you think somebody is bad Hillary looks like

1953
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,192
It's like all of that

1954
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
Always

1955
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
Curious of what it is

1956
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
He would describe him

1957
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Himself as

1958
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,080
Looking like

1959
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,104
The mirror

1960
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,408
Like I wasn't in the same way that I want

1961
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,432
Specifics on

1962
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:16,832
Cowboy Calvin Klein bottle

1963
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,368
To be something like that right

1964
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,928
That is how we describe

1965
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,720
How could you possibly

1966
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,768
See that's like that's something that

1967
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:28,352
It's like what is it his eyes

1968
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:35,776
I'd rather not

1969
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
I should correct my

1970
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,688
Alex doesn't

1971
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
Just

1972
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,736
Fantasize

1973
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,040
Is about them

1974
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,600
He also has

1975
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:11,104
Founding

1976
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:22,880
Glitter

1977
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:32,864
In the CFR

1978
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:36,704
So does Gary Hart letter

1979
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,240
Floppy bulshit

1980
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,360
But Alex is talking about

1981
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:47,456
I'm freaking out mostly because I'm not willing to watch truth Rising just to find some

1982
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:50,272
Contacts for what he's talkin about very Hearts react

1983
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:54,368
I'm certain that Alex's embellishing and misrepresenting Gary Hart's reaction

1984
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,648
None of that really matters

1985
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:00,512
On 911 truth.org there's an article about this letter that Gary Hart wrote

1986
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:05,888
The first thing that's important to point out is that it does letter wasn't written for the CFR

1987
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,704
Or anything like that Gary Hart was a member of the

1988
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,264
How far you wrote for the

1989
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,800
Posted September 2000

1990
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,664
The letter is titled quote unsolicited advice for the government of Iran

1991
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:21,504
And what did the support into point out is at this point in 2007

1992
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,808
Things were not good between the u.s. and Iran

1993
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:29,440
In January of that year the US has right had raided the Irani and liaison office in a rock

1994
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,720
Which was serving as the

1995
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,744
Defacto console

1996
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,560
And they took five Consular officers hostage

1997
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:38,656
Which they wouldn't release these dudes until July 2000

1998
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,704
It was super tense

1999
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,264
And hearts letter exists within that

2000
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
Was Iran

2001
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,896
Huffpo

2002
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:56,064
Unsolicited advice to a wrong was that the US does not go to war unless it's provoked

2003
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,392
But sometimes it's

2004
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:02,720
Like certain more hawkish elements like to provoke

2005
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,488
Provocation

2006
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:08,864
But it's important to point out what he's talking about is not false-flag necessarily

2007
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:13,984
He's talking about a advising Iran to avoid giving someone like Dick Cheney

2008
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,008
Juicy's Giant

2009
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:17,568
Define to justify going into another War

2010
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,360
From the letter

2011
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,664
You'd probably be well-advised to keep your Force

2012
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,456
Including clandestine forces

2013
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,248
As far away from the Iraqi border is he

2014
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,064
You might even consider bringing in some neighbors

2015
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,856
To verify that you're not shipping arms

2016
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
Nextdoor

2017
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,416
Tone down the rhetoric on

2018
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:36,768
You've established your credentials with those in your your world who thrive on that

2019
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:41,632
If it makes you feel more powerful to her like his agents at the American Eagle have at it

2020
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
Sticks and Stones Etc

2021
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,752
16 months or so you should not only

2022
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,080
You should not only not take provocative action

2023
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,128
You should not seem to be doing

2024
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,968
For the vast majority of Americans who seek no wider War

2025
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,760
In the Middle East or elsewhere don't

2026
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:02,368
Don't give a certain vice-president we know the justification he seek

2027
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Going to attack York

2028
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,744
This letter in no way of saying

2029
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:10,304
That's an absurd misrepresentation of the message

2030
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,584
That heart was Express

2031
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,120
But that shouldn't be too

2032
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,704
I remember

2033
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
Text daywind

2034
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Ayatollah

2035
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:19,776
I had a

2036
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,544
Unsolicited

2037
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,312
Letter

2038
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,080
Gary Hart

2039
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,872
They just said

2040
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:24,640
Who are you

2041
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:31,296
Actually thought he was Corey Hart I wear my sunglasses at night

2042
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,600
Stop wearing sunglasses at night

2043
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,256
This is bulshit just keep that in mind

2044
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:44,608
Animals

2045
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:46,048
But surprise is nothing more than performative mask

2046
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:49,120
There is no passion behind

2047
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,400
Completely artificial

2048
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,960
And most importantly nothing you saying is true

2049
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:59,360
I guess that he's got to play any of these clips or any other media Outlets

2050
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
And nothing I could find on his websites

2051
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,456
The brew that at all

2052
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,992
He's just playing his role

2053
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,272
Anything else working

2054
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:12,672
August traffic is way off so he's leaving hard into beat you over it

2055
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952
But unfortunately

2056
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,232
Borrowed time

2057
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,512
Because in reality

2058
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,536
You knows that he hasn't

2059
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,304
Predicted anything

2060
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:25,216
Particularly interesting there's how he said that he predicted that the globalist would ban powder from the gun shops there at the end of the

2061
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:26,752
He didn't predict

2062
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,848
If you recall that came from a 4chan post that he read on air

2063
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,408
Whitney Houston to present as a troll

2064
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,456
Bougie started agreeing with as

2065
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,224
Read it

2066
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,808
If anything you should be saying they're blaming the powder from the gun shop

2067
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:42,624
You heard me convinced by a troll post that that was going to happen

2068
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,976
But that doesn't quite sound doesn't roll off the tongue not really

2069
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:51,328
So now in 2019 I can look back in town

2070
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,352
Outlaw powder

2071
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:58,752
Fireworks in can still get fireworks in both places

2072
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:02,080
And places you can't didn't ban the because of the Boston bombing

2073
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:05,920
Did it because some kid lost an arm a decade ago in the city council voted in

2074
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:09,248
Buford Drive to outside City Limits fireworks

2075
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:11,808
Nothing Alex is saying

2076
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:14,112
This is all just performance

2077
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:16,160
Presented as truth because he knows

2078
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:18,464
Traffic is up and he knows what makes him interest

2079
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,768
It's this sort of b*******

2080
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:24,096
Overconfidence I'm right about everything I predicted all this s***

2081
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:26,144
He knows that's the honey

2082
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,192
But he can get people drawing

2083
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,728
I was like when he adds

2084
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,752
It's those tiny little

2085
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,312
Dad said like

2086
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,336
Like

2087
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,384
Going to the bar and watching UFC

2088
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,784
I think somebody in particular

2089
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,856
Brody won't have him on his bro

2090
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:49,440
A little bit of Dante's Inferno whatever he creates all of these

2091
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,864
Pacific Hills in April 8th set with people whose arrival

2092
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:01,216
All the globalist

2093
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:07,616
QFC like

2094
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:14,016
Just feel that way maybe it also falls in line with

2095
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,552
His like anger

2096
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:19,392
Sublimating masculinity

2097
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:25,280
Alex

2098
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:28,352
Democratic fundraising letters

2099
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:31,424
You found it we're going around

2100
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,448
We need another Oak

2101
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,520
This isn't true

2102
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,992
Still have to play any of those clips

2103
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:19,040
So I can

2104
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:25,440
They were ever going to be another Oklahoma City bombing

2105
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,512
There's literally no way I believe that such a thing

2106
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:35,424
I would imagine that with being misrepresented here is

2107
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:38,240
Some organization splc

2108
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:44,640
Sent out a fundraising email to discuss the growing threat of right-wing terrorism not as a positive thing but as a

2109
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,664
Business to keep an eye on

2110
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,736
It makes sense for them to raise money by pointing out that

2111
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:49,760
80s

2112
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:54,112
Tea Party Movement has grown the more dangerous militia communities have grown along with it

2113
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:56,672
Reaching levels unseen since the mid-nineties witch

2114
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,464
Take me to the Oklahoma City bombing

2115
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,816
Analysis track record is littered with him misrepresenting thing

2116
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,840
Things like that

2117
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,864
Probably assume

2118
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,888
That's what he's talking about

2119
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,656
Yeah

2120
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,680
I can type

2121
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:12,800
If they sent that an actual if they literally sent that address thing as a real thing

2122
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,568
We will

2123
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:20,224
Still be hearing it from all of the evidence

2124
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:22,784
It's like everyday

2125
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:29,952
The closest I can find us a couple of comments that people made that were saying that Obama

2126
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,232
Be back in 20

2127
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,584
Smartpen said interference on Hardball

2128
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
Remember president

2129
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:39,936
Remember President Clinton reconnected with Oklahoma

2130
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:42,240
And the president right now seems removed

2131
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,776
It wasn't until

2132
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,824
The Clinton really clicked with the American public

2133
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,616
Obama needs a similar thing

2134
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:51,712
This isn't single mama needs a new Oklahoma City Bombing to save his presidency

2135
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:56,576
It's connected with the American public in that speech after the bombing

2136
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,600
Are Obama needs

2137
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,880
Similarly Rican

2138
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,928
It's not about the terrorist attack

2139
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:01,952
It's about the speech

2140
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:06,816
The other instance was Robert Shapiro's an article in the financial times

2141
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,424
The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership

2142
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:15,008
He has to find Subway between now and November of demonstrating

2143
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:20,128
I'm short of a 911 event or in Oklahoma City bombing

2144
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,920
I can't think of how he could do that

2145
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:29,088
You can read that as a guy saying that Obama better fake terrorist attacks soon or you could read it as a political commentator

2146
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:29,856
Stream examples

2147
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:32,416
Express how bad is situation Obama was in

2148
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:33,440
At the time

2149
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:36,000
MARC Penn, came a couple of days

2150
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,280
After the 2010 mid

2151
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,072
When the GOP

2152
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,096
Control of the house

2153
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,888
I gave six seats in the Senate effective

2154
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,704
Most of the hope that Obama had

2155
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,984
Of having a Cooperative Congo

2156
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:48,800
Political commentator Mike

2157
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,080
60 prospects right then

2158
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:56,224
Shapiro's comment literally says quote between now and November

2159
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,528
And that's referencing that he said this

2160
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,880
Shapiro's articulating that there's a rising

2161
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:05,184
Conservatism happening at the

2162
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,488
Obama's approval rating

2163
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
Falling

2164
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,840
So he's probably going

2165
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:16,704
The only way to read either these comments as expressive been for some

2166
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
Fake terrorist

2167
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:20,288
Is it you're already convinced that that's what the people are

2168
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592
I can't even

2169
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,456
Like if I think about it

2170
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Hard enough

2171
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,296
Obama we had a Democratic president

2172
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:36,928
Supermajority that the House and Senate

2173
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:37,952
Now is

2174
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:39,488
Weld by 30

2175
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,024
Seven Feathers

2176
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:41,792
It's like

2177
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:44,096
We could have ever imagined

2178
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:48,704
Don't even think about it

2179
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,240
It's about a democratic fundraising

2180
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,264
Email or letter

2181
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:59,456
I should tell you that I did find a fundraising letter sent out by then Executive Vice President of the NRA Wayne LaPierre

2182
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,040
6 days before the Oklahoma City bombing in 90

2183
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:06,880
95

2184
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:12,768
Federal agent murder law-abiding citizen

2185
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,560
According to an article in the Chris

2186
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,096
Science monitor about the letter

2187
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:18,656
Mr. LaPierre urges gun owners to

2188
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,728
To take action before there's no Freedom left in America

2189
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:26,336
Obviously the fire Timothy McVeigh blow up the Federal Building

2190
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:28,384
We can be sure of that because of the time I guess

2191
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,920
It doesn't work out

2192
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:32,480
It's tough to get around the fact however

2193
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:35,552
Exaggerated

2194
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,088
Advocacy for gun right

2195
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:37,856
Kind of looks

2196
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,952
Fire Department Federal Building a week later

2197
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:45,536
Oh and I also found an article from the LA Times

2198
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,072
From April 28th

2199
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,096
1995

2200
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:50,144
Just after the Oklahoma City bombing

2201
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,936
Elizabeth damn headline

2202
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:54,496
Oklahoma City after the bomb

2203
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:56,800
Lobbyist stymie efforts to trace

2204
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:58,848
Explosive technology

2205
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:00,128
Such as

2206
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:06,272
Such as the use of gypsum material Define blast origin has been around

2207
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,040
It's usage

2208
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,064
My first thought

2209
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,344
That headline is unwieldy

2210
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:16,256
Someone needed to take another pass that.

2211
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:17,536
You see though

2212
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:19,840
Through these indestructible microscopic

2213
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,864
Call tag

2214
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,400
They can be put in all

2215
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:25,216
Explosive sold in this country

2216
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,752
Any bombs used in the text like

2217
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:32,384
In the 1980s the office of Technology assessment did a study and found that implementing these

2218
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,408
The Titans quotes

2219
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,432
Could increase arrest

2220
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:37,248
Related to bombings by as much as seventy five percent

2221
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:44,160
But you know what that's unilaterally

2222
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:49,792
Ultimately

2223
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,328
Can't imagine why

2224
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:53,888
They're people who are like the group

2225
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,912
That represent

2226
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:58,240
Explosive manufacturers were against it as well

2227
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:01,824
Their reason with explosives for like

2228
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,408
Demolition

2229
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,968
Position

2230
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,504
Adding

2231
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,528
Could make the

2232
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,064
Morphe

2233
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:12,832
Explosives

2234
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:17,184
Other people other people instead

2235
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:21,792
So there's a lot of x-rays aboveboard on

2236
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,144
Anyway when people talk about how the NRA is basically a terrorist organization

2237
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,680
It is some of the reasons

2238
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:30,752
The red the red Rick is indistinguishable from to mess

2239
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,544
The terrorists and their actions

2240
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:34,592
Exceedingly difficult for law enforcement

2241
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:37,152
To solve crimes committed by domestic terrorists

2242
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,688
That's why people think those sorts

2243
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:41,504
You know it's like

2244
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,040
If Isis

2245
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:44,320
Hey

2246
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,088
Don't

2247
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,112
Investigator

2248
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,440
Because that's who they are

2249
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,208
Right

2250
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:55,072
Eventually does get around to saying that people are blaming

2251
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:55,840
Rihanna

2252
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:58,400
Might be the bear is a news

2253
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:01,728
Report about how the NRA blocked

2254
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,520
The efforts to put tag

2255
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,288
Explosion

2256
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:05,824
I'm guessing

2257
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,616
Probably on MSNBC

2258
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,640
Or CNN

2259
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,176
There was a small piece

2260
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:10,944
About this

2261
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,480
History of vodka

2262
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:15,296
Bombing

2263
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,832
Probably super

2264
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
But I don't know if that's

2265
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:20,672
I don't know if he's tagging could have been put in

2266
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:24,768
In fireworks as well I don't know

2267
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,584
If anything it was just a discussion of

2268
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,608
Their advocate

2269
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,680
Making things harder to track

2270
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,240
That's a noble cause.

2271
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,800
Alex Ferris

2272
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:37,824
People more afraid

2273
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,920
Everywhere

2274
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:51,648
Shower

2275
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:58,304
But don't worry

2276
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:10,080
Right now this is more attacks

2277
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,360
Because

2278
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,896
I've blown their operation

2279
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:16,736
Everyone admits that I'm right

2280
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:19,040
It's crazy this is insanely responsive

2281
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:23,392
Freaking out

2282
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,416
Is that

2283
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,208
Harry Reid

2284
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,232
And giving a speech

2285
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,024
Said that we don't need to be

2286
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,048
Got off track

2287
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:33,632
Get distracted by these black helicopter types

2288
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:35,424
Who saved those false flag

2289
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,192
Naturally

2290
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:36,960
Cell course

2291
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
The blackout

2292
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:41,056
Freak the f*** out

2293
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,080
In

2294
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:45,408
Alex's introduction to talk about this he accuses Harry Reid

2295
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,200
Throwing a fit

2296
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:48,480
If you listen to this

2297
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,760
She's giving a very calm

2298
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,576
Alex throws a fit

2299
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,416
This country and everything

2300
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,968
We can keep them off.

2301
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:20,736
Please

2302
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:22,016
We should keep in mind

2303
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:26,624
Organized crime

2304
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,536
Fountain Valentine's Day Massacre

2305
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:37,888
So Congress dramatically Limited

2306
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:39,936
Long time ago

2307
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:43,520
Machine guns

2308
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:45,568
Basically disappeared from history

2309
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,872
Movies

2310
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:57,088
Yes we can and should make the same common-sense approach

2311
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:06,048
Dianne Feinstein

2312
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,096
Because we must strike a better balance

2313
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,144
The right to defend ourselves

2314
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,448
And the right of every child in America

2315
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:22,432
I'll go to the band because he is more important than satisfying conspiracy theories

2316
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:26,016
Helicopters

2317
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:37,792
Operation

2318
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:48,800
Only sort of solution is

2319
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:53,152
Good give me free advertising that's the only solution

2320
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:56,480
How they were at skating for It Go

2321
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:58,784
I mean

2322
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:00,832
This is just further in that

2323
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:02,112
Pattern that Alex has

2324
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:02,880
That like

2325
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,672
This is giving

2326
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:06,208
Very common sense

2327
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:09,024
Measured reaction

2328
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:11,328
Out can't allow that to stand

2329
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,352
It's too sensible

2330
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:14,656
He's already portrayed him having a fit

2331
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:18,496
So he has to keep interrupting that yelling over the cliff otherwise you'll realize he

2332
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,520
He's not at all having

2333
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:22,080
He's completely misrepresenting what this is

2334
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,640
This is this is how Alex DLC content

2335
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,920
Alter

2336
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:27,968
Hey

2337
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:28,736
Alex

2338
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:32,832
Don't talk over

2339
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,392
That's my job

2340
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:38,464
Shots fired

2341
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:44,352
In the hands of schizophrenic so who are on drugs

2342
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:50,240
Continue that line here saying that they're going to have to do another false flag

2343
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,776
Is blown up their original one

2344
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:59,456
Now it's all screwed up by the grace of God

2345
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:03,552
He wanted to frame us

2346
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:07,136
Better

2347
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:27,616
Sure

2348
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:34,528
Motorcycle Waterford

2349
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:40,672
A rare 2013 that was a high-quality

2350
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:46,304
Breath Alex's Day videos no evidence or proof

2351
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,840
Explosion in West Texas

2352
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:49,888
This was

2353
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:56,288
But because he's decided that's how they operate the imaginary enemy I created who

2354
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,056
Always does that

2355
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,872
Demented

2356
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:02,688
Using that very same level of shotty logic

2357
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:09,088
I could just say that one of Alex's Tire

2358
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:12,928
I could just say that the fire was set on the night at the 7th

2359
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:16,256
Set hours earlier on outer shell

2360
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:21,632
Declaring himself

2361
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:26,496
No authority to rule

2362
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:42,368
Obviously I don't think it one of Alex's listeners blew up that fertilizer

2363
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,464
But I want to take this moment to demonstrate the level of inference

2364
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:47,744
Right

2365
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,792
Actually yours makes

2366
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:55,168
Is far more likely but it's not true

2367
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:57,984
How much meth I imagine

2368
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,008
Alex

2369
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,128
Perhaps I don't know this

2370
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:04,896
Could be

2371
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:10,016
So this is kind of gross because at this point in the episode Alex starts sort of trying to reach

2372
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
Playing with a story about the

2373
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:14,624
Child who died in the Boston Marathon

2374
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:17,696
Festool a starts trying to

2375
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:22,048
Emotional about the bombing

2376
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:23,584
Right

2377
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,864
He's trying to

2378
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:25,888
Pretend

2379
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:26,912
He wants to use

2380
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,728
The kids memory for something else

2381
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,800
Rather not talk about that at all Frank

2382
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,104
But it's important

2383
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,384
Because in this clip

2384
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,664
He discusses

2385
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,944
His feelings about

2386
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,992
Sandy Hook in whether or not their actors

2387
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:43,552
And I think you might be surprised to hear where is that at

2388
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:53,536
Calls coming up

2389
02:05:57,376 --> 02:06:03,008
Boston Marathon

2390
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:20,160
Or does it mean that you

2391
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,592
History study criminology

2392
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:44,224
I meant what are you saying is that people who are saying

2393
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:50,624
Reason on your show yesterday

2394
02:06:54,208 --> 02:07:00,352
But Alex is not presented

2395
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:01,888
Since April 1st

2396
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:05,728
Turn on this show

2397
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:09,056
And he's someone who absolutely believe something

2398
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,592
Crazy people

2399
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:16,480
Socrate Alex Salas

2400
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,064
You know talking about this

2401
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,856
Make a pretty gross for Alex to do

2402
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:26,720
As he talks about it a little more

2403
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,768
He begins by bragging about his

2404
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:34,656
Transitory emotional

2405
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:38,752
Okay

2406
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,992
Tea Party

2407
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,808
Can you believe those dirty gun owners

2408
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:55,136
MSNBC was going to come on in

2409
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,608
Commercial

2410
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:30,720
He's mocking an imaginary reporter being a emotionally moved by the death of a child

2411
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:32,768
This is all just in Spanish

2412
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:34,560
F****** person

2413
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:38,656
Who's projecting that sickness on to Scottsboro

2414
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,472
And I disrespected

2415
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:45,056
If we talk about it

2416
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:47,104
The first thing that you should ask

2417
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:49,664
Anybody is like are you proficient at everything

2418
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,272
Includes the one thing they are

2419
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:55,040
Literally

2420
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,600
Incapable of doing which is

2421
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,368
Experiencing

2422
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:02,976
Which is the least empathetic person

2423
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:09,888
Starts

2424
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:13,728
Arguing that these images came out the New York Post are the same as the ones

2425
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:17,568
Has ended the media and the government

2426
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:19,104
The investigators

2427
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,896
Those photos

2428
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:21,664
This whole time

2429
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,944
Time sure

2430
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,248
Eching to release them so they could blame the

2431
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,064
Auburn metallic starts

2432
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,088
These imagine

2433
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:36,512
When the photos of a Navy SEAL

2434
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,304
And the redneck

2435
02:09:56,992 --> 02:10:00,832
First

2436
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:04,160
Adjust just get ready

2437
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:14,144
Too long

2438
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:22,848
That you were looking at things

2439
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,896
Hurt you bad

2440
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:35,392
They have

2441
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:38,464
Close their eyes for one second and that's

2442
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:40,512
She practically

2443
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:43,840
So Alex has more pictures

2444
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:45,632
Of the

2445
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,656
And the marathon

2446
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:47,936
He discusses

2447
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,984
I've been sort of

2448
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:56,128
No no pulling back a little bit of information Coy kind of dunno

2449
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,432
Who cares

2450
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:01,248
Major piece of Alex's narrative

2451
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:06,624
And the whole thing is

2452
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:24,032
Command

2453
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:32,992
Purportedly

2454
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:44,512
First started talking about these pictures of the Marines

2455
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:50,912
There's nothing suspicious

2456
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:51,680
Who cares about that

2457
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:54,240
This is stupid

2458
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:56,032
These people looks

2459
02:11:56,288 --> 02:12:00,640
But I was going to ask and now we got to that point where it Escalade

2460
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:02,688
And it requires a bit of an explanation

2461
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:05,760
Cuz there are the people who are in these pictures

2462
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:07,552
More pictures of come out of them

2463
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:10,624
And they are

2464
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:14,720
So

2465
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:21,120
He could have been radiation

2466
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,472
It's purely based on a couple pictures

2467
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:27,008
Created entire store around

2468
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,288
Tyler Lee Adams on fantasy

2469
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:34,176
More pictures and more information

2470
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:35,712
Really

2471
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:37,760
And now I'm going to lay waste

2472
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:38,528
To all this.

2473
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,320
The first thing

2474
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:43,136
Is that Alex has repeatedly

2475
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:45,440
Suspicions on these pants with backpacks

2476
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:46,208
Because they looks

2477
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:49,536
What are the primary things

2478
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:52,352
Ever caught on camera suspicious

2479
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:55,680
Is that they appear to be distracted and talking on phone

2480
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:59,008
That picture was presented as being before the bombing

2481
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:01,824
Happened

2482
02:13:02,336 --> 02:13:06,944
Their behavior the way they were looking around was used as evidence they knew something was going to

2483
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:07,712
To happen

2484
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:10,784
However later it was revealed that this picture was

2485
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,576
Cropped version of a larger image

2486
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:14,368
If you look at the actual picture

2487
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:16,416
This is very much after the bomb

2488
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:21,280
If you're distracted and not looking at the marathon because

2489
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:23,584
Right right right that's a good reason

2490
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:26,912
Thought

2491
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,728
Hansen shoes

2492
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,080
Asian detector

2493
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,640
That still seems

2494
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,176
Stopwatch

2495
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:41,760
People who

2496
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:44,064
Conspiracy theories that already found the answer to

2497
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:47,136
These men were members of the National Guard

2498
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:52,256
This was reported on CNN on April 15th at 3:45 p.m.

2499
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:55,072
I'm just about an after an hour after the bombs explode

2500
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:57,120
Troops from Massachusetts

2501
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:59,168
It's National Guard were assisting police as well

2502
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:04,544
This naturally raises the question though why is the National Guard on site at the Boston Marathon

2503
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:07,104
You know this would be a good question for Alec

2504
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:10,688
But you so far away from the actual story that he doesn't even

2505
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:12,224
Realize the answers he's demand

2506
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:13,504
Time to go already

2507
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:21,184
On April 18th Sergeant First Class Johnson publishing an article in the Air National Guard website about

2508
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:21,952
Assistant

2509
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:22,720
That's common

2510
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:24,000
Between National Guard units

2511
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:25,024
In particular

2512
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,048
Civil support team

2513
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,096
Which is what these men were members.

2514
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:29,888
Quote the Massachusetts

2515
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:32,448
He was on duty during the running of the Boston Marathon

2516
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,496
Augmented by similar civil support team

2517
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:36,544
From the New York and Rhode Island National Guard

2518
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:41,408
Alex legitimately could have looked at

2519
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,176
Because

2520
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:45,504
Number of these dudes have big letters EST on their back

2521
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,784
Short for civil support

2522
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:50,112
Carnival giveaway

2523
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,672
I guess it'd be easy for Alex

2524
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,440
You just say that it's

2525
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:57,024
The same thing you know I have faith

2526
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,072
Conspiracy theory of these dudes being

2527
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:04,448
They're completely different organization and he's decided there

2528
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:07,776
Probably not

2529
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:09,312
On April 6th

2530
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:10,592
2013

2531
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:15,968
The public information director for the New York State military and Naval Affairs division

2532
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:18,528
Security newswire quote

2533
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:21,856
Anytime you have a high key event where there's a lot of people

2534
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:26,720
There's usually unit from the Civil support team in the area to provide assistance to first responder

2535
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:29,280
It turns out this is a very common

2536
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:32,864
According to an article in the Washington Military department's website

2537
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:38,752
There's civil support team quote support of the presidential inauguration deep Governor's inaugural ball

2538
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:42,336
Seattle Fire and Police at every Seattle Seahawks

2539
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,104
Home game

2540
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:45,152
They also help the Minnesota

2541
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:47,200
Tea do to their increased need for assistance

2542
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,480
During the 2018

2543
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:49,248
Team Super Bowl

2544
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:51,040
All of these events

2545
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:53,344
Other large-scale Gathering

2546
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,368
Police press

2547
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:58,208
And they're regularly augmented by members of the Civil support team

2548
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:04,864
And the only reason this time sticks out in anyone's mind is because it was a time when there was actually a terrorist

2549
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:07,168
Activation

2550
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,448
These teams are

2551
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:11,776
Specifically in specially trained to respond rapidly

2552
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:13,824
2 chemical and radiological Danger

2553
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:16,384
Which is why you see one of them with a radiation

2554
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,664
Detector in one of the pictures

2555
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,200
From right after the bombing

2556
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:20,736
Important

2557
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,016
The security puzzle because

2558
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:24,064
In case the worst thing possible happened

2559
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,856
They're trained and ready to deal with it

2560
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,392
It wasn't the case

2561
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:29,952
What's a marathon

2562
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:33,792
You be thanking your lucky stars that those dudes

2563
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:36,352
Do they could have saved a lot of

2564
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:38,656
This really matter

2565
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:40,704
Alex could still easily say that

2566
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,032
The fact that they were there means

2567
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:45,312
The cfp being there Matt

2568
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:50,688
I guess that's a decent argument if you want to call every Seahawks home game a drill to

2569
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,480
None of this reality

2570
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:56,832
Conspiracy

2571
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:59,392
But it's still important to point out that

2572
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,696
When does episode is being

2573
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:02,464
Recorded

2574
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,488
It's been 2 days

2575
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,768
Send Erik durm

2576
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:06,048
Publicly talked about who these

2577
02:17:06,304 --> 02:17:06,816
These guys are

2578
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:08,352
Is Alex's researching this

2579
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:09,376
Anyway

2580
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,400
He's really into

2581
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:11,936
The truth like he pretends to be

2582
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:13,984
He should know this information by

2583
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:17,056
And you know what's even more interesting

2584
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:19,104
Noted callers notice either

2585
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:21,664
This is very public information

2586
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:25,504
Anything simple Warriors are really digging into the truth like they say they're interested in

2587
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,064
I would expect for them to at least be coming up with cancer

2588
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,112
Pharisees about the correct group of people

2589
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:31,136
But they don't

2590
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:34,720
They just beer back Alex's narrative that these are seals or mercenary group

2591
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:41,120
And you know what I know that this is publicly-available stuff because I only used

2592
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:41,888
Information

2593
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:43,680
That was available by the 8th

2594
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:44,448
Yeah yeah

2595
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:46,752
Looking to who he

2596
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:48,544
Adidas EST

2597
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:49,568
Like it

2598
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:51,872
It's crazy like I just

2599
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:53,664
Express

2600
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,688
How stupid

2601
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:55,968
Alex being like

2602
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,904
Demand answers

2603
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,976
Right

2604
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:10,304
But you never see any Islamic leaders

2605
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:14,656
Condemning radical Islam after a terrorist was very much the same phenomena

2606
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,192
The same ship

2607
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:17,216
See what you want

2608
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:18,752
You're not looking for answers

2609
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:20,032
You're looking for your knee

2610
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:23,360
Honestly before you even told me

2611
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:26,944
It's really interesting really glad I learned

2612
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:32,320
If you would said that he thought he had a photo where they were using a radiator

2613
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:34,624
My first thought is like

2614
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,160
This is just like those old

2615
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:38,720
Tiny photographs where it looks like a guys holding up a

2616
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:39,744
Cell phone but that's

2617
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:40,512
Actually what I'm hearing

2618
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:41,536
Look like

2619
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:43,584
Whatever you say it is

2620
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:53,312
Is that they were just like off duty military people there who were they are for the Bob

2621
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,592
Director at the time Craig

2622
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:56,896
Fugate said in an interview was that

2623
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:02,016
Came out around that time for

2624
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:02,784
From a different

2625
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:05,088
Exactly

2626
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:07,136
His point was it like when you have

2627
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:07,904
Tragedies

2628
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:11,744
First Responders in our mind our paramedics

2629
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:13,536
Police but awesome

2630
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:16,608
In reality First Responders are people who are there

2631
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:23,264
You know like Yeah The First Responders

2632
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:26,336
You know if the reality wasn't these word

2633
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,104
The cftc

2634
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:27,872
Team members

2635
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:29,152
Medford

2636
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,688
CIT members

2637
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:32,480
Yeah

2638
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,760
If they work

2639
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:37,344
We're just off duty military people you could still see you like

2640
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:40,672
Their first responding they have some sort of training

2641
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:42,720
The police might enlist one of them too

2642
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:46,304
To carry a radiation thing around

2643
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,632
Off-duty is not

2644
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:51,168
Just going to be like

2645
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:53,216
And head home

2646
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:00,128
Pretty much

2647
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:02,176
Explain why a lot of Alex's

2648
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:05,504
Today's photographs

2649
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:08,576
This also explains why

2650
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:09,344
No one

2651
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,880
Interested in these photos

2652
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:15,232
Because anybody

2653
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:21,376
Drive me crazy

2654
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:22,400
Soul Train

2655
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:26,752
Enough

2656
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:29,056
A maddening is Philip a catastrophe like

2657
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,360
Known

2658
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:32,128
It's no

2659
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,664
It's not like this is

2660
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:36,992
Closely-guarded Secret

2661
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:37,760
Army birthday

2662
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:43,648
I think it's frustrating just because of the immediacy

2663
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,672
Of it in a

2664
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:46,976
And that we've been

2665
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:49,792
On this long roller

2666
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:50,560
Coaster ride Avenue

2667
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,656
I think it's like any but it's like any historian being like

2668
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:56,448
Seriously

2669
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:01,056
The Civil War was about states rights

2670
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:04,896
The goddamn

2671
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:12,064
It's right there if the added frustration to Lexington be like

2672
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:17,696
Stopped like information is available someone could have

2673
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:24,096
Me too much because I know how good Alex is at this job

2674
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:26,144
Also know that the Cs

2675
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:27,680
He does do training

2676
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:29,472
Like they train local police

2677
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:30,752
Apartments for

2678
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:31,520
For some

2679
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:32,800
Of the

2680
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:34,592
Preliminary stuff

2681
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:39,200
Because that's also part of their mandate

2682
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:45,600
I could easily see Alex being like people there for exercise

2683
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:46,624
Conspiracy

2684
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:48,416
I don't know

2685
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:49,952
I just I wish

2686
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:50,720
I wish

2687
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:53,536
I honestly.

2688
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,072
I would like to

2689
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,192
That would be nice

2690
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:00,960
That would be nice

2691
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:03,008
So Alex is mad

2692
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:05,056
Because

2693
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:08,128
Tampa dondi to Boston

2694
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:09,408
Do y'all at the

2695
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:10,432
Press conference

2696
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:11,456
Derails

2697
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:12,736
And rightfully

2698
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:13,504
People are not

2699
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,576
People are like this is bulshit

2700
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:19,648
This is disruptive behavior this guy is full of s***

2701
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:22,976
Answer he's mad particularly at Glenn Beck

2702
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,768
Pretty cool

2703
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:43,200
Scum

2704
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,736
Bus come

2705
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:49,344
Broadcast

2706
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:54,720
It says there was security people there

2707
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:03,936
He's such a bad man

2708
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:10,080
Hate to agree with line back but no kidding when you're right you're right to the Somali pirates

2709
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:10,848
When they know what they're too

2710
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:17,504
Toronto predicting that all the people in the pictures that he promoted and put out are probably

2711
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:20,064
Be killed

2712
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,600
Is real nut

2713
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:41,824
These pills were actually CST

2714
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:46,176
Who is

2715
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:46,944
Answer this nose

2716
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:47,968
About already

2717
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,248
Hey this is just

2718
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:50,784
This is just

2719
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:54,368
How do I Alex's they're convinced that these are not

2720
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:56,672
Civil support team

2721
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:57,952
He doesn't know anything

2722
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:02,816
Feels but she'll probably

2723
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:05,376
Higher-level that even Green Berets

2724
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:08,448
Because there are levels higher than Green Beret and Alex

2725
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:11,520
Has a great you can prove it

2726
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:17,152
Unintended

2727
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:39,680
Most accurate

2728
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:46,848
Looking out like that

2729
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:48,384
This is so bad folks

2730
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:49,664
This is so bad

2731
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:53,504
Yes that is bad that's bad very bad

2732
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:59,904
Yeah maybe there are but your evidence of it the best

2733
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,256
Stop

2734
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:05,792
I would love to

2735
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:11,424
I would challenge Alex to redo his career

2736
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:16,800
With the stipulation the movie

2737
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:23,200
You can never use a movie of evidence for your b******* ideas

2738
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:24,736
Sure you know Alexa

2739
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:29,344
So Allison is a pump-up speech that is great

2740
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,880
We all love a little bit of

2741
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:32,928
Passion

2742
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:36,256
What you can do is

2743
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:38,560
Makes a one-to-one connection between

2744
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:41,376
And subscribing to

2745
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:42,912
To his version of Christianity

2746
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:50,080
Join me in the feelings are running

2747
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:56,480
Grow up

2748
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:09,280
And declare your Independence declare your Independence

2749
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:15,424
Atomic level

2750
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,824
Will will work its will upon the world being free isn't it

2751
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:44,608
I know universe will open up and the Living Water of Jesus Christ will float

2752
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:49,216
Sound of the time-space Continuum and you will truly be free

2753
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:49,984
Wow

2754
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:56,896
You see though there's this like explicit connection between his political ideas

2755
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:00,736
Voorhees f*****-up version of Christy

2756
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:02,784
It's very it's very

2757
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,320
Clear in moments like that

2758
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:07,136
Without a semi-regular basis

2759
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:08,160
Like that

2760
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:09,440
That explicit connect

2761
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:10,464
Has drawn

2762
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:14,816
It's troubling

2763
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:16,352
Post info

2764
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,144
All he's got to do is

2765
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:19,680
Just added a bunch of those type of

2766
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:21,728
And he's got the next

2767
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:22,752
Best selling self

2768
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:23,776
Right

2769
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,568
Like that sounds so much like a

2770
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,360
Can Eckhart Tolle but with

2771
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:32,992
Talking rock music behind it instead of soothing maybe they interesting

2772
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:37,088
Isaac is next best idea would be like

2773
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:38,112
No

2774
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:39,136
Never the answer

2775
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:44,768
It would be to just be like okay I realize that the political sphere is never going to

2776
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:46,304
To save the world from the globalist

2777
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:48,352
Ironmaster

2778
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:51,680
I don't think that's likely but

2779
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:58,848
It's like Kid Rock going

2780
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:04,224
Add cash grab sort of thing

2781
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:08,064
One of our recent episodes

2782
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,880
Present I can't quite remember

2783
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:12,416
But I was talking about

2784
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:14,976
How God was talking to him

2785
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:18,816
But he also said could be God could be myself subconscious

2786
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:21,120
Yeah you're right

2787
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:21,888
Wichita

2788
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:22,656
Very true

2789
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:26,496
Because of mixing up.

2790
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:28,032
It is an issue

2791
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:29,312
This next clip

2792
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:30,592
Presented even bigger

2793
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:40,064
Give me energy

2794
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,328
You're not but also Alex can't tell the difference

2795
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:53,376
Between the devil and his subconscious

2796
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,936
So now is he has a

2797
02:28:56,192 --> 02:29:02,336
Or feeling or premonition notion

2798
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:06,176
That's really bad

2799
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:11,040
This is bananas but

2800
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:13,344
He reminds me so much of Crunk

2801
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:19,488
Emperor's New Groove when he's got the little angel in the demon

2802
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,328
Like he's just unaffected by either they're both saying nonsense and he's like

2803
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:26,144
Yeah my nonsense to whatever and they just move on

2804
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:31,776
That's so he's literally talking about having a little angel

2805
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:33,824
Tell you music

2806
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,104
She's just a symptom of

2807
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:41,504
Probably just the difference between what's going on

2808
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,880
God is telling him that he's doing such a shity job but he thinks

2809
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:51,232
The devil the difference between Patrick Warburton in a cartoon

2810
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:53,280
Is it Alex

2811
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:55,584
As a radio show any other religious

2812
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,376
F****** Zealot and right-wing

2813
02:29:57,632 --> 02:30:03,776
That's an issue

2814
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:05,568
Find it hard of gold

2815
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:10,944
On this side

2816
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:16,832
Episode

2817
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:18,368
Get the pictures

2818
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:19,648
Aren't really the suspect

2819
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:21,440
And that the New York Post

2820
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:24,768
Recover was a f******

2821
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:26,816
Alex's real fluid

2822
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:28,096
So it's alright

2823
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:32,192
I found a news article from the New York Magazine

2824
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:36,288
Claiming the fazenda pictures of the two suspects coming out today

2825
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:41,664
This news article it's not claiming that the suspects are

2826
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:42,944
The two suspects

2827
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:45,248
Enviro in always pictures

2828
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:49,856
It's going to be two other suspects and these two suspects in the picture is gone viral

2829
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:52,928
The guy in the blue jacket is actually a teenager

2830
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:55,744
Running on his

2831
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:57,792
Schools track

2832
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:00,352
And the Guyanese white hat

2833
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:03,936
And Black Backpack is actually attract coats

2834
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:10,336
Forward

2835
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:18,528
They're going to

2836
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:23,136
Suspicious cribs

2837
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:28,512
Suspiciously do that

2838
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:30,560
Have any focus on at all

2839
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:35,168
Is the people who actually you know there is footage of them dropping the backpacks

2840
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:35,936
Despot

2841
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:37,472
Yeah it pretty hard

2842
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:40,800
Hard to get around evidence

2843
02:31:41,056 --> 02:31:41,824
Perpetrators

2844
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:45,664
Weird weird that outside of all the pictures and show.

2845
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:47,712
Mysterious leaks at the correct

2846
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:48,992
Man that's

2847
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:50,016
That's

2848
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:51,808
Impervious

2849
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,880
Pervious armor

2850
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:59,488
Any evidence that you're wrong is a cover-up that

2851
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,768
It's just added into the

2852
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:02,560
The churn because they wanted

2853
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:03,328
Tiff Buchan

2854
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:04,096
Painted on this way

2855
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:04,864
White redneck

2856
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:06,400
Alex

2857
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:11,008
All of this up this is

2858
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:28,928
Next

2859
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:33,792
Now

2860
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:36,352
Be part of a special program to help America

2861
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,216
America

2862
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:46,848
I mean it's just so sick

2863
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:52,992
This is one of this episode particularly in this stretch of time was like

2864
02:32:53,248 --> 02:32:54,016
Really laborious

2865
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,064
Because Alex is

2866
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:58,368
Kind of being affected by the lack of information

2867
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:00,672
Yeah like he's able to spend

2868
02:33:00,928 --> 02:33:01,696
Do you like

2869
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:08,352
Yoda pretending that the New York Post cover is the official thought we were right all along

2870
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:09,376
Parade

2871
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:13,472
The little stick

2872
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:14,496
Like

2873
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:20,128
It deteriorates into constant just like him making stuff up about what must have happened

2874
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,432
Flights of Fancy that he has about

2875
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:24,224
These guys being chosen

2876
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:25,248
A season like

2877
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:26,784
It's just like

2878
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:30,880
He he's suffering from the same problem that they're mainstream media is because

2879
02:33:31,392 --> 02:33:34,976
As creative as he is his creativity is kind of hit a wall

2880
02:33:35,232 --> 02:33:37,024
Oh yeah and that does make this

2881
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:37,792
A bit more of a

2882
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:39,072
What's log to get through

2883
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:41,120
The same time I was right

2884
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:42,144
Noises that like

2885
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:43,168
He's getting a lot of

2886
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,192
Call sis

2887
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:45,472
Thanos

2888
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:46,240
Like this is

2889
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:48,544
The iron is hot right now

2890
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,824
So you can't do anything

2891
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:18,752
Grandbabies

2892
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:30,784
Next Hitler propaganda

2893
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:33,600
They're not going to use the chair

2894
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:35,392
You know that Alex embellishes

2895
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:38,208
Just about everything but

2896
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:39,232
I complete

2897
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,816
Like I said he is getting some new stations

2898
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:45,632
Because of the increased

2899
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:49,216
Yeah yeah

2900
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:52,544
Kind of becoming a really hot item

2901
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:55,104
$8 people on the internet

2902
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:55,872
Interested

2903
02:34:56,128 --> 02:34:56,640
Information

2904
02:34:59,456 --> 02:34:59,968
This app

2905
02:35:00,224 --> 02:35:02,784
Since this vacuum real official information

2906
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,320
Is making people lose their mind

2907
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:07,392
And Alex is capitalizing on that

2908
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:08,416
It's really

2909
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,976
Overdrive

2910
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:13,792
2 calls

2911
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:14,816
Some more calls

2912
02:35:15,328 --> 02:35:17,120
We're going to enter.

2913
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:18,912
Where we get to see just how

2914
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:19,936
F****** stupid

2915
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,704
Alex Isley

2916
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:24,288
Hate to say that I don't like to judge

2917
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,360
Individuals as much as I Judge Alex

2918
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:29,920
But some of these people are profoundly.

2919
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:33,248
And I know that part of it is raining that Alex

2920
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,296
You know like he doesn't

2921
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:36,576
Watch out of them

2922
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:37,856
E-rewards

2923
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,392
Stupid

2924
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:40,160
Speculation

2925
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:43,232
And so that behavior is reinforced

2926
02:35:45,536 --> 02:35:46,048
That

2927
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:48,096
Is first one just call her

2928
02:35:48,352 --> 02:35:52,192
Suggest that we need vigilante Posse used to go around and arrest cops

2929
02:35:54,752 --> 02:35:56,544
Alex is dead.

2930
02:35:57,824 --> 02:36:03,968
People with power and the other constituents

2931
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:05,248
You see people break in the car

2932
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:07,296
250 people breaking the law

2933
02:36:21,376 --> 02:36:24,704
Trip

2934
02:36:41,088 --> 02:36:42,880
Galaxy's respond to that is probably

2935
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:49,280
About as good as you can do on Infowars

2936
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:52,096
Reform is very needed

2937
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:53,888
Going in assaulting a cop

2938
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:55,680
Under citizen's arrest

2939
02:36:55,936 --> 02:37:00,032
Is absolutely the wrong tactical decision

2940
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:04,384
I don't think you're going to be able to grab even the most corrupt cop

2941
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:07,712
Even the most corrupt

2942
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:11,296
Take them to the police station and have all the other cops be like

2943
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:18,208
Thank you we didn't have the courage to do it ourselves I think

2944
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:21,792
Even if you have a roving band of good guy

2945
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:23,840
It's going to cause trouble

2946
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:25,632
What if we ever had a rope

2947
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:30,496
Roving bands are usually

2948
02:37:32,544 --> 02:37:34,336
Like there's a lot of historical precedent

2949
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:38,432
Call Iran

2950
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:44,320
Never one I wanted to tell you to your listeners that I watched I've listened to you for over 3 years

2951
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:47,904
I have read probably 50 books as a result of listening to you

2952
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:50,464
I can tell your listeners out there that Infowars

2953
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:55,328
Is an extremely credible organization in the fact that you do things on such an evidence-based

2954
02:37:55,584 --> 02:38:00,960
Approaching the news and stuff I totally agree with I'm an attorney

2955
02:38:01,216 --> 02:38:05,056
So I take that very seriously and I appreciate what you do I don't know if their cousin

2956
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:08,896
Some questions about the

2957
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:13,248
Beatbox

2958
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,784
I've watched 50 movies

2959
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:19,648
Probably

2960
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:22,720
Your approach to the news you just proved everything

2961
02:38:23,232 --> 02:38:27,584
This is sad but that's the perception that outputs out by the audience

2962
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,864
They accept

2963
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:34,752
Yeah

2964
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:36,800
You're the hero for Americana

2965
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:39,360
Next caller

2966
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:41,920
But maybe he's just saying bulshit

2967
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:44,224
Able to record

2968
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:50,112
BB in South Boston ABC owned and operated affiliate ABC

2969
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:50,880
5

2970
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:53,440
In one of their reporters a compass.

2971
02:38:54,464 --> 02:38:55,232
Said that

2972
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:56,512
The head of FEMA

2973
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:58,048
Craig Fugate

2974
02:38:58,304 --> 02:39:01,888
Call Mary

2975
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:06,496
That's good for

2976
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:13,152
FEMA director Craig on April 15th

2977
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:16,992
Administrator of FEMA Richardson

2978
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:22,624
Lessons Learned From the Boston Marathon

2979
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:25,440
Switch was released

2980
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:26,464
2013

2981
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:28,512
In their introduction to the report

2982
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:33,888
Sereno says quote I was in Boston on that tragic day in April celebrated in my hometown

2983
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:35,936
And I'm here now.

2984
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:38,752
FEMA deputy director administrator

2985
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:42,080
But also as a Bostonian and former paramedic

2986
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:44,640
Patriots

2987
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:45,664
He's from

2988
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,456
Austin so he went home to celebrate

2989
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:48,480
That makes sense

2990
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:51,808
There's nothing in this report about Fugate also being in Boston

2991
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:52,576
When the attack happened

2992
02:39:53,856 --> 02:39:57,696
I can find literally no indication that the actual director Craig Fugate wasn't Boston

2993
02:39:57,952 --> 02:39:59,488
The time

2994
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:05,376
There is proof that the bombing was a FEMA false

2995
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:08,704
Scholars just f****** up with a detailed

2996
02:40:09,216 --> 02:40:12,032
He's really just talking about Serena being there

2997
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:13,056
Suspicious

2998
02:40:13,312 --> 02:40:14,848
Boston

2999
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:17,920
Everybody knows that team officials

3000
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:19,712
Do not have any private lives

3001
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:23,040
As whatsoever they were grown from a lab until they don't have any

3002
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:24,576
Any hometowns other than

3003
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:26,112
I don't know where ever

3004
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:27,648
Sad amphibious Izar

3005
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:31,744
Right now there's no way

3006
02:40:32,256 --> 02:40:33,536
For a FEMA official bee

3007
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:38,656
Anywhere in quarters where I assume they live in

3008
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:41,728
You also like we have to assume that

3009
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:43,264
You know I found this conspiracy

3010
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:45,312
A Blog about Richard Serena being

3011
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:48,128
Fugate was also there you'd have

3012
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:49,920
Have to assume that that would be a part of the

3013
02:40:50,176 --> 02:40:50,944
Conspiracy theory

3014
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:52,224
It's on this blog

3015
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:59,136
Because you got somebody

3016
02:40:59,392 --> 02:41:01,952
You can't was there

3017
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:05,536
So here in this next clip I think we have

3018
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:06,304
What

3019
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,328
Alex Gibbs

3020
02:41:08,352 --> 02:41:09,376
Close to a mission

3021
02:41:09,632 --> 02:41:10,144
Statement

3022
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,704
Doing

3023
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:13,472
Right now

3024
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:15,776
It's f***** up

3025
02:41:32,928 --> 02:41:34,720
It's about controlling the narrative

3026
02:41:35,232 --> 02:41:35,744
End

3027
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:42,144
All good and well in your mind when he's talking about

3028
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:42,912
Patriotism

3029
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:47,264
Control the narrative to drive traffic to a website

3030
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,032
Pre-sales

3031
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:50,848
But the narrative he's pushing

3032
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:51,872
Is b*******

3033
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:53,920
There's nothing behind any of

3034
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:57,504
All the things about the pictures that he's found

3035
02:41:58,016 --> 02:41:59,552
There's an accurate explanation

3036
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:01,088
Just about everything

3037
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:03,904
There's nothing suspicious except for what he's imagine

3038
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:05,440
He's not pushing

3039
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:06,208
A journal

3040
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:07,232
Narrative

3041
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:09,536
He's not pushing an investigation narrative

3042
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:10,816
He's pushing his fantasy

3043
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:12,352
He's pushing his

3044
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:13,120
Perception

3045
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:14,144
His

3046
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:15,168
Storyline

3047
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:16,960
He's come up with validate

3048
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:18,752
The idea that the federal government is

3049
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:19,520
Is evil enough

3050
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:22,336
Crosswhite gun-owning Patriots

3051
02:42:23,104 --> 02:42:26,688
This always doing for him

3052
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:27,968
Is evil

3053
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:30,272
It's propaganda it's misleading

3054
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,416
Is it man there's just

3055
02:42:38,976 --> 02:42:40,768
Flaw within our brain that is

3056
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:41,536
Not going to be

3057
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:44,608
Like it it's like these guys

3058
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:46,656
Spin fix

3059
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:49,728
Convince

3060
02:42:49,984 --> 02:42:51,008
A large enough people that

3061
02:42:52,544 --> 02:42:53,056
To be Danger

3062
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:55,104
Herzl

3063
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:55,872
Dangerous

3064
02:42:56,128 --> 02:43:00,736
I think monsters I think a lot of it comes down to very unique.

3065
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:04,832
There are not many people who could put

3066
02:43:05,088 --> 02:43:06,112
Perform on the level that he

3067
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:07,904
Their terms of like

3068
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:11,488
He makes himself such a clown in order to be that like

3069
02:43:11,744 --> 02:43:14,304
Thing that seduces people in with the entertainment value

3070
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,352
And then they keep watching

3071
02:43:16,864 --> 02:43:20,448
Vague references to things never explained

3072
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:21,472
Never actually

3073
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:23,776
No documents are approved

3074
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:24,544
Is enough to be

3075
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,640
In the aftermath of the bombing

3076
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:30,688
He's able to use real-world events

3077
02:43:30,944 --> 02:43:32,992
And incorporate them really quickly

3078
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:35,808
Into proving the narratives that he's laying out

3079
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:37,344
Like if you were list

3080
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,624
Link to all this you were

3081
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:40,160
Maybe thinks Alex is inert

3082
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:42,208
Listening

3083
02:43:43,232 --> 02:43:44,512
Like a lot of your suspicions

3084
02:43:44,768 --> 02:43:46,816
My Google doesn't know what he's talking

3085
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:50,144
Is he interaction with the real world in a way

3086
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:51,936
Vicky's presenting

3087
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:53,728
Reinforcing his world

3088
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:55,264
But actually doesn't

3089
02:43:55,776 --> 02:43:56,800
That's part of his

3090
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:58,336
Other people can't do that

3091
02:43:58,848 --> 02:44:00,128
Like I just don't have those skills

3092
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:04,736
Contemporaries

3093
02:44:05,248 --> 02:44:06,784
Maybe not but I mean there's always one of these

3094
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:09,600
Like these guys are as like every

3095
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:12,160
Seems like every generation

3096
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:13,440
Has their own one of these

3097
02:44:14,208 --> 02:44:15,744
Can a permutation sir

3098
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,280
So it's it's just like

3099
02:44:18,304 --> 02:44:19,072
Continues on this

3100
02:44:19,328 --> 02:44:20,352
Vicious cycle of

3101
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:21,888
Bulshit

3102
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:23,680
Disseminated by two people

3103
02:44:23,936 --> 02:44:24,448
We've by enough

3104
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:25,728
To turn

3105
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:28,032
Bulshit into something that is real in

3106
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:30,336
And

3107
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:39,552
It's

3108
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:42,112
I don't know what to tell you

3109
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:45,952
It turns out

3110
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:46,976
That

3111
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:49,536
You know how your IQ your intelligence quotient

3112
02:44:50,304 --> 02:44:52,864
Don't people have this

3113
02:44:56,704 --> 02:44:59,776
That you can actually will your IQ to rise

3114
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:04,384
Call

3115
02:45:06,176 --> 02:45:08,224
Praise God

3116
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:22,048
You just got up

3117
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:28,448
Slug

3118
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:34,592
So you guys raise your IQ do you want to just

3119
02:45:35,616 --> 02:45:36,128
Focus

3120
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:42,272
It works you can also accept Jesus Christ into your heart

3121
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:44,832
Ray's BBQ

3122
02:45:45,088 --> 02:45:46,112
Is your IQ absolutely

3123
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:47,904
You know what I can

3124
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:48,928
Kiwis or how to

3125
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:49,952
Measure it

3126
02:45:50,208 --> 02:45:50,720
No

3127
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:52,256
But I imagine he

3128
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:54,560
Probably doesn't think much of his audience

3129
02:45:54,816 --> 02:45:57,120
A lot of Ember probably pretty

3130
02:45:58,912 --> 02:45:59,424
To be smarter

3131
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:04,031
So appeal to that idea

3132
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:13,247
So my IQ

3133
02:46:13,759 --> 02:46:16,319
Is that whatever I find Alex lying about something

3134
02:46:17,855 --> 02:46:19,135
I've given myself a little point

3135
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:26,559
About to rise by 1

3136
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:31,167
TJ

3137
02:46:39,103 --> 02:46:43,711
When is the show incredibly obvious

3138
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:47,295
Anybody

3139
02:46:47,807 --> 02:46:49,855
Alex

3140
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:54,975
According to the after-action report of the Boston Marathon

3141
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:59,071
Did partnership by all manner of Massachusetts law enforcement in public

3142
02:46:59,583 --> 02:47:00,351
Thanks for not being

3143
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:05,983
79 report in the section titled cook areas needing Improvement

3144
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:07,775
They discussed security limitation

3145
02:47:08,543 --> 02:47:14,687
The area surrounding the Finish Line in Boston in the starting line in Hopkinton

3146
02:47:14,943 --> 02:47:16,479
Risk than other public viewing areas

3147
02:47:16,735 --> 02:47:18,527
A screen for the presence of contaminants at

3148
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:20,319
Devices several times during the day

3149
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:22,367
Interpret rule by law enforcement personnel

3150
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:24,415
However these areas are open to

3151
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:25,183
To the public

3152
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:29,279
Are heavily populated and no screening of persons or baggage is

3153
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:30,047
Conducted

3154
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:35,167
The report itself wrestles with how security protocols could be put in place that wouldn't complete

3155
02:47:35,679 --> 02:47:36,447
Destroy the marathon

3156
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:40,799
Because the Boston Marathon is a large public family event

3157
02:47:41,055 --> 02:47:42,591
There needs to be an appropriate balance

3158
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:44,895
Security protocols

3159
02:47:45,663 --> 02:47:46,431
Ultimately

3160
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:49,247
Some suggestions like prohibiting bags in certain places

3161
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:51,039
Or increased police presence

3162
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:52,575
But it stresses a second

3163
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:53,599
Quote

3164
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:56,159
These protocols should not be so intrusive at 2

3165
02:47:56,415 --> 02:47:57,439
To change the feeling of the

3166
02:47:58,463 --> 02:48:01,023
Alex is just making up the idea that all bags are screen

3167
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:02,047
In order to read

3168
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:02,815
Horses

3169
02:48:03,071 --> 02:48:03,583
Conspiracy

3170
02:48:03,839 --> 02:48:06,143
There's someone had a bomb in a backpack there

3171
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:06,911
The cops would have

3172
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:07,679
After no

3173
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:09,471
And have to let them in with

3174
02:48:09,983 --> 02:48:11,519
This is absolutely not true

3175
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:13,823
He is lying to as he has put it

3176
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:15,359
Control the narrative

3177
02:48:16,127 --> 02:48:16,895
That's all this is

3178
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:18,175
How long is

3179
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:20,735
6

3180
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:22,271
26.2 MI

3181
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:25,599
Yeah it's okay

3182
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:26,367
Alarm

3183
02:48:26,623 --> 02:48:27,135
Even then

3184
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:27,903
If your

3185
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:28,671
Talking about Target

3186
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:29,439
Did near the Finish

3187
02:48:30,207 --> 02:48:30,975
You can walk

3188
02:48:32,511 --> 02:48:33,023
Such fun

3189
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:34,559
It's just like

3190
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:35,839
TSA worth

3191
02:48:36,095 --> 02:48:38,399
Even their report at least

3192
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:39,935
A balance between

3193
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:42,751
Giant dumb over-reaction

3194
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:45,567
Theater in order to

3195
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:46,591
Yorkshire Oliver

3196
02:48:47,615 --> 02:48:50,175
Watch them

3197
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:57,343
Alex's recognized

3198
02:48:57,599 --> 02:49:00,927
Can go with the information that he has available to him

3199
02:49:01,183 --> 02:49:02,719
Like all Vicky

3200
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:05,791
Respond so far the staring at random photos

3201
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:06,559
4chan

3202
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:08,607
He's gotten about as much mileage is

3203
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:11,167
So what do you need to be audience to do

3204
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:13,471
Is go find local footage

3205
02:49:15,007 --> 02:49:16,543
And come up with things

3206
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:17,567
For him to talk about

3207
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:37,023
Probably

3208
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:49,055
Probably

3209
02:49:49,311 --> 02:49:50,335
Define

3210
02:49:50,591 --> 02:49:52,639
Defeat the enemy by finding

3211
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:54,431
Maybe bad reporting

3212
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:55,967
In the immediate aftermath

3213
02:49:56,223 --> 02:49:56,735
Fake people

3214
02:49:57,247 --> 02:50:01,599
Reporting things capriciously

3215
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:02,879
Approve my up one

3216
02:50:03,135 --> 02:50:09,279
Literally all he's doing cartoons together

3217
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:10,303
Make me look right all the time

3218
02:50:11,071 --> 02:50:11,583
Please

3219
02:50:11,839 --> 02:50:12,351
F***** up

3220
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:16,447
No that's just not okay

3221
02:50:16,703 --> 02:50:19,263
That's like Barnes allowing people to vote

3222
02:50:19,519 --> 02:50:20,287
Do you like

3223
02:50:20,543 --> 02:50:21,823
There's just something very wrong

3224
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:31,295
Center for legal

3225
02:50:31,551 --> 02:50:32,575
It might not be not sure

3226
02:50:32,831 --> 02:50:34,367
It's at least in Africa

3227
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:41,791
And that is he turns over the show did David Knight host for a while

3228
02:50:42,303 --> 02:50:46,143
And Alex said he knows that the press conference

3229
02:50:46,655 --> 02:50:47,167
Coming up

3230
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:48,447
Is that a little

3231
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:52,287
Play some jazz

3232
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:57,407
More phone calls

3233
02:50:57,663 --> 02:51:03,807
And in a press conference with Obama in an hour and a half

3234
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:10,207
The new maps already discredited

3235
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:10,975
Come out with

3236
02:51:13,791 --> 02:51:14,303
It's so fun

3237
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:15,583
He doesn't even

3238
02:51:16,863 --> 02:51:18,911
He doesn't even need to talk about whether or not

3239
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:21,471
His pets for the right ones

3240
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:22,751
Doesn't matter

3241
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:24,031
Here are their New Path

3242
02:51:25,567 --> 02:51:30,943
Normally you know what I would do is David Knight Jakari Jackson

3243
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:34,783
But the press conference is coming up while the show is still going to be

3244
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:35,551
Be going

3245
02:51:35,807 --> 02:51:39,647
And I know because I live in 2019 conference

3246
02:51:39,903 --> 02:51:41,183
Crucially important piece

3247
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:41,951
Of this

3248
02:51:42,207 --> 02:51:45,791
And I needed reaction would be

3249
02:51:49,119 --> 02:51:50,655
And so I decided to keep listening

3250
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:52,703
While David Knighton Jakari Jackson house

3251
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:55,007
And someone that's very interesting is that Alex

3252
02:51:56,543 --> 02:52:02,687
Doesn't really leave the studio honestly think that he might be

3253
02:52:03,455 --> 02:52:04,991
Like it might be a 2030

3254
02:52:05,247 --> 02:52:06,271
Team drunk out

3255
02:52:06,527 --> 02:52:09,343
Because he cannot stop barging into the studio

3256
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:12,159
Is interrupting that while they're trying to do their show

3257
02:52:12,415 --> 02:52:16,767
Becky rise

3258
02:52:17,023 --> 02:52:18,047
And I was just yelling in the

3259
02:52:18,303 --> 02:52:18,815
Studio

3260
02:52:35,967 --> 02:52:36,735
Ottoman

3261
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:41,599
No you're not

3262
02:52:41,855 --> 02:52:45,951
He's not getting out of there either I love how we leave these

3263
02:52:46,207 --> 02:52:46,975
Piles of vitamin

3264
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:51,071
Mad

3265
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:54,399
She's so they because they're not great

3266
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:55,167
At this point

3267
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:57,471
David Knight Jakari Jackson are not

3268
02:52:57,727 --> 02:53:01,055
Super gummy David nightstand evergood in before

3269
02:53:01,311 --> 02:53:03,871
Do you ever got too much exposure on the actual Alex

3270
02:53:05,663 --> 02:53:08,479
But they're not good there

3271
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:10,527
And one thing I will say to their credit

3272
02:53:11,039 --> 02:53:14,623
Along with the callers

3273
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:15,647
Technicolor

3274
02:53:15,903 --> 02:53:17,951
The collar will say something for like 2 minutes

3275
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:18,975
Analysis

3276
02:53:19,231 --> 02:53:23,327
410

3277
02:53:23,583 --> 02:53:24,607
Alright make a point

3278
02:53:24,863 --> 02:53:31,007
Will say something and then next caller like it's actually how a call-in show is supposed to go

3279
02:53:31,519 --> 02:53:33,567
Unfortunately

3280
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:35,615
Unfortunately

3281
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:37,919
They're still Infowars caller

3282
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:39,455
So they're still

3283
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:40,479
Very stupid

3284
02:53:41,247 --> 02:53:43,551
Also I wanted to let everybody know that you know

3285
02:53:44,063 --> 02:53:44,831
You better understand

3286
02:53:45,343 --> 02:53:50,463
Alex Jones doesn't just pull all the stuff from his rear end I mean he gives you the tools

3287
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:52,767
To give you all the evidence you need

3288
02:53:53,791 --> 02:53:59,167
A lot of these are all these other media sources they don't do that they don't give you the store

3289
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:01,471
Police are arguing that

3290
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:04,287
No Alex has a shell he's a

3291
02:54:04,543 --> 02:54:08,127
He's a misinformation

3292
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:14,015
You just need to look into it and I just want to say I appreciate

3293
02:54:14,271 --> 02:54:15,807
And I love you guys

3294
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:17,599
So stupid

3295
02:54:17,855 --> 02:54:22,719
Even in 2013 every f****** word is hyperlink to a source

3296
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:27,071
If you go to if you read any article on Guardian

3297
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:33,471
Hyperlink to the source that proves the reason the word Charlotte

3298
02:54:38,847 --> 02:54:39,359
Bulshit

3299
02:54:39,871 --> 02:54:40,639
Absolutely not true

3300
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:42,431
But this next caller

3301
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:45,503
Is stupid in a way that I actually find

3302
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:46,783
Repulsive

3303
02:54:47,807 --> 02:54:53,439
I was calling about the guy you have a picture of its carrying that the radiation detector

3304
02:54:53,695 --> 02:54:57,791
Yeah he went on Wolf Blitzer and his name is dr. David King

3305
02:55:01,631 --> 02:55:06,751
But fear The Situation Room for yesterday about 6:35 Eastern Time

3306
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:08,287
He was on there with him

3307
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:11,359
And I eat claims that he left the race before the explosion

3308
02:55:12,127 --> 02:55:18,271
Situation

3309
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:21,343
So

3310
02:55:22,367 --> 02:55:23,135
As always

3311
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:24,671
Alex's callers or Ashoka

3312
02:55:24,927 --> 02:55:25,439
Case of stupidity

3313
02:55:25,951 --> 02:55:27,999
Alex has trained his audience to trust their guts

3314
02:55:28,255 --> 02:55:29,791
Just make connections between any

3315
02:55:31,839 --> 02:55:32,863
So when they call in

3316
02:55:33,119 --> 02:55:34,399
That's all they operate on

3317
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:36,191
It's tremendously dangerous

3318
02:55:36,703 --> 02:55:38,239
Alex doesn't really have a heist

3319
02:55:38,495 --> 02:55:39,519
Standard for what information

3320
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:40,543
He'll just repeat

3321
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:42,079
But you've seen these things

3322
02:55:42,335 --> 02:55:44,639
Snowball

3323
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:45,919
In this case

3324
02:55:46,175 --> 02:55:47,711
This caller is completely wrong

3325
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:51,295
Dr. David King was a person who was on Wolf Blitzer

3326
02:55:51,551 --> 02:55:55,903
But he's not the person in Alex's photo

3327
02:55:56,159 --> 02:55:58,975
Nor does anybody else

3328
02:55:59,231 --> 02:56:01,279
Who has any interaction with Infowars

3329
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:03,583
The story is callers trying to pitch

3330
02:56:03,839 --> 02:56:04,863
Is a disgrace

3331
02:56:05,119 --> 02:56:05,631
To dr. King

3332
02:56:06,143 --> 02:56:06,911
He should be ashamed of

3333
02:56:07,679 --> 02:56:08,703
For saying something like this

3334
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:11,263
A nationally syndicated show with literally no Eva

3335
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:14,335
King's wife was an avid Runner

3336
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:16,639
And she previously ran in the Boston Marathon

3337
02:56:17,407 --> 02:56:18,943
What gear do you want along to watch

3338
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:19,711
Finish Line

3339
02:56:19,967 --> 02:56:23,295
He saw the looks of accomplishment in people's faces

3340
02:56:23,551 --> 02:56:24,831
So why did he just loved it

3341
02:56:26,623 --> 02:56:28,927
They look like they belong on a weedeater

3342
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:30,463
Every last one

3343
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:32,511
So he decided to do it himself

3344
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:34,047
Feeling

3345
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:36,351
Marathon

3346
02:56:36,607 --> 02:56:38,143
And finished about an hour before the bomb

3347
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:38,911
Light off

3348
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:41,983
He lingered while to watch other Runners complete their racing

3349
02:56:42,239 --> 02:56:43,007
MCD excitement in

3350
02:56:43,263 --> 02:56:44,287
Exuberance in their face

3351
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:45,055
How many left

3352
02:56:45,567 --> 02:56:50,431
On his way home news broke about the bonds and he immediately headed for Massachusetts General Hospital

3353
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:52,735
He did that because he's a trauma search

3354
02:56:53,503 --> 02:56:58,879
This man has just finished running a marathon and he selflessly went immediately to try and help victims of the attack

3355
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:05,791
I don't know everything about dr. David King but his actions in the aftermath of the Boston bombing of the sorts of things you could easily described is

3356
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:07,327
Acts of every man hero is

3357
02:57:08,095 --> 02:57:11,423
When he could have easily just rationalize going home to shower or saying

3358
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:17,823
I literally just ran a marathon other doctors someone else will help

3359
02:57:21,919 --> 02:57:24,991
This caller is randomly decided that he's the person in one of Alex's

3360
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:27,551
Does pictures because of a slight physical similarity

3361
02:57:29,599 --> 02:57:33,951
King story of heading right

3362
02:57:34,207 --> 02:57:34,719
Because the photos

3363
02:57:35,231 --> 02:57:36,511
You there at the scene of the bombs

3364
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:37,791
F*** this caller

3365
02:57:38,047 --> 02:57:43,423
Just a repeat the claim without looking

3366
02:57:44,191 --> 02:57:45,983
Without even knowing what they're doing

3367
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:48,287
They're trying to turn euro into a villain

3368
02:57:48,543 --> 02:57:50,335
The person of their Noble

3369
02:57:50,847 --> 02:57:53,919
All the name of making their conspiracy sound more plausible

3370
02:57:54,431 --> 02:57:54,943
This is

3371
02:57:55,199 --> 02:57:55,711
Basketball Behavior

3372
02:57:55,967 --> 02:57:57,247
And I cannot stress that enough

3373
02:57:57,759 --> 02:57:59,295
All of these people should be deeply ashamed

3374
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:02,879
Themselves his collar should still feel bad about this to this day

3375
02:58:03,135 --> 02:58:04,159
And yet they never will

3376
02:58:06,719 --> 02:58:07,231
For them

3377
02:58:07,487 --> 02:58:10,303
Doesn't feature the feature film is always turning

3378
02:58:10,815 --> 02:58:12,863
The people who exercise

3379
02:58:13,631 --> 02:58:14,655
Empathy

3380
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:17,727
Initiative

3381
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:19,263
Villain

3382
02:58:19,519 --> 02:58:21,823
Because what they are is people who

3383
02:58:22,591 --> 02:58:23,103
And don't

3384
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:25,663
You don't like the way they treated

3385
02:58:26,943 --> 02:58:28,735
Story of shahrazad

3386
02:58:28,991 --> 02:58:29,503
Dad

3387
02:58:29,759 --> 02:58:30,527
And all of his Acts

3388
02:58:30,783 --> 02:58:31,295
Heroism

3389
02:58:31,807 --> 02:58:34,623
And then and then you see what they're doing to him

3390
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:36,415
That's part of the goal

3391
02:58:36,671 --> 02:58:41,791
Yeah people are Heroes that you want to follow those well it's it's

3392
02:58:42,047 --> 02:58:44,607
Gyros

3393
02:58:45,887 --> 02:58:48,703
Narrative writing

3394
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:53,823
Control the narrative antihero is heroes are bad for

3395
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:54,591
To the narrative

3396
02:58:55,615 --> 02:58:57,151
So I just really f******

3397
02:58:58,431 --> 02:58:59,967
It does it drives me up a wall

3398
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:02,783
Like David King date exactly what you would

3399
02:59:03,039 --> 02:59:03,551
Applaud

3400
02:59:03,807 --> 02:59:04,319
Someone doing

3401
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:07,391
Award for

3402
02:59:08,159 --> 02:59:10,207
And here he's being painted as

3403
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:12,767
A conspirator in a plot

3404
02:59:13,023 --> 02:59:14,047
To bomb

3405
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:14,815
Civilian

3406
02:59:15,839 --> 02:59:17,375
Another stupid caller calls

3407
02:59:18,143 --> 02:59:23,519
My cousin just called me less than an hour ago there has been a bomb threat at Cal State Los Angeles

3408
02:59:24,287 --> 02:59:26,335
Cal State Los Angeles can we get on that guy quiz

3409
02:59:26,591 --> 02:59:32,735
They are evacuating the school

3410
02:59:32,991 --> 02:59:35,807
Call me to tell me that they are closing

3411
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:41,695
I want to take that totally fair this caller isn't as stupid as all the others

3412
02:59:41,951 --> 02:59:43,487
Because that is a real thing

3413
02:59:43,743 --> 02:59:49,887
Allstate on April 18th

3414
02:59:51,423 --> 02:59:52,959
It was almost certainly the result of a

3415
02:59:53,215 --> 02:59:55,007
Prank call phoning in a fake bomb threat

3416
02:59:55,263 --> 02:59:57,055
Would you like something

3417
02:59:57,311 --> 02:59:58,079
What's Administration

3418
02:59:58,847 --> 03:00:01,919
Ignore

3419
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:03,199
You know what Jordan

3420
03:00:03,711 --> 03:00:04,991
Some people probably don't want to stay

3421
03:00:05,247 --> 03:00:06,015
Think about is the Thera

3422
03:00:06,271 --> 03:00:08,063
F*** ton of people who call in bomb threats to

3423
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:08,831
Schools

3424
03:00:09,343 --> 03:00:13,695
The Educators school safety Network do study on the phenomenon

3425
03:00:13,951 --> 03:00:15,487
It's really scary to think about

3426
03:00:15,743 --> 03:00:17,791
Obviously almost always a fake threat

3427
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:21,119
But it's still such a horrible sort of prank for a person to pull

3428
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:23,423
And to imagine that so many people choose to do it makes

3429
03:00:23,679 --> 03:00:24,447
Me feel real bad

3430
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:25,471
About Humanity

3431
03:00:26,239 --> 03:00:28,031
He found it in the 2015 20

3432
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:28,799
16 School

3433
03:00:29,823 --> 03:00:30,847
Their work 12:00

3434
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:33,407
67 bomb threats made to US schools

3435
03:00:33,919 --> 03:00:35,199
There were 206

3436
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:36,991
Since January 2016 alone

3437
03:00:37,247 --> 03:00:38,271
Which comes out to about

3438
03:00:39,039 --> 03:00:39,551
School day

3439
03:00:39,807 --> 03:00:43,135
That's a reality that school administrators around the country just have to live with it

3440
03:00:43,391 --> 03:00:43,903
Deal with

3441
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:46,207
We end up hearing about almost none of these

3442
03:00:46,463 --> 03:00:50,047
Refilling a slot in Lake local news program

3443
03:00:50,815 --> 03:00:55,423
Is Cason Cal State is only something that because it happened after the Boston

3444
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:58,495
The people are eating up any kind of bomb related to

3445
03:00:58,751 --> 03:00:59,775
Wondering if there's a connection

3446
03:01:00,031 --> 03:01:03,103
Had the suspect made it all the way across the country

3447
03:01:04,383 --> 03:01:07,199
My heart goes out to the students at Cal State that had to go through this

3448
03:01:07,711 --> 03:01:08,991
Obviously is not

3449
03:01:09,503 --> 03:01:10,271
Something you want to have

3450
03:01:10,527 --> 03:01:11,295
After experience

3451
03:01:11,551 --> 03:01:14,879
But the story being introduced into Alex's show can only do harm

3452
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:16,159
There's no reason for this

3453
03:01:16,415 --> 03:01:16,927
He brought up

3454
03:01:19,231 --> 03:01:22,815
This is never happened in all four years I've been here

3455
03:01:23,327 --> 03:01:29,471
Great dude still relevant

3456
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:34,335
I also feel a little bit bad about calling him stupid college kid

3457
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:35,871
The real world

3458
03:01:36,383 --> 03:01:39,455
Is robust

3459
03:01:39,711 --> 03:01:40,735
Developing

3460
03:01:41,503 --> 03:01:43,295
And I understand that the outsized important

3461
03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:44,575
4 years to a college

3462
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:51,487
Compared to somebody who is

3463
03:01:51,743 --> 03:01:52,511
If you are in college

3464
03:01:52,767 --> 03:01:54,303
And you have been there for 4 years

3465
03:01:54,559 --> 03:01:57,375
You should at least have learned by now that for years is not that big of a mess

3466
03:01:58,911 --> 03:02:00,447
It also is still stupid

3467
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:04,031
So

3468
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:09,151
There's no dumb f*** color

3469
03:02:09,663 --> 03:02:12,223
Yes sir I just have one question about Boston

3470
03:02:12,735 --> 03:02:17,599
If we had all these police when they're hungry

3471
03:02:17,855 --> 03:02:20,927
Oh no

3472
03:02:25,535 --> 03:02:30,399
I don't know cuz we've heard the reports.

3473
03:02:30,655 --> 03:02:33,983
Was in the Army I believe he's a job in the Army and he was

3474
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:38,079
His brother-in-law before the bombs went off so

3475
03:02:45,247 --> 03:02:48,063
I know that he's asking a question to David Knight

3476
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:50,879
But I think I might be better equipped to field it

3477
03:02:51,903 --> 03:02:53,951
Generally speaking if practice a journalist

3478
03:02:54,207 --> 03:02:58,047
Not the name all the people who were injured in the situation like this to protect their privacy

3479
03:02:58,815 --> 03:03:01,887
A number of folks made the choice to be identified

3480
03:03:04,447 --> 03:03:06,751
I would assume that they would

3481
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:10,591
The choice to discuss their injuries

3482
03:03:10,847 --> 03:03:13,407
That's likely to Santa could possibly feel like an attempt to make the

3483
03:03:13,663 --> 03:03:14,687
The story about themselves

3484
03:03:15,199 --> 03:03:15,711
Maybe

3485
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:18,527
Police officers would be more likely to not want that kind

3486
03:03:19,551 --> 03:03:20,063
I don't know

3487
03:03:20,319 --> 03:03:23,903
It's very difficult to trace down the identities of all the

3488
03:03:24,159 --> 03:03:25,183
I think that's a good thing

3489
03:03:25,439 --> 03:03:27,487
Leave these people to f*** alone they've been through enough

3490
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:33,119
All that being said I can still tell displaying mouth collar that he's a f****** idiot

3491
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:36,447
A USA Today story from April 15th

3492
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:37,727
The day of the bombing

3493
03:03:38,239 --> 03:03:39,007
Literally says

3494
03:03:39,263 --> 03:03:42,847
Bloody Spectators were treated to a medical tent for runners

3495
03:03:43,103 --> 03:03:44,639
At least one police officer was her

3496
03:03:45,151 --> 03:03:51,295
So there we go we got it in your cop buddy

3497
03:03:51,551 --> 03:03:57,695
Now what does the bombing somehow make your paranoid delusions of the globalist pulled other agent

3498
03:03:57,951 --> 03:03:58,719
Would get her go away

3499
03:03:58,975 --> 03:03:59,999
Of course it doesn't

3500
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:01,535
These aren't sincere

3501
03:04:01,791 --> 03:04:02,303
Question

3502
03:04:02,559 --> 03:04:04,351
Their conspiracy bulshit pretending to be

3503
03:04:04,607 --> 03:04:05,119
Curiosity

3504
03:04:05,375 --> 03:04:07,679
This whole doesn't want to know if any cops got injured

3505
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:12,799
He wants to inject the idea that none work to reinforce the idea that there was

3506
03:04:13,055 --> 03:04:13,567
The false flag

3507
03:04:14,079 --> 03:04:17,407
That's why Jakari immediately start to talk about radu's brother

3508
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:22,015
Because that's the Infowars

3509
03:04:22,527 --> 03:04:24,575
Meanwhile at least one cup

3510
03:04:24,831 --> 03:04:29,183
It was reported three days prior to them being on Eric here

3511
03:04:29,695 --> 03:04:33,023
And approve s*** about Rodgers brother

3512
03:04:33,279 --> 03:04:35,327
You might actually pentahydrate before all we know

3513
03:04:35,583 --> 03:04:37,119
This all amounts to nothing

3514
03:04:39,423 --> 03:04:39,935
Even if

3515
03:04:40,703 --> 03:04:41,471
Shikari or David

3516
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:42,495
New

3517
03:04:42,751 --> 03:04:44,799
Fitness USA Today article exist

3518
03:04:45,055 --> 03:04:46,591
It says one cop was injured

3519
03:04:46,847 --> 03:04:47,871
It's in their best interest

3520
03:04:48,127 --> 03:04:48,895
Did not know that

3521
03:04:51,199 --> 03:04:54,271
Don't ask questions you don't want to actually know the answer

3522
03:04:54,527 --> 03:04:56,831
Is advantageous

3523
03:04:57,343 --> 03:05:01,183
Evan in Fort Worth

3524
03:05:01,439 --> 03:05:07,583
Could you have read this article displaying math idiot calls in and he's like

3525
03:05:07,839 --> 03:05:11,423

Live coverage

3542
03:06:20,287 --> 03:06:20,799

3543
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:22,079
He's probably drunk

3544
03:06:22,591 --> 03:06:24,639

3545
03:06:24,895 --> 03:06:26,943

3550
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:39,999
LPS

3552
03:06:42,815 --> 03:06:43,583
I don't know if you guys

3553
03:06:44,607 --> 03:06:46,655
Watch this video on YouTube

3554
03:06:46,911 --> 03:06:48,447
Message to humanity

3555
03:06:49,727 --> 03:06:51,519
Are you

3556
03:06:51,775 --> 03:06:56,383
Or is Justin Avenue

3557
03:06:58,687 --> 03:06:59,199
Original

3558
03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:03,039
Message to humanity and it

3559
03:07:06,623 --> 03:07:09,183
What's the video about

3560
03:07:09,951 --> 03:07:11,231
Talking about

3561
03:07:11,487 --> 03:07:13,279
Dictator

3562
03:07:19,423 --> 03:07:21,727
3 minute 30 second clip

3563
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:25,311
That's

3564
03:07:25,567 --> 03:07:27,359
Insane it's literally

3565
03:07:27,871 --> 03:07:30,943
Pulling a quote a little clip from Charlie Chaplin

3566
03:07:31,199 --> 03:07:31,967
Charlie Chaplin

3567
03:07:32,223 --> 03:07:35,807
The dictator dictator

3568
03:07:36,063 --> 03:07:39,903
But just callers informed about

3569
03:07:40,159 --> 03:07:43,999
You've already deduced is just a little clip from Charlie Chaplin's Great Dictator

3570
03:07:44,511 --> 03:07:46,559
The f****** movie came out

3571
03:07:47,071 --> 03:07:50,143
It also was nominated for four Oscars

3572
03:07:52,191 --> 03:07:58,335
That video gets passed around a lot and there's no reason for let's

3573
03:08:03,455 --> 03:08:05,759
People forget

3574
03:08:07,807 --> 03:08:08,831
Clip comes from a full-length

3575
03:08:09,087 --> 03:08:09,599
Movie

3576
03:08:09,855 --> 03:08:14,207
And that the speech being given its at the character is a Jewish man pretending

3577
03:08:14,463 --> 03:08:15,999
To be a character who's clearly

3578
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:18,559
It's not Hitler

3579
03:08:19,839 --> 03:08:22,399
It is not subtle.

3580
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:27,519
Actually the character of Hitler

3581
03:08:27,775 --> 03:08:28,287
Is that right

3582
03:08:28,543 --> 03:08:29,055
Anyway

3583
03:08:29,311 --> 03:08:31,615
Is one of the most enduring pieces

3584
03:08:31,871 --> 03:08:34,431
Comedic satire of fascism in authoritarian rulers

3585
03:08:34,687 --> 03:08:36,991
Released in the f****** middle of World War II

3586
03:08:37,503 --> 03:08:40,319
And it's pretty amazing that needed the car your day would really seem to read

3587
03:08:41,599 --> 03:08:44,671
About it's also pretty available this caller doesn't know who

3588
03:08:44,927 --> 03:08:47,999
Unclear about whether or not he was watching something

3589
03:08:48,255 --> 03:08:49,279
These colors are so f******

3590
03:08:49,535 --> 03:08:52,351
Stupid I know I know

3591
03:08:52,607 --> 03:08:53,631
I don't want to be

3592
03:08:56,191 --> 03:08:56,703
Kid

3593
03:08:56,959 --> 03:08:57,983
For not knowing that

3594
03:08:58,495 --> 03:09:02,847
I get that but that's like it's it's like dragon on people

3595
03:09:03,103 --> 03:09:09,247
McCartney guys going to be famous now because of Kanye or something like that

3596
03:09:15,903 --> 03:09:19,231
Your mom

3597
03:09:19,487 --> 03:09:20,767
You're mocking a Lac

3598
03:09:21,023 --> 03:09:21,535
Of Interest

3599
03:09:22,047 --> 03:09:22,815
This person is

3600
03:09:23,071 --> 03:09:26,143
Charlie Chaplin

3601
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:27,935
Which he saw on the internet

3602
03:09:28,191 --> 03:09:30,239
Yes finding out who Charlie Chaplin

3603
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:34,591
Is one click away.

3604
03:09:34,847 --> 03:09:36,383
Hey y'all heard of Charlie Chaplin

3605
03:09:36,895 --> 03:09:38,687
Call Infowars about it

3606
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:45,087
That is worth Market that impulse is worth I know I want to be I want to be kind

3607
03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:47,391
I'm running Santa

3608
03:09:47,903 --> 03:09:48,415
Yeah

3609
03:09:48,671 --> 03:09:52,511
Also when I sit back and I can kind of understand how like the guardian David

3610
03:09:52,767 --> 03:09:57,631
Were people to work for a fascist cleaning propaganda Outlet Explorer

3611
03:09:57,887 --> 03:10:04,031
Fascism satire

3612
03:10:09,919 --> 03:10:10,431
Another

3613
03:10:10,687 --> 03:10:11,455
Stupid caller

3614
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:12,991
Spider-Man

3615
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:21,439
Calling in to make sure people were informed of the act of 1871

3616
03:10:24,255 --> 03:10:26,303
States into a corporation

3617
03:10:27,071 --> 03:10:29,887
Two constitutions

3618
03:10:30,655 --> 03:10:32,447
The organic Constitution

3619
03:10:33,471 --> 03:10:34,495
Has the heart

3620
03:10:37,311 --> 03:10:38,847
The act of 1871

3621
03:10:39,615 --> 03:10:41,407
Yes sir

3622
03:10:47,295 --> 03:10:48,575
Evans Scholars is stupid

3623
03:10:49,855 --> 03:10:52,159
Steven

3624
03:10:54,975 --> 03:10:58,815
I really don't have time to get into the ins-and-outs of this

3625
03:10:59,839 --> 03:11:01,887
Capitalize letters

3626
03:11:02,143 --> 03:11:03,167
That's soda bottle shaped

3627
03:11:03,423 --> 03:11:08,287
I honestly don't even care about this like if you look into it at all you just end up on dumb f*** blogs and Messi

3628
03:11:08,543 --> 03:11:12,895
Message boards of people talk about how sneaky the Rothschilds are

3629
03:11:13,407 --> 03:11:16,479
Deactivate 1871 just created the District of Columbia

3630
03:11:16,735 --> 03:11:17,759
They didn't create a new car

3631
03:11:18,015 --> 03:11:24,159
The tuition for the US in fact the District of Columbia was created the way it was specifically because of Article 1 Section 8

3632
03:11:24,415 --> 03:11:25,183
Constitution

3633
03:11:25,695 --> 03:11:26,975
And by that I mean the real

3634
03:11:27,231 --> 03:11:30,047
Katusha

3635
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:32,351
Which is what this fiery is off

3636
03:11:35,679 --> 03:11:36,191
Sucks

3637
03:11:36,447 --> 03:11:37,983
It makes so much sense

3638
03:11:38,239 --> 03:11:39,007
Sovereign citizen

3639
03:11:39,263 --> 03:11:40,543
Are both the dumbest

3640
03:11:40,799 --> 03:11:41,567
And most vile

3641
03:11:41,823 --> 03:11:42,847
Like those two half

3642
03:11:43,103 --> 03:11:43,615
2

3643
03:11:47,199 --> 03:11:48,223
Venn diagram

3644
03:11:50,527 --> 03:11:52,319
So we get to the press conference

3645
03:11:52,831 --> 03:11:55,135
Pretty short

3646
03:11:57,951 --> 03:12:00,255
Images

3647
03:12:00,511 --> 03:12:03,327
It was not meant to be a half hour after I already

3648
03:12:03,583 --> 03:12:07,167
And so here is the immediate response

3649
03:12:07,679 --> 03:12:08,959
From David and scary Jack

3650
03:12:09,471 --> 03:12:10,751
Right after the press conference

3651
03:12:12,543 --> 03:12:14,079
The FBI agency

3652
03:12:14,335 --> 03:12:20,479
These are the only images that you need to focus on these two guys out of everybody in the crowd

3653
03:12:23,551 --> 03:12:29,695
I didn't point it out we have other images on infowars.com Duran images on other sites that may not be on infowars.com

3654
03:12:32,255 --> 03:12:33,535
Included in the

3655
03:12:33,791 --> 03:12:34,815
In the in the bombing

3656
03:12:35,071 --> 03:12:36,607
What do you say

3657
03:12:36,863 --> 03:12:39,167
He's not talk about me you talk about that

3658
03:12:39,423 --> 03:12:41,471
Listen to that Prescott

3659
03:12:42,239 --> 03:12:43,775
I could already tell how he's going to land

3660
03:12:44,031 --> 03:12:45,567
From like a spin perspective

3661
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:49,151
Richard Delores of the Boston FBI

3662
03:12:49,407 --> 03:12:50,687
Pretty sure I'm still mispronounce

3663
03:12:51,199 --> 03:12:54,271
But maybe less so than what I thought it was Jeff laureus

3664
03:12:54,783 --> 03:12:56,063
Anyway you takes the podium in

3665
03:12:56,319 --> 03:12:59,391
Explain conductor the very intense investigation that are confident

3666
03:12:59,647 --> 03:13:00,927
Pictures of the correct stuff

3667
03:13:01,695 --> 03:13:05,791
Photographic evidence of one suspect place in his backpack

3668
03:13:06,047 --> 03:13:06,559
Precise location

3669
03:13:06,815 --> 03:13:07,583
Some of the site of the second

3670
03:13:07,839 --> 03:13:09,887
Explosions and other footage of the two suspects

3671
03:13:10,143 --> 03:13:11,167
Text walking together

3672
03:13:11,423 --> 03:13:15,519
And you know obviously they wouldn't have released pictures because

3673
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:16,287
That would have

3674
03:13:16,799 --> 03:13:18,079
If they didn't know

3675
03:13:18,591 --> 03:13:19,615
Pretty certainly

3676
03:13:23,967 --> 03:13:28,575
In his prepared remarks he asked for the Public's help in identifying 22 people in these picture

3677
03:13:29,087 --> 03:13:30,367
But also says that other

3678
03:13:30,623 --> 03:13:33,183
Our pictures people are circulating are not relevant

3679
03:13:33,439 --> 03:13:35,743
And focusing on them doesn't help them get to the bottom

3680
03:13:36,767 --> 03:13:38,047
I strongly suspect

3681
03:13:38,303 --> 03:13:42,911
Did the internet

3682
03:13:43,167 --> 03:13:45,727
As much as it was a polite f*** you to the New York Post

3683
03:13:45,983 --> 03:13:47,775
For the cover image with two incorrect

3684
03:13:50,591 --> 03:13:55,967
But I knew as soon as it came out of his mouth with the real if it's been was going to be that the man doesn't want you looking

3685
03:13:56,223 --> 03:13:57,503
Kathy's forbidden images

3686
03:13:57,759 --> 03:13:58,783
I tell you the true story

3687
03:13:59,551 --> 03:14:00,319
And I almost

3688
03:14:00,575 --> 03:14:01,087
Gas

3689
03:14:01,343 --> 03:14:02,623
When Tampa dondi

3690
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:05,439
Infowars having other pictures

3691
03:14:05,695 --> 03:14:06,207
In the background

3692
03:14:06,719 --> 03:14:07,231
At that Prescott

3693
03:14:07,743 --> 03:14:11,327
He was there yelling BFDI press conference

3694
03:14:11,583 --> 03:14:12,607
I should have realized

3695
03:14:13,119 --> 03:14:15,679
You know I really should have

3696
03:14:17,215 --> 03:14:20,287
He could be in that boat forgot that you was in Boston of course

3697
03:14:20,543 --> 03:14:24,127
I'm completely immersed in this stuff even for me

3698
03:14:24,383 --> 03:14:25,919
Interacting with

3699
03:14:26,175 --> 03:14:27,711
Interfering with the really important

3700
03:14:27,967 --> 03:14:28,735
Real world MoMA

3701
03:14:29,503 --> 03:14:34,623
You know it's it's one thing for Alex to manipulate and lie to everyone about highly emotional and sensitive

3702
03:14:35,135 --> 03:14:36,927
But I was thinking about this moment

3703
03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:41,535
And What official Infowars employee

3704
03:14:42,047 --> 03:14:43,071
Disruptive Federal

3705
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:45,375
It was an impotent

3706
03:14:45,887 --> 03:14:47,167
It's not like there's really anything

3707
03:14:49,983 --> 03:14:51,263
It gets to be a public nuisance

3708
03:14:51,775 --> 03:14:54,591
And he's hoping to derail the FBI's investigation into the

3709
03:14:56,127 --> 03:14:59,455
He could pretend like he's doing it because he knows the real truth about the case

3710
03:14:59,711 --> 03:15:01,247
Tension is the same

3711
03:15:01,503 --> 03:15:04,831
His efforts are explicitly directed at creating publicity stunt

3712
03:15:05,087 --> 03:15:06,623
To get attention off the real stuff

3713
03:15:07,903 --> 03:15:08,415
And that's fun

3714
03:15:08,671 --> 03:15:09,183
Act up

3715
03:15:09,439 --> 03:15:11,231
I don't know that the crime but it feels like

3716
03:15:11,743 --> 03:15:13,279
Borders on obstruction

3717
03:15:16,351 --> 03:15:17,375
I don't know how much

3718
03:15:20,703 --> 03:15:23,519
Yeah

3719
03:15:23,775 --> 03:15:25,055
They would have to know that they weren't

3720
03:15:25,311 --> 03:15:25,823
Ethereal

3721
03:15:26,847 --> 03:15:27,359
Which

3722
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:28,639
They do so

3723
03:15:29,151 --> 03:15:29,663
I think it is

3724
03:15:31,199 --> 03:15:33,503
I don't I don't I don't know

3725
03:15:33,759 --> 03:15:35,295
It just say when you look into that prison

3726
03:15:35,807 --> 03:15:36,575
This action

3727
03:15:37,087 --> 03:15:37,855
A lot worse

3728
03:15:38,879 --> 03:15:40,927
Studio

3729
03:15:41,183 --> 03:15:41,951
And

3730
03:15:42,207 --> 03:15:44,511
Yelp

3731
03:15:44,767 --> 03:15:45,279
And their cover-up

3732
03:15:45,535 --> 03:15:46,047
I imagine he

3733
03:15:46,303 --> 03:15:47,583
He tears his shirt open and

3734
03:15:50,911 --> 03:15:51,423
Might as well

3735
03:15:52,191 --> 03:15:57,311
All right now

3736
03:16:00,127 --> 03:16:01,151
Weave

3737
03:16:01,407 --> 03:16:07,551
Courthouse

3738
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:11,647
They are in disarray right now

3739
03:16:14,975 --> 03:16:21,119
That is the good news

3740
03:16:30,591 --> 03:16:31,615
Thank you Alex

3741
03:16:35,967 --> 03:16:36,735
Yeah yeah

3742
03:16:37,247 --> 03:16:40,831
All right there you go Alex Jones 7 p.m. central Infowars Nightly News

3743
03:16:41,087 --> 03:16:46,207
Alex reneges on that that booking a little bit later tonight

3744
03:16:50,047 --> 03:16:51,839
Little bit later he barges back in

3745
03:16:55,167 --> 03:16:56,191
Questioning

3746
03:17:01,311 --> 03:17:06,943
Okay Adam

3747
03:17:07,199 --> 03:17:13,343
Play right there at

3748
03:17:13,599 --> 03:17:19,231
Definitely hurt him

3749
03:17:24,863 --> 03:17:25,375
Yep

3750
03:17:34,079 --> 03:17:34,847
Wow

3751
03:17:35,103 --> 03:17:36,895
This is up

3752
03:17:40,991 --> 03:17:42,783
What's going on

3753
03:17:43,295 --> 03:17:46,623
Wow I need all of you do my work for me

3754
03:17:47,903 --> 03:17:52,767
She's crazy big thing is

3755
03:17:53,023 --> 03:17:53,535
At the Prescott

3756
03:17:55,583 --> 03:18:00,703
Okay dance do you start asking your questions

3757
03:18:28,607 --> 03:18:32,959
Safely out of Austin

3758
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:34,239
Yeah he's like

3759
03:18:34,495 --> 03:18:36,799
Reporting like he's in Africa

3760
03:18:37,055 --> 03:18:38,847
And not just at a very calm

3761
03:18:39,103 --> 03:18:45,247
Prescott only intensity

3762
03:18:45,503 --> 03:18:47,807
Obviously

3763
03:18:48,063 --> 03:18:49,599
I don't think anyone

3764
03:18:49,855 --> 03:18:50,367
Cares

3765
03:18:50,623 --> 03:18:51,647
About his bulge

3766
03:18:52,159 --> 03:18:56,511
Not like we have these other pictures at infowars.com that's what he was yelling during his question

3767
03:18:57,023 --> 03:18:58,303
I don't think they care

3768
03:18:58,559 --> 03:19:04,191
Like I don't think people are looking at these pictures of you like speculating

3769
03:19:04,447 --> 03:19:05,983
They care about the tip line

3770
03:19:06,495 --> 03:19:10,591
About the actual investigation that they're carrying out and they know that

3771
03:19:10,847 --> 03:19:11,359
Like

3772
03:19:11,615 --> 03:19:15,711
If people are trying to give them tips about the CST guys

3773
03:19:16,991 --> 03:19:17,503
Amwaste

3774
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:18,527
F****** time

3775
03:19:18,783 --> 03:19:19,807
And you're not

3776
03:19:20,575 --> 03:19:24,671
A distraction but if you know who these two suspects are we need your help with that

3777
03:19:24,927 --> 03:19:26,463
We aren't we haven't identified them

3778
03:19:26,975 --> 03:19:30,303
I think that very easily taking that

3779
03:19:31,071 --> 03:19:32,095
I misrepresented as

3780
03:19:32,351 --> 03:19:34,655
The media and the FBI in the

3781
03:19:34,911 --> 03:19:37,471
The DHHS

3782
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:39,007
I don't care

3783
03:19:39,263 --> 03:19:41,823
Leave them alone about that

3784
03:19:43,871 --> 03:19:44,383
Yeah it is

3785
03:19:44,639 --> 03:19:45,151
It is one of those

3786
03:19:45,407 --> 03:19:46,175
Situations where

3787
03:19:46,687 --> 03:19:49,247
Those press conferences in all the f******

3788
03:19:49,503 --> 03:19:50,783
It's like we talked about the name

3789
03:19:51,039 --> 03:19:51,551
Fourchette

3790
03:19:51,807 --> 03:19:52,575
That the UN

3791
03:19:53,087 --> 03:19:53,599
And all that stuff

3792
03:19:53,855 --> 03:19:55,391
They need a consultant to be like

3793
03:19:55,647 --> 03:19:56,671
Here's the language

3794
03:19:56,927 --> 03:19:57,951
But if you use this

3795
03:19:58,207 --> 03:19:59,231
They're going to Twisted

3796
03:19:59,743 --> 03:20:01,791
Do you like huh here's what you want to say

3797
03:20:02,047 --> 03:20:02,559
Alright

3798
03:20:02,815 --> 03:20:04,607
The other photograph

3799
03:20:05,375 --> 03:20:08,959
Alright I understand why you would want to put it that way because I hear words

3800
03:20:09,215 --> 03:20:09,727
And they make sense

3801
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:11,775
Right but what you need to say is

3802
03:20:12,031 --> 03:20:13,055
We would like tips

3803
03:20:14,591 --> 03:20:20,735
Right Use the negative reinforcement

3804
03:20:21,759 --> 03:20:22,783
Have fun

3805
03:20:23,039 --> 03:20:26,111
With your piddly vulture

3806
03:20:26,367 --> 03:20:31,743
Dismissive and we would love that but hey

3807
03:20:31,999 --> 03:20:38,143
What are you go read articles from days ago explaining who those dudes are so suspicious

3808
03:20:38,655 --> 03:20:44,799
Always arguing to have a certain level of professionalism in

3809
03:20:45,055 --> 03:20:49,919
I understand that

3810
03:20:50,431 --> 03:20:56,575
I'm talking about maybe would be fun to see in a movie as opposed to what would function in the real world

3811
03:21:04,511 --> 03:21:05,535
Obviously.

3812
03:21:08,607 --> 03:21:11,935
I'm so proud Auntie here now it's gets into talking about how he just

3813
03:21:13,727 --> 03:21:14,239
Proof

3814
03:21:14,751 --> 03:21:16,031
Alex

3815
03:21:16,287 --> 03:21:16,799
Suggest

3816
03:21:17,055 --> 03:21:18,079
Dangerous

3817
03:21:18,591 --> 03:21:19,615
Play Novak

3818
03:21:51,359 --> 03:21:52,639
Alright

3819
03:21:53,407 --> 03:21:56,991
He's trying to get people to go to Boston to disrupt in her ass p

3820
03:21:57,759 --> 03:21:59,295
This is exactly the

3821
03:21:59,551 --> 03:22:02,111
Sort of about

3822
03:22:02,367 --> 03:22:03,135
For Sandy Hooks

3823
03:22:03,647 --> 03:22:06,463
And you see it's very clearly in his repertoire of action

3824
03:22:09,791 --> 03:22:11,583
Needs to converge on Boston in

3825
03:22:11,839 --> 03:22:12,607
Defeat the terrorists

3826
03:22:13,631 --> 03:22:15,423
Goddamn tattoo that backfiring

3827
03:22:15,679 --> 03:22:16,447
Can people taking him

3828
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:19,007
Literally and Denver down to getting wrecked

3829
03:22:19,263 --> 03:22:24,127
Never works for him

3830
03:22:24,383 --> 03:22:30,015
Alex is celebrating like a returning hero glad I hired you

3831
03:22:30,271 --> 03:22:31,551
Alex

3832
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:36,415
Obviously

3833
03:22:36,671 --> 03:22:37,439
He's probably already dead

3834
03:22:38,207 --> 03:22:39,999
They don't want the white redneck

3835
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:42,047
Executed

3836
03:22:48,191 --> 03:22:53,055
Cam

3837
03:23:01,759 --> 03:23:04,319
Oh my God

3838
03:23:04,575 --> 03:23:10,207
They didn't answer so scared of him

3839
03:23:11,231 --> 03:23:12,255
I think their disgust

3840
03:23:13,023 --> 03:23:14,047
I think it's more like

3841
03:23:14,303 --> 03:23:17,375
Yelling stupid s*** you being super disruptive

3842
03:23:17,887 --> 03:23:20,703
I don't know how you react to that in a professional manner

3843
03:23:23,263 --> 03:23:27,871
Like they're acting like he's gay

3844
03:23:28,127 --> 03:23:31,199
Ulcer feel like

3845
03:23:31,711 --> 03:23:33,247
Thickened with someone is acting

3846
03:23:35,039 --> 03:23:39,903
Everybody was engaged with the real world understands that there's a tragedy and there's people on the loose

3847
03:23:40,159 --> 03:23:42,463
That these people are working really hard

3848
03:23:42,719 --> 03:23:43,487
To try and fight

3849
03:23:44,255 --> 03:23:45,023
Now you're someone

3850
03:23:45,279 --> 03:23:46,815
Just making a show out of

3851
03:23:47,327 --> 03:23:48,351
It's disgusting

3852
03:23:48,863 --> 03:23:50,655
Interested

3853
03:23:50,911 --> 03:23:51,423
The community

3854
03:23:51,679 --> 03:23:52,447
Quite frankly

3855
03:23:52,959 --> 03:23:53,727
Dammit that's

3856
03:23:53,983 --> 03:23:55,007
That's such a

3857
03:23:55,263 --> 03:23:55,775
Good just

3858
03:23:56,031 --> 03:23:56,543
Installation of Art

3859
03:23:57,823 --> 03:23:59,871
Back to Tampa.

3860
03:24:00,127 --> 03:24:04,223
They finished talking to him and then they realize that you still on the line

3861
03:24:04,479 --> 03:24:06,015
Back to him

3862
03:24:06,271 --> 03:24:08,063
And here is where we get a cameo

3863
03:24:08,575 --> 03:24:09,343
Expect

3864
03:24:09,599 --> 03:24:10,111
Cameo

3865
03:24:10,367 --> 03:24:10,879
From someone

3866
03:24:11,391 --> 03:24:15,487
Richard Belzer

3867
03:24:19,327 --> 03:24:20,351
Hear me I can hear him

3868
03:24:36,735 --> 03:24:42,111
That was Kelly that was Elvis's what divorce

3869
03:24:42,623 --> 03:24:44,159
You can kind of hear it in her voice

3870
03:24:44,415 --> 03:24:46,463
She does not happy at all

3871
03:24:46,975 --> 03:24:50,815
I do not know what's going on and that was f***** up

3872
03:24:52,095 --> 03:24:52,607
So

3873
03:24:52,863 --> 03:24:58,239
Probably time to calm down is b*******

3874
03:24:58,495 --> 03:25:04,127
Yes so they accidentally clicked over to the wrong line so she was talking to Alex on the work phone

3875
03:25:04,383 --> 03:25:09,759
Yeah they clicked over that's the only way that could have happened

3876
03:25:10,015 --> 03:25:12,575
I don't know what does not sound happy

3877
03:25:12,831 --> 03:25:13,343
Be there

3878
03:25:13,855 --> 03:25:18,975
That's the only time I've ever heard her on the show

3879
03:25:19,231 --> 03:25:19,999
Alex's wife

3880
03:25:20,511 --> 03:25:21,535
You're on the wrong line

3881
03:25:22,303 --> 03:25:23,839
It doesn't even sound that like

3882
03:25:26,911 --> 03:25:27,423
Annoyed

3883
03:25:28,959 --> 03:25:31,007
Yeah well that's possible tone of

3884
03:25:33,311 --> 03:25:39,455
There is a ton of a bit like this means Alex put me on f****** hold

3885
03:25:39,711 --> 03:25:40,479
Doesn't feel good

3886
03:25:40,735 --> 03:25:41,759
Nope

3887
03:25:42,015 --> 03:25:44,063
Continue encouraging people to go to Boston

3888
03:25:44,831 --> 03:25:46,879
At this point

3889
03:25:47,391 --> 03:25:49,695
Very celebratory about

3890
03:25:49,951 --> 03:25:50,463
Particular thing

3891
03:25:51,231 --> 03:25:57,375
Go to Boston right now if you're listening

3892
03:25:59,423 --> 03:26:00,191
People questions

3893
03:26:05,311 --> 03:26:07,871
We broke the record

3894
03:26:16,063 --> 03:26:22,207
Ignore

3895
03:26:30,655 --> 03:26:36,799
Hey down those are civil last 14 members that are very easily explain the FBI knows who they are

3896
03:26:37,055 --> 03:26:38,847
They're not ignoring the real suspects you're

3897
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:39,871
Just full of s***

3898
03:26:43,199 --> 03:26:44,479
Alex is recognizing

3899
03:26:44,735 --> 03:26:46,271
How f****** lucrative this is

3900
03:26:47,039 --> 03:26:51,391
And what he's doing is maybe not illegal why don't we do this more

3901
03:26:52,671 --> 03:26:54,975
Crazy

3902
03:26:55,231 --> 03:26:57,279
Then he's expressing about a car traffic

3903
03:26:57,535 --> 03:26:58,815
The servers are smoke

3904
03:27:04,959 --> 03:27:06,495
Oh my God it's all happening

3905
03:27:07,007 --> 03:27:10,079
Yeah I think you should also I've also should have added in

3906
03:27:13,407 --> 03:27:14,943
She's talking to a clearly drunk

3907
03:27:15,455 --> 03:27:19,551
Alex as most likely very very likely

3908
03:27:20,575 --> 03:27:22,367
Describe this next clip itself parody

3909
03:27:22,879 --> 03:27:23,647
Because it begins

3910
03:27:24,415 --> 03:27:25,951
With David and Jacari

3911
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:27,487
Trying to express Houston

3912
03:27:28,767 --> 03:27:30,559
The interests of Infowars

3913
03:27:33,631 --> 03:27:36,191
Alex immediately invalidates

3914
03:27:36,959 --> 03:27:40,031
We are about

3915
03:27:57,695 --> 03:28:02,815
World

3916
03:28:03,071 --> 03:28:04,351
Wow

3917
03:28:13,055 --> 03:28:15,871
Down

3918
03:28:18,431 --> 03:28:24,575
David Knight says we are more interested in truth been position immediately out of artisan bread

3919
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:30,463
That's too

3920
03:28:39,423 --> 03:28:40,191
It's cheesy

3921
03:28:40,447 --> 03:28:43,775
Does Christ that's too bad

3922
03:28:44,543 --> 03:28:45,823
Go to Kohl's

3923
03:28:46,079 --> 03:28:48,383
Some listeners take

3924
03:28:48,639 --> 03:28:49,663
On what the Press

3925
03:28:49,919 --> 03:28:51,199
You know what they're feeling about it

3926
03:28:51,711 --> 03:28:53,759
And his first guy

3927
03:28:56,319 --> 03:28:58,367
And also wanted to say that you know

3928
03:28:58,623 --> 03:29:04,255
Play the song news conference was about one thing it wasn't

3929
03:29:04,511 --> 03:29:10,655
This was a direct shot at Alex Jones Infowars

3930
03:29:10,911 --> 03:29:17,055
Mention Infowars daily shot him down

3931
03:29:17,311 --> 03:29:20,127
Any other photos why because yesterday

3932
03:29:20,383 --> 03:29:24,991
Everything else had out about the photos of the field xcetera

3933
03:29:25,247 --> 03:29:28,319
I really believe that's the main reason they put this out

3934
03:29:28,575 --> 03:29:33,951
Yeah this whole press conference really wasn't about getting the suspects photos

3935
03:29:35,743 --> 03:29:37,791
This is parasitic levels of Narcissus

3936
03:29:38,559 --> 03:29:39,327
Like it's crazy

3937
03:29:39,583 --> 03:29:43,423
These people are narcissistic

3938
03:29:43,679 --> 03:29:49,823
Imagining that this entire city all the FBI

3939
03:29:54,943 --> 03:29:58,015
That is such a way to inflate your own

3940
03:29:59,295 --> 03:30:00,319
Turn Your Wagon to somebody

3941
03:30:02,111 --> 03:30:02,879
Like that stuff

3942
03:30:03,391 --> 03:30:04,927
Narcissism by proxy

3943
03:30:06,719 --> 03:30:07,999
Stupid ass

3944
03:30:10,303 --> 03:30:11,327
BFDI

3945
03:30:19,007 --> 03:30:19,775
What are you doing

3946
03:30:20,031 --> 03:30:24,383
I try to kill me that my eyes

3947
03:30:39,231 --> 03:30:44,351
We can solve this is that control the narrative somebody lock that man inside his house and

3948
03:30:44,863 --> 03:30:46,911
He probably doesn't get out that much

3949
03:30:47,423 --> 03:30:48,703
Alex

3950
03:30:48,959 --> 03:30:49,471
Barges into

3951
03:30:49,727 --> 03:30:50,239
Studio

3952
03:30:50,751 --> 03:30:51,263
Because

3953
03:30:51,519 --> 03:30:55,359
He is going to try and Bully Lee Ann McAdoo into coming on air

3954
03:30:55,615 --> 03:30:56,383
Because Leanne

3955
03:30:56,895 --> 03:30:58,175
Has Crack the Case

3956
03:30:58,431 --> 03:30:59,967
And figure it out why

3957
03:31:00,223 --> 03:31:00,991
These two

3958
03:31:01,247 --> 03:31:02,783
The photos of the suspect

3959
03:31:03,295 --> 03:31:04,575
Can't be the real suspect

3960
03:31:05,343 --> 03:31:05,855
She's

3961
03:31:06,111 --> 03:31:08,159
The Kaylee and Scott

3962
03:31:08,415 --> 03:31:11,231
Alright

3963
03:31:25,311 --> 03:31:26,847
Gray black backpack

3964
03:31:28,639 --> 03:31:29,151
I mean

3965
03:31:29,663 --> 03:31:30,943
Did she get a round of applause

3966
03:31:56,543 --> 03:32:01,407
Briefly do

3967
03:32:07,039 --> 03:32:08,319
Now-you-see-it-now-you-don't

3968
03:32:08,575 --> 03:32:13,183
This is

3969
03:32:13,439 --> 03:32:14,463
Welcome aboard

3970
03:32:15,231 --> 03:32:21,375
Here is only one picture that was made public of an exploded

3971
03:32:21,887 --> 03:32:24,447
Darker most likely Black Backpack

3972
03:32:24,959 --> 03:32:30,591
When the FBI released images of the suspects who we would soon come to Noah's tamerlan and dzhokhar Tsarnaev

3973
03:32:30,847 --> 03:32:33,919
Appeared

3974
03:32:36,479 --> 03:32:37,247
Possibly Gray

3975
03:32:37,759 --> 03:32:43,647
At no point it's been established

3976
03:32:44,159 --> 03:32:47,487
Outdoor hit list of the brothers were carrying identical bags

3977
03:32:47,999 --> 03:32:50,815
This Photograph back easily have been 21 tamerlan

3978
03:32:51,071 --> 03:32:54,143
Miscarrying

3979
03:32:54,399 --> 03:32:55,423
There's literally no contract

3980
03:32:56,447 --> 03:33:00,543
But because in Forza so insisted on coming up coming out with

3981
03:33:03,615 --> 03:33:06,431
Anything can be used to plant doubt

3982
03:33:06,687 --> 03:33:07,455
What is worth report

3983
03:33:08,223 --> 03:33:09,503
Beyond that one

3984
03:33:09,759 --> 03:33:13,855
Still photograph of a post-explosion backpack is an odd enough to conduct a forensic

3985
03:33:14,111 --> 03:33:14,623
Investigation

3986
03:33:15,647 --> 03:33:20,511
Alex's crew have no idea what effect the explosion could have had on the color of the backpack

3987
03:33:21,279 --> 03:33:23,327
Definitely think

3988
03:33:23,583 --> 03:33:25,375
Could've turned a grey backpack

3989
03:33:25,631 --> 03:33:26,143
Black

3990
03:33:26,399 --> 03:33:28,703
Justice

3991
03:33:29,215 --> 03:33:30,751
This isn't the behavior journalist

3992
03:33:31,263 --> 03:33:32,031
This is more what you do

3993
03:33:32,287 --> 03:33:32,799
Expect to hear from

3994
03:33:33,055 --> 03:33:35,359
Idiot smoking weed

3995
03:33:36,127 --> 03:33:38,175
Tregen if you're okay

3996
03:33:38,431 --> 03:33:40,735
Slightly impaired but utterly without Subs

3997
03:33:42,015 --> 03:33:43,807
Poor firstshowing Leanne

3998
03:33:44,063 --> 03:33:50,207
Really sucks that your first appearance on the show was starting half-cooked bulshit to help Alex profit off of lying about a national trash

3999
03:33:51,231 --> 03:33:53,023
Unlike these other people in the show

4000
03:33:53,279 --> 03:33:55,839
I know what LeeAnn was doing before she joined infowar

4001
03:33:56,607 --> 03:33:58,143
I'm certain that this is just a

4002
03:33:58,399 --> 03:33:58,911
Gig for her

4003
03:33:59,423 --> 03:34:01,215
I know that used to be a new-age hippie

4004
03:34:01,471 --> 03:34:05,055
Connect with source

4005
03:34:05,567 --> 03:34:07,871
Is the Mayan calendar ended in 2012

4006
03:34:08,127 --> 03:34:11,711
Which is shockingly close to when she won Alex's find a reporter contacts

4007
03:34:12,223 --> 03:34:15,039
I know that she'd entered another TV host in contest

4008
03:34:15,295 --> 03:34:17,855
The CW Austin star in 2011

4009
03:34:18,111 --> 03:34:21,183
And she been on a TV show prior to that called The Last Resort

4010
03:34:21,951 --> 03:34:25,535
I'm willing to believe that you may not have known what you was getting into when she started it

4011
03:34:25,791 --> 03:34:27,583
4 worst but if you're a Bohemian free

4012
03:34:27,839 --> 03:34:28,863
Free spirit out there practicing

4013
03:34:29,119 --> 03:34:29,887
Sentara one day

4014
03:34:30,911 --> 03:34:35,519
And not immediately when you see Alex behaving

4015
03:34:35,775 --> 03:34:37,055
Hornier since the bombing

4016
03:34:37,567 --> 03:34:40,639
I guess all I can say is I fucken hope that job paid super well

4017
03:34:41,151 --> 03:34:41,919
Because you're doing this

4018
03:34:42,431 --> 03:34:43,967
And you are you don't believe this

4019
03:34:45,247 --> 03:34:46,015
This is an act

4020
03:34:47,551 --> 03:34:48,319
I feel bad

4021
03:34:48,575 --> 03:34:49,855
I feel bad.

4022
03:34:50,111 --> 03:34:51,647
Maybe not for her later

4023
03:34:51,903 --> 03:34:53,183
Tear

4024
03:34:53,439 --> 03:34:56,255
On April 23rd

4025
03:34:57,791 --> 03:35:03,935
I mean I have for you by like

4026
03:35:05,471 --> 03:35:08,543
And I know that Alex is forcing her on Aaron she'd rather not

4027
03:35:09,055 --> 03:35:09,567
B

4028
03:35:10,079 --> 03:35:11,103
Still go f*** yourself

4029
03:35:11,359 --> 03:35:13,919
Yeah I remember my family had a blue minivan

4030
03:35:15,199 --> 03:35:15,711
And then we left

4031
03:35:16,479 --> 03:35:17,247
We came back there was

4032
03:35:19,039 --> 03:35:19,551
Just pile of

4033
03:35:20,063 --> 03:35:22,879
And so we assume that the minivan

4034
03:35:23,135 --> 03:35:23,647
Install

4035
03:35:24,159 --> 03:35:24,671
The definitely was

4036
03:35:25,183 --> 03:35:25,951
Inspire make sense

4037
03:35:26,975 --> 03:35:28,767
Because our minivan with blue

4038
03:35:29,279 --> 03:35:32,351
It was a blue minivan it was it a gray one made of Ash

4039
03:35:32,607 --> 03:35:33,631
Right

4040
03:35:33,887 --> 03:35:34,655
It makes sense

4041
03:35:35,679 --> 03:35:37,983
And I would feel just as bad about

4042
03:35:38,239 --> 03:35:39,519
Or mad

4043
03:35:39,775 --> 03:35:41,055
And directed this way

4044
03:35:42,079 --> 03:35:47,967
Like any of these people if I knew like let's say if I knew that right before Rob do

4045
03:35:48,223 --> 03:35:49,503
Joined Infowars

4046
03:35:50,015 --> 03:35:52,319
He was out there writing about Crystal

4047
03:35:52,575 --> 03:35:55,391
A left-wing active

4048
03:35:55,647 --> 03:35:58,463
Something like that

4049
03:35:58,719 --> 03:35:59,231
These people

4050
03:35:59,487 --> 03:36:00,255
Pryor live

4051
03:36:01,791 --> 03:36:03,583
Insisted like you are acting

4052
03:36:03,839 --> 03:36:04,863
You're doing this

4053
03:36:05,119 --> 03:36:06,911
You're doing

4054
03:36:07,167 --> 03:36:09,215
And spreading this property

4055
03:36:09,983 --> 03:36:11,263
I'm not sure which is worse

4056
03:36:11,519 --> 03:36:14,335
You know like actually believing it or doing it for a check

4057
03:36:15,871 --> 03:36:18,175
I think doing it for a check is less

4058
03:36:20,223 --> 03:36:20,735
Acceptable to me

4059
03:36:21,247 --> 03:36:22,015
Yeah yeah

4060
03:36:22,271 --> 03:36:25,599
Krystal's in Terre Haute

4061
03:36:26,111 --> 03:36:27,391
Not doing it for a check

4062
03:36:28,927 --> 03:36:29,439
That's no good

4063
03:36:30,207 --> 03:36:30,719
I don't know

4064
03:36:31,231 --> 03:36:31,743
I'm just

4065
03:36:33,535 --> 03:36:34,047
Absolutely

4066
03:36:40,703 --> 03:36:41,727
Studio

4067
03:36:42,751 --> 03:36:44,543
He was trying to spend

4068
03:36:44,799 --> 03:36:46,847
Conspiracy

4069
03:36:47,359 --> 03:36:47,871
Certainly

4070
03:36:48,127 --> 03:36:50,431
And so they get back to him and he's still trying

4071
03:36:50,687 --> 03:36:51,711
To spend this conspiracy

4072
03:36:52,223 --> 03:36:52,735
Address.

4073
03:36:54,015 --> 03:36:55,039
Thought you'd like to know that

4074
03:36:55,295 --> 03:36:56,319
I'm sorry could you

4075
03:37:10,143 --> 03:37:12,703
This is bulshit

4076
03:37:13,215 --> 03:37:18,847
Text unreal or whatever

4077
03:37:22,687 --> 03:37:23,967
What is a Coach Dave show

4078
03:37:24,479 --> 03:37:25,759
So Alex is full of this

4079
03:37:26,015 --> 03:37:27,039
This narcissism

4080
03:37:29,087 --> 03:37:29,599
About all of these

4081
03:37:30,623 --> 03:37:31,391
Cscope to Media

4082
03:37:31,647 --> 03:37:34,719
He thinks that even the release of the FBI pictures of

4083
03:37:34,975 --> 03:37:35,487
Vivica Fox

4084
03:37:35,999 --> 03:37:37,279
Our evidence

4085
03:37:37,535 --> 03:37:38,303
He's

4086
03:37:40,351 --> 03:37:42,143
He's being profited handsomely for it

4087
03:37:44,959 --> 03:37:45,727
Way more attention

4088
03:37:46,751 --> 03:37:48,287
And that's probably bad

4089
03:37:49,823 --> 03:37:53,919
On the night of April 18th tamerlan and dzhokhar Tsarnaev realize that they had been

4090
03:37:54,687 --> 03:37:56,479
As soon as the FBI release pictures of them

4091
03:37:56,735 --> 03:37:57,247
Yeah that's

4092
03:38:01,343 --> 03:38:04,415
They weren't getting any suspicion thrown their way online

4093
03:38:04,671 --> 03:38:06,975
From all of these blogs we're researching in

4094
03:38:07,231 --> 03:38:08,255
Finding suspect

4095
03:38:08,767 --> 03:38:11,327
The authorities have been tight-lipped about the leaves they were pursuing

4096
03:38:11,583 --> 03:38:13,375
If you were that cute might get the sense

4097
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:14,399
You gotten away with it

4098
03:38:16,703 --> 03:38:17,727
That's pretty much what they thought

4099
03:38:17,983 --> 03:38:19,519
They gone back to their normal lives

4100
03:38:20,799 --> 03:38:22,591
Thought maybe we pulled this off

4101
03:38:24,127 --> 03:38:24,639
And then

4102
03:38:24,895 --> 03:38:26,175
That press conference happened

4103
03:38:26,431 --> 03:38:27,455
It all got disrupted

4104
03:38:27,711 --> 03:38:28,223
And they pant

4105
03:38:29,759 --> 03:38:31,807
The FBI press conference was at about 5

4106
03:38:32,575 --> 03:38:36,927
And at 10:31 p.m. the brothers approached the vehicle of an MIT police officer

4107
03:38:37,439 --> 03:38:38,207
Sean Collier

4108
03:38:38,463 --> 03:38:38,975
Do they vent

4109
03:38:39,743 --> 03:38:41,791
Most likely because they only had one gun

4110
03:38:42,047 --> 03:38:42,559
And there were two of them

4111
03:38:43,327 --> 03:38:46,399
2016 SUV in

4112
03:38:47,167 --> 03:38:48,703
The driver of that car managed to escape

4113
03:38:48,959 --> 03:38:51,007
Called 911 at 12:19 a.m.

4114
03:38:52,031 --> 03:38:56,639
He goes on to tell the police that the two men carjacked in Marathon

4115
03:38:56,895 --> 03:38:58,175
And that his car was equipped

4116
03:38:58,687 --> 03:38:59,199
GPS

4117
03:38:59,455 --> 03:39:00,991
So the police turned up the GPS

4118
03:39:01,503 --> 03:39:02,015
I began to track

4119
03:39:03,295 --> 03:39:06,367
1241 the police located the SUV in water

4120
03:39:07,391 --> 03:39:08,415
Along with the Sudan

4121
03:39:08,927 --> 03:39:10,719
I was being driven by the two brothers

4122
03:39:10,975 --> 03:39:11,743
And it's called a

4123
03:39:12,255 --> 03:39:16,607
The reporting officer is told not to approach until more units arrived so he follows

4124
03:39:17,375 --> 03:39:19,935
After a brief Drive the driver of the SUV gets out

4125
03:39:20,191 --> 03:39:21,983
And approaches the police car fire in a guy

4126
03:39:22,751 --> 03:39:26,079
At approximately the same time the police supervisors

4127
03:39:26,335 --> 03:39:26,847
And someone else

4128
03:39:27,103 --> 03:39:29,151
Comes out of the sedan

4129
03:39:30,431 --> 03:39:31,711
There's a brief firefight

4130
03:39:31,967 --> 03:39:35,295
And it's 12:49 p.m. the man with a gun who turns out to be Timberline

4131
03:39:35,807 --> 03:39:39,391
Is tackled by a cop run over by his younger brother

4132
03:39:39,647 --> 03:39:40,159
Who's attempting

4133
03:39:41,439 --> 03:39:43,743
Timberlands put in an ambulance and taken to the hospital

4134
03:39:43,999 --> 03:39:46,303
Where he was pronounced dead at 1:06 a.m.

4135
03:39:46,559 --> 03:39:47,071
Despite attempts at

4136
03:39:47,327 --> 03:39:47,839
Resuscitation

4137
03:39:48,351 --> 03:39:49,631
The Joker got away

4138
03:39:50,143 --> 03:39:52,191
He'll be about a half-mile away

4139
03:39:52,447 --> 03:39:53,215
Inflight on foot

4140
03:39:53,983 --> 03:39:55,263
Tonight was absolute chaos

4141
03:39:55,775 --> 03:40:01,407
I was all set and done one suspect was dead along with Sean Collier the MIT officer

4142
03:40:02,431 --> 03:40:02,943
Additionally

4143
03:40:03,199 --> 03:40:04,223
Officer Dennis.

4144
03:40:04,479 --> 03:40:04,991
DJ Simmons

4145
03:40:05,247 --> 03:40:07,551
Suffered injuries in the Watertown firefight

4146
03:40:07,807 --> 03:40:09,855
They were going to take his life for your later in April

4147
03:40:10,111 --> 03:40:10,879
April 2014

4148
03:40:11,391 --> 03:40:12,671
He's officially recognized as

4149
03:40:12,927 --> 03:40:13,951
The fifth victim of the bombing

4150
03:40:14,463 --> 03:40:18,303
Boston remembers him as a hero he's all too often forgotten in the story

4151
03:40:19,071 --> 03:40:23,423
In particular was pretty upset Wahlberg movie Patriot

4152
03:40:25,983 --> 03:40:29,055
Even though there is a memorial Loop of the other victims of that attack

4153
03:40:29,567 --> 03:40:30,079
In the movie

4154
03:40:30,335 --> 03:40:31,871
It's hard not to see that being erased

4155
03:40:32,127 --> 03:40:34,431
Might also be partially because it's a Mark Wahlberg

4156
03:40:35,967 --> 03:40:37,759
The entire situation changed overnight

4157
03:40:38,271 --> 03:40:41,599
Now the surviving perpetrator knows with the police know who he is

4158
03:40:42,111 --> 03:40:42,879
Better looking

4159
03:40:43,647 --> 03:40:46,975
But he doesn't know if his brother is dead or if he's being interrogated

4160
03:40:48,511 --> 03:40:51,327
Now the police know that these suspects are absolutely willing to

4161
03:40:51,583 --> 03:40:52,095
The murder police

4162
03:40:52,607 --> 03:40:54,143
And one of them is on the loose and armed

4163
03:40:54,399 --> 03:40:57,215
At least it possibly would even more IDs

4164
03:40:58,239 --> 03:40:59,007
The city

4165
03:40:59,263 --> 03:41:01,567
Previously on edge with an absence of information

4166
03:41:02,079 --> 03:41:03,103
Now it's come to the crest

4167
03:41:03,615 --> 03:41:05,663
Confined itself with a whole lot of information

4168
03:41:06,431 --> 03:41:07,711
And it's f****** scary information

4169
03:41:08,479 --> 03:41:10,271
No one knows where show car

4170
03:41:11,551 --> 03:41:12,831
How does Alex respond to all

4171
03:41:14,111 --> 03:41:15,647
That's will learn on our next

4172
03:41:15,903 --> 03:41:18,719
Where we'll also get to learn a little bit more

4173
03:41:20,255 --> 03:41:21,791
It's going to be a gigantic

4174
03:41:23,583 --> 03:41:24,095
Alex

4175
03:41:27,167 --> 03:41:29,215
I can't even imagine what he's going to end up doing with

4176
03:41:29,727 --> 03:41:30,495
Really not looking for

4177
03:41:31,007 --> 03:41:32,799
If he's gone this crazy

4178
03:41:33,311 --> 03:41:35,615
With the situation we've had so far

4179
03:41:36,383 --> 03:41:37,151
Blenders

4180
03:41:37,407 --> 03:41:38,687
Firefight

4181
03:41:39,455 --> 03:41:39,967
I killed cop

4182
03:41:40,991 --> 03:41:42,015
One of the suspects

4183
03:41:42,271 --> 03:41:42,783
Is Dad

4184
03:41:43,295 --> 03:41:46,111
Overnight I just can't even imagine how you respond

4185
03:41:46,367 --> 03:41:46,879
Possible the 19th

4186
03:41:47,647 --> 03:41:48,159
Now this is going to

4187
03:41:49,183 --> 03:41:51,999
Yep so look forward to that

4188
03:41:54,047 --> 03:41:54,559
God

4189
03:41:54,815 --> 03:41:56,351
You know what it's just like

4190
03:41:56,863 --> 03:41:57,375
You just think

4191
03:41:57,887 --> 03:41:59,935
That's going to be the most

4192
03:42:00,191 --> 03:42:02,751
Yeah.

4193
03:42:03,007 --> 03:42:04,287
Is just new levels of

4194
03:42:04,543 --> 03:42:05,311
Terrible Behavior

4195
03:42:05,823 --> 03:42:06,847
On his Park

4196
03:42:07,103 --> 03:42:07,871
It's

4197
03:42:09,919 --> 03:42:10,431
It's a it's a

4198
03:42:10,687 --> 03:42:12,735
Spiral down the toilet bowl

4199
03:42:12,991 --> 03:42:14,015
Sanity that says

4200
03:42:18,111 --> 03:42:18,879
Even without

4201
03:42:19,647 --> 03:42:20,415
Even without records

4202
03:42:20,927 --> 03:42:22,463
Cuz obviously it's easy to look back

4203
03:42:24,767 --> 03:42:25,279
But even if

4204
03:42:25,535 --> 03:42:26,303
Even

4205
03:42:27,839 --> 03:42:28,863
It is unconscionable

4206
03:42:29,887 --> 03:42:30,399
What is.

4207
03:42:30,655 --> 03:42:31,423
Yeah it is

4208
03:42:33,727 --> 03:42:34,239
How many

4209
03:42:34,495 --> 03:42:35,007
People flock

4210
03:42:37,311 --> 03:42:37,823
Simple

4211
03:42:38,847 --> 03:42:39,871
From the dumbest

4212
03:42:41,407 --> 03:42:42,943
In order to assuage their

4213
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:43,711
Dumb fear

4214
03:42:44,479 --> 03:42:45,247
Are there

4215
03:42:47,551 --> 03:42:48,063
Is Whatley

4216
03:42:48,575 --> 03:42:49,855
Tubidy

4217
03:42:51,903 --> 03:42:52,415
Just like that

4218
03:42:52,671 --> 03:42:53,439
F****** micro

4219
03:42:55,487 --> 03:43:00,607
Probably because it's a more interesting story

4220
03:43:00,863 --> 03:43:04,703
Al profit

4221
03:43:04,959 --> 03:43:06,239
Alex and his operation

4222
03:43:06,495 --> 03:43:10,079
It's really tragic to think about and

4223
03:43:11,871 --> 03:43:12,383
Please

4224
03:43:13,407 --> 03:43:14,687
You can extrapolate the end of

4225
03:43:15,711 --> 03:43:17,247
Like you see exactly how we're going

4226
03:43:18,271 --> 03:43:21,855
Pretend

4227
03:43:22,111 --> 03:43:23,135
Soon but

4228
03:43:23,391 --> 03:43:29,535
That is exactly how we're all going to die at all really helps make sense of his later to decorate

4229
03:43:32,351 --> 03:43:33,887
His desperation to be

4230
03:43:34,143 --> 03:43:34,655
Piscinas en

4231
03:43:34,911 --> 03:43:36,703
On the right side the winning team

4232
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:39,007
Star appearances of destroying

4233
03:43:40,543 --> 03:43:43,103
It kind of perspective a lot of like

4234
03:43:45,919 --> 03:43:47,967
Yeah I noticed that but like

4235
03:43:49,503 --> 03:43:50,271
This is him

4236
03:43:51,295 --> 03:43:53,087
Almost making that turn of like

4237
03:43:53,855 --> 03:43:54,367
Finally

4238
03:43:54,623 --> 03:43:55,647
I'm actually right

4239
03:43:56,671 --> 03:44:01,023
Like this is that is like that consistent that insistence that they are not giving me

4240
03:44:01,279 --> 03:44:02,303
Credit for being right

4241
03:44:02,559 --> 03:44:03,583
That belief

4242
03:44:03,839 --> 03:44:05,119
Holyshit

4243
03:44:07,679 --> 03:44:11,519
Finally the pieces are in place for me to present myself as right

4244
03:44:12,543 --> 03:44:13,311
Well I mean

4245
03:44:13,567 --> 03:44:15,615
In that day I really do think he believes

4246
03:44:16,639 --> 03:44:17,663
I think it's

4247
03:44:17,919 --> 03:44:19,711
Possible I think it's an argument you can make

4248
03:44:19,967 --> 03:44:21,503
I'm Lessard

4249
03:44:21,759 --> 03:44:22,527
As someone who

4250
03:44:23,039 --> 03:44:27,647
Doesn't trust him at all

4251
03:44:30,719 --> 03:44:31,231
Spiders nest

4252
03:44:32,767 --> 03:44:33,791
Scary things

4253
03:44:34,047 --> 03:44:37,119
It's mysterious

4254
03:44:37,375 --> 03:44:39,167
You don't like Cormac McCarthy wrote

4255
03:44:39,935 --> 03:44:40,959
Alex Jones brain

4256
03:44:41,215 --> 03:44:42,495
It is something that is

4257
03:44:43,775 --> 03:44:44,799
It's hard to decipher

4258
03:44:45,311 --> 03:44:49,663
You know you don't really eat you think you understand what's going on but it may be something entirely different

4259
03:44:50,175 --> 03:44:53,247
I'm ready sent to say that he actually believes

4260
03:44:55,039 --> 03:44:59,135
If he wasn't getting a ton of traffic off this I think you could make that argument much

4261
03:44:59,391 --> 03:45:05,535
Celebrating all this traffic and recognizing like

4262
03:45:05,791 --> 03:45:08,863
That really makes it difficult for me to believe

4263
03:45:10,399 --> 03:45:11,167

Or it could just be a sub,

4271
03:45:33,695 --> 03:45:34,207
For the devil

4272
03:45:37,535 --> 03:45:39,071
Maybe anyway
