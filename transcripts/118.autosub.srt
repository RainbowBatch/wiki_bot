1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
Alex

00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:05,888
In color

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:20,224
Doesn't talk a little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,624
What is the novelty beverage address it up top is Bell's Two Hearted Ale

5
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416

00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952

00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
The chatroom be like

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,632
Talking stick to the rules as it's become a thing where there's like chance that get going of like

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
What's the beverage

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,496
I don't want

11
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,200
The hook is a 1993 song by John popper is rock and roll

12
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
I know what I was doing you know nothing about him and our fun welcome back

13
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,096
Welcome back everyone listening

14
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Thrilled to be here I've been chomping at the bit

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
You you've been texting me like a giddy schoolgirl for the past couple of days just like

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
That wasn't so much that I almost had a panic attack listening to Alex yesterday

17
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
She said he was getting into and how much I wanted to talk about it you were busy last night we couldn't do it actually

18
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm thrilled that you couldn't do it as it turns out because having the context of today

19
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,328
To yesterday show makes the narrative so much more robots

20
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
So we are at

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
Another one in the

22
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
Apologies to Jordan you're right circumstance

23
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
If anything

24
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
But

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Oh my God I am going to put a check in the column out of 8 people I'd like to say thank you.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,696
What's going on out there I can graduation song

27
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
Thank you so much appreciate it so very much

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
You have to

29
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
DS2 off board a little money also another

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,224
He is a foreign policy wonk but I unfortunately forgot to load up that sound effect

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Dammit

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
The only foreign policy wonk

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Will be getting the salutation of a technocrat

34
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
Someone's someone

35
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Sodomites

36
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Has a Caribbean

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,432
Fair enough Jordan

38
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
Good Times

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
If you would like to become a few would like to become a policy wonk and Trigger sound effects like that

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
You may do so by going to our website knowledge feit.com and couldn't support the show

41
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
We really appreciated a little update

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,936
We had set out that we needed to try and bump up a donation

43
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
$200 by the end of the month

44
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Starting on January 1st

45
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,920
And we are definitely on track to do that and I really appreciate everyone

46
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
Keep rolling a weekend hit this goal

47
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
And it's only January

48
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
11th Avenue recording guide

49
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Ahead of crack

50
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Welfare

51
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,328
A little bit ahead of track so it really really appreciate it

52
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
A big difference

53
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
If we hit our goal we will start breaking down

54
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Endgame

55
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
Alex Jones's dogs

56
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
12 and a half hour long episode

57
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
It will be

58
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,224
Devastating

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
A couple of things I've read like

60
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,160
QuickBooks 50 me covered 10 minutes

61
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,000
Now I don't want to reach the goal because I want all of that work to aventurine

62
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
That'll be very cruel

63
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
So you don't have to listen

64
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
The show if you don't like it

65
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,311
I just donated a little bit more so we can all hear those

66
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
That's what it is

67
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
We will be going over today event

68
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
The transpired on the January 10th and January 11th

69
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
2018 episode of The Alex Jones Show

70
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
But

71
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,023
What we're really going to be going over cuz I'm going to skip a lot of the bulshit like on the 11th

72
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
Joe Arpaio was on the screen for half an hour about how you the monster

73
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
Headphones

74
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
But he's on cuz he's running for congress

75
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,951
Project Veritas

76
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,279
Chiefs game on because they had an undercover investigation of Twitter

77
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
I know Twitter Shadow Banning conservatives

78
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
And so they played the video and it's the softest

79
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
You should have ever seen in my life

80
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,079
It's very clear from the context of these interviews that they have that they're secretly recording

81
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Like there's just a guy who's a

82
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
Explaining what shadowbanning is that they forgot to cut out the guy

83
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
I don't know if Twitter even does that anymore

84
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,927
And there's another one

85
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
Tracy because of course he had to say that

86
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,047
He can't get you

87
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
Tell him that

88
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,703
You should have cut that out

89
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,287
He's crafty

90
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
It's terrible

91
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
I don't know

92
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,063
It's going on on the episodes we're not going to talk about that because we need to talk about a more robust

93
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Issue

94
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Is being

95
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
Expose I

96
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Think pretty clearly

97
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
And that is what Alex Jones has

98
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
What I would officially call his lofted

99
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,423
Not have a Caribbean black accents

100
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,543
Direction

101
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Spell races Transformers

102
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
So here's the deal Alex

103
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,807
This is the point where Alex

104
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Has lost his mind

105
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
But I think he's lost his mind at a very specific Alex Jones away

106
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
He's become

107
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,279
Reasonable no no

108
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
Geez renounce

109
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,655
All of his previous statements and he's decided that now

110
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
Is the time

111
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
To open up

112
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Small independent books

113
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
No

114
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Although he'll be interested in being angry at book store where no one reads anything

115
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,063
Covers

116
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Book jacket

117
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
Every spine those books

118
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
What I mean by this I believe that

119
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,607
Defining characteristics of Alex Jones

120
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
Is jealousy and pettiness

121
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
And bitterness

122
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
I think

123
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Is it Alex

124
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Have become

125
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,663
Aware of the conspiracy World outside of himself

126
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Okay and you starting to lose his mind

127
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
Alright because he's being out.

128
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,183
Okay and I know this will flush out as we go along but my first piece of evidence

129
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Interpret

130
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
That will inform the rest of this episode

131
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
I have to take you back

132
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
2017

133
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
I have to take you back

134
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
Do a special report

135
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Did Alex Jones recorded

136
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
On Christmas Eve

137
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
But I somehow missed in the shuffle

138
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
Because I don't watch all of his special report

139
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Okay

140
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Insinuate

141
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
But he's recording this at 3 in the morning

142
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
I'm guessing that's not true

143
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
It's unclear cuz he says

144
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,255
Did Rob do is there he's the kind of guy who can call it 3 in the morning I will come down to the studio

145
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
He might have just been saying that is a general thing

146
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
Watch

147
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
So it isn't that you know

148
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,799
His wife are they an hour earlier than Central

149
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
10 hour Earth Mountain

150
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Yeah

151
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,943
Clarify for

152
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
He says that his wife is there with him like she's waiting outside Rob dude wife and kid are there

153
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
This why are you

154
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Depressant

155
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Christmas at

156
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,095
Alex Jones is a shity version of Ebenezer Scrooge

157
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,679
It's very depressing the first clip

158
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Decided to

159
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
To come into the studio

160
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
On Christmas Eve to record a special

161
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Library

162
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
It's Christmas Eve

163
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Emergency

164
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
If this doesn't

165
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Greece

166
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Emergency alert

167
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Alright

168
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Really

169
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Now

170
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
I have

171
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Anonymous

172
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
And a lot of what

173
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
The sources are in

174
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
If he gives

175
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,343
If you give those three examples like I got it for my White House sources

176
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,439
The FBI's phone

177
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Can over the internet

178
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Already have known

179
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,031
For everyone who doesn't know I don't know a bunch of looking into this and it's not really worth too much of a

180
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
Discussion but qanon is another one of these account

181
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Videos posting

182
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
Cryptic messages and stuff like that trying to get people to think

183
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,343
That they have inside information

184
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
What are some of the accounts that have existed on Reddit and unfortunate over the years that have been like

185
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,815
Men like all these people who do just play around as if they have

186
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Insider

187
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
I'm so this is Chris

188
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
This is another one

189
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
I am so

190
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
What's going on here

191
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
Is Alex

192
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Is Vic

193
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
King of conspiracy

194
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Right

195
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Historically

196
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
Turn on the radio

197
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
And he is the king of conspiracy

198
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
Most

199
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
I would say the most popular

200
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
Conspiracy theorist use the Walmart of conspiracy theories

201
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,767
For the last couple months

202
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,327
You've been pitching this narrative where this guy named Zach

203
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Comes on

204
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Over the phone

205
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,471
What is an FBI intelligence agency

206
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
Feeding him information like they were shooting from helicopters

207
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,895
I've lost Vegas shooting shirt like that

208
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Qanon

209
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Is okay

210
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,551
To the point where Rob do has interviewed people who moderate

211
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
The subreddit

212
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
XO Alex

213
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
God dammit

214
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Are you shiting me

215
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
I get to f*** with Alex

216
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
Jones directly

217
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
Yes 100% interview

218
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Alex cannot handle

219
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
The fact that you being outdone by random people f****** around on Facebook

220
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Fortune

221
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
So it took point where even

222
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,295
F****** Jerome corsi is basically writing a book

223
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Online decoding qanon message

224
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,951
I love it I love it I love it

225
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,047
Here is here's the clip where I think would really demonstrate

226
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
His true feelings

227
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
About that about that

228
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
The situation

229
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
Some little comment

230
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Qanon

231
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
That's great

232
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
This guy's known to us who he is

233
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
Say by the Bell

234
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Stop exposed

235
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Torres

236
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
He's saying the qanon isn't real but

237
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
This can be so mad in The Last Jedi whatever

238
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,159
Yoda says to Luke that

239
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Fate of the teachers for

240
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
For there

241
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
My students to out

242
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Right

243
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
I guess

244
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
Make as many Star Wars The Last Jedi reference

245
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
How would it go

246
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,479
So in this in this next court again for Christmas Eve

247
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,807
$300 will do a breakdown of The Last Jedi

248
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,463
In this next clip Alex Jones in trying to get authenticity papers for him

249
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
His hope

250
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
His intelligence fake guy

251
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
What do you need

252
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,007
What he's accidentally doesn't equip is very clearly out who this guy is

253
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
If he's real

254
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
One of those

255
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Florida

256
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
Nationality

257
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
But also a defining characteristic

258
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
He is now

259
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
We're so serious

260
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Morocco

261
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Keto not with Nick

262
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
Urgent

263
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Casablanca

264
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
I have

265
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Very very

266
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
They haven't

267
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
What's Ocean View

268
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Protect

269
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
What does que

270
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
We say who they are

271
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Bella Notte

272
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
There wasn't

273
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
Because you have made a bunch of defining characteristics

274
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
It is at the Aspen

275
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,711
Attitude is Clapper and Brennan together with Wolf Blitzer

276
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,063
I found this clip actually I found it on Alex Jones Channel

277
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
I found

278
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,463
Keep saying I found a video that he put out himself called former CIA director

279
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Calls for coup against Trump

280
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,607
Let's listen to what Alex plays of the

281
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Is where the work of

282
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Another special counsel

283
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Apps

284
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
We both work with him for a long time when he was

285
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Spire choice

286
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
Who is a straight shooter and will not be intimidated

287
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
I really hope

288
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Stop making apology

289
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Jesus chooses

290
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
LeBlanc

291
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Open you say enough is enough

292
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Aspire

293
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Presence

294
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
But if he's fired

295
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
What would you want

296
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
Paul Ryan to hang

297
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
It's the obligation

298
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Some of these orders

299
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Again

300
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
With what sodas

301
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Companies all about

302
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Butter

303
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
This is not going to

304
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Partisan issue

305
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
That's Republic

306
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Democrats are going to see

307
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,463
So that was Alex plays on this former CIA director calls for a coup against Trump

308
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,839
There's nothing there's nothing there

309
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,191
Technically does not break the law however

310
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
Completely destroys any pot

311
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,127
Possibility of believing that he is colluding

312
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,199
Person investigating him for his

313
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,551
Can of Justice then it's a good idea for Congress to

314
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,903
Overthrow the government

315
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,767
So you see what's going on

316
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Qanon

317
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
And Zack

318
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
These guys

319
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
I had said that there was a plot to overthrow Trump

320
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,543
In November which is indicated by The Clapper

321
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
Dude having to talk about overthrowing

322
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
None of this makes sense

323
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503
Is all just random b******* right and making

324
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Connections where they aren't

325
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Do you think understand words

326
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Probably

327
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
At least

328
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Is a literal wolf

329
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say

330
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
So it gets weird

331
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
It gets weirder

332
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
Here is some information that Alex Jones got

333
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
From his source

334
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
About

335
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
Indicted

336
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Remember

337
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
Of the trumpet

338
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
So real

339
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
When was

340
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
By others

341
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Do what

342
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Flynn

343
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Resurgence

344
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,791
He is describing

345
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
Describing

346
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
To get everyone against the wall

347
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Flynn

348
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
Into the government

349
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
In order to Rendezvous with Alexa

350
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:10,015
With that he's a big fan of making America great again

351
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
What does means you commit in Arabic

352
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
That's absurd

353
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,440
Is completely absurd

354
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,512
So qanon is going on

355
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
On the internet

356
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Don't quite match the

357
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,568
The outside Charizard crazy loud right now

358
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Alex is down

359
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
Sorry I bumped up Alex

360
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,248
Qanon post on

361
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,576
About him and he or she would post

362
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,512
Before the storm which is a reference to that weird, that Trump made

363
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
With a bunch of generals when they were having a picture

364
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
Taken before the storm gentleman

365
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,216
Whichever one assumed

366
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,288
You were about to attack North Korea which is probably

367
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
More accurate to his mentality than

368
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
As opposed to being like

369
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
Hey let's get a weird internet meme going

370
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
Call Zach before the attack

371
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,160
It would be like

372
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Zach is so real you guys

373
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
F*** you

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
For real though

375
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
But like

376
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
Sew-ins next clip Alex

377
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Really expresses what

378
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Kiipix about

379
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
The Calm before the

380
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216

Like completely blow-up and millions of people

397
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
You'll get mixed up in

398
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Qanon stop

399
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552

Can't handle this

403
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
It's for Hillary for prison

00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
This Christmas Eve stuff because I think it's important

407
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Really established

What is buying Savage no I don't know any of it

409
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
Find out pretty easily if you just Google it

410
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,224
I've looked into it and I can't explain it

411
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,928
You have a lot of really cryptic

412
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,304
Vague clues about stuff that if you want to read into after-the-fact

413
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
Oh my God he was trying to get us to look at this

414
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,216
Reverend that I get of a lot of it

415
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:14,336

00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,944
Hawaiian they only take Max should start doing every episode

417
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Mexican update

418
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
I think it's currently worth like a tenth of a cent

419
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:32,256
Currency is going to explode

420
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
In this next clip

421
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,216
We get to a prediction

422
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Zach

423
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,384
Christmas Eve

424
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,968
And whether or not this is

425
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Serious

426
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Stop

427
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
It's good strong

428
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
You

429
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,168
And they're never going to stop

430
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
You must

431
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Give them

432
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
No Quarter

433
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
I mean to kill them

434
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
That's what's going on

435
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Yourself

436
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
The word is

437
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,856

444
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392

445
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
He's Furious

446
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,512
But we now are you recording this on January 11th

447
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
So far

00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
0 attacks on Trump plays this fun game replays all the time that is because we were

450
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
Absolutely this guy is able to do

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
Or whenever something is like

452
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624

Well thank us

455
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,792
You don't know how f****** hard we work for Atlanta runaway to Morocco

456
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,912
This next clip is gross and it's about

457
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Alex

458
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
This sucks

459
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,824
The next group is Alex Jones lying about the Trump

460
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Peter Lorre

461
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Is not a good

462
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,224
Jocelyn Elders level

463
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
Decide this next clip Jordan

00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
Is Christmas Eve

465
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,888
It's gross and it's just Alex Jones lying about Trump busting a pedophile Networks

466
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
Then I only want to play

467
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Because

468
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Listen to this

469
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,568
And keep in mind that he is forced

470
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Rob Dyrdek's wife

471
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
Rob Dyrdek

472
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
And Alex's wife

473
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
Infowars Studios

474
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
Christmas Eve

475
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:41,440
Screaming out like a petty little child about how she hopes and getting enough attention

476
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Save this

477
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
The storm is real

478
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
The removal

479
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Whipped

480
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
6 month old baby

481
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
Coming out

482
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
You take one of these arrests

483
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Chanel a100

484
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Florida

485
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Just real quick

486
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
I only reason is because that

487
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,184
Hundreds arrested in La wasn't going back to The Narrative of the year

488
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,768

00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Slater

490
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,376
Using that same article in KTLA

491
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,264
Certification for his bulshit narrative about Trump going after pedophiles

492
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
I've done so much research in the last week

493
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,152
Into the reality or falsity of those claims

494
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,992
Be coming out real soon about it

495
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Edit

496
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:42,368
It's amazing the work that is going on and how much Alex is lying

497
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Disgust

498
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
Biggest question that I have

499
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
Pedophilia is

500
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Is awful

501
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
Is anybody in 2016

00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:01,824
I don't want I mean I don't know what else to say I don't know rubbing it on you right like there's nothing else

503
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
To do I don't know

504
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:07,712
I don't know I think the depravity of the human mind Knows No Limits

505
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,504
We need to get our own

506
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,600
Let's not

507
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
I will be a Jordan project

508
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,744
So here's the rest of the Gods give me the best ones

509
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
Because they don't want you to know

510
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
News

511
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
They don't want you

512
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Troll

513
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
Who wanted to have sex

514
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Children

Also Merry Christmas

516
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Kill

517
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
And so

518
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:02,752
Wish you would have come back

519
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Pause would like

520
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,104
Merry Christmas Rob Ben's child

521
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,832
You could probably see his brain going

522
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
That's not

523
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
True

524
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
I should have said that

525
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,536
Where

526
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,144
I'm getting to the point where even The Young Turks

527
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,520
Deeply anti-semitic narrative specifically it's not just a small podcast called

528
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
It's getting it anymore

529
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,384
I shouldn't have said that on Christmas

530
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,224
Boy Little Drummer Boy

531
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
Keep going

532
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
Meddlesome up Christmas Eve for you

533
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
And things

534
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Do you mean in general

535
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,256
Like with that was that bore of like a holistic

536
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
Christmas Eve honestly

537
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
That was better than Microsoft

538
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:06,496
That's true you sent me some very Alex Jones

539
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,056
That studio over where I was

540
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
You think I need you to take away I think

541
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
The things that we've

542
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
We've discussed in that is

543
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
Alex's incredibly curious

544
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
That more people aren't paying attention

545
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,976
Everyone loves qanon he thinks millions of hits and he's not cuz everyone is hurt

546
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
Alex crywolf so many goddamn times

547
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
In his attempt

548
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
To bolster Zacks reputation

549
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
What is ended up doing is

550
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Number one

551
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
Anyone who knows

552
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
If he's a real person

553
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
If it's not just a month

554
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
I believe it's a month

555
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,408
Do you know how I know he isn't

556
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
Nobody has ever been hired by the FBI or the

557
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
CIA

558
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
Do you spell zit vaq

559
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:05,376
Alright okay so again

560
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
What's motivating it

561
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
Is Alex having buyer's remorse

562
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
For not getting in on the ground floor

563
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,336
Much like he kind of feels now into

564
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Bitcoin

565
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
He feels a bit like that

566
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
I don't know

567
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
I don't fucken understand

568
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,832
Pizzagate

569
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,392
Not willing to get on board with qanon

570
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,672
And now it's too late

571
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,976
Got screwed by Y2K goes all the way back

572
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
So anyway

573
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,608
Now we get to January 10th

574
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
We are now in

575
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Enter January 10th

576
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,496
Just fun

577
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,056
Reminder of the world exist

578
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Outside of

579
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
Alex's

580
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
Psychodrama that he's having

581
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
Currently

582
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,272
And that is

583
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Sikorsky

584
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
He's talking about Steve Bannon

585
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
2 by himself

586
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
Other people

587
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,920
That's not a good thing to say Rodger you should not have pointed that out

588
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,528
Because once again that is something that is under

589
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:33,440
You should definitely not have been like hey Robert by the way I know Trump really well and he has been stealing people's money

590
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
For a long time

591
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,864
He's not allowed to take money from Americans any more like if we were super conspiracy-minded

592
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,472
Inclined to think that's Rodger Stone trying to publicly like lay track

593
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:51,872
Be like

594
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,248
That's like him trying to not know he was mobbed up

595
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
He's a master of music

596
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,392
The f*** off

597
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,792
Why would you abbreviate that if you're about to say exactly what the abbreviation

598
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
What the abbreviation

599
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,144
It's not like it's not a common abbreviation

600
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Walking around money

601
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
I know that I know

602
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,592
Well maybe that's what he's going with OPP other people's property

603
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Pretty sure

604
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
It's talking about f****** other people's girlfriend

605
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
I just meant

606
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,624
Rodger Stone wasn't going okay

607
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
Remember the clip-ins

608
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
Oh yeah okay

609
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Also before

610
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Who cares

611
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,776
Indicates that it's absolutely obvious that Rodger Stone

612
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Source

613
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,616
Information he was feeding to Alex over the course

614
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,456
How's that going to last year-and-a-half

615
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,760
Because they now start using

616
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
The narratives that

617
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,368
Work in the past throw Bannon under the bus

618
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Okay

619
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
That's PetSmart

620
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,512
It's not a smart idea it's not bad but they never bring up

621
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,376
Right

622
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,472
Maybe one day we'll do is I'll put together an entire report on

623
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:26,336
All of those receipts

624
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Cracked you actually get to Trump and your

625
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,272
You're a you're dropped if you become a truck.

626
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
A long list of things that Rodger stone is

627
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
No cuz though

628
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
All of our donors are

629
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Good thing

630
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
Policy wonks foreign policy wonk technocrats globalist

631
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:49,632
They're all good things restraint Technologies

632
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,192
Advances in society in a great way

633
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
I just know I don't think that

634
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
The crap part that

635
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
I guess everybody in

636
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,384
Susan. This is worth debating

637
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
So Jordan

638
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Now

639
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
We're going to jump in

640
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
To the narrative

641
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
But Alex Jones cell

642
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
The Narrative you have been masturbating

643
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Mooreland path.

644
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,720
The show on

645
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
The tent is not all that eventful

646
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,352
What you end up seeing is Rodger Stone throwing

647
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
Saying the band is responsible for all the globalist

648
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
That were in the administration

649
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Like Rex Tillerson

650
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
Rex Tillerson is neck

651
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
All that sort of stuff

652
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
She does that

653
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
And then

654
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:37,504
Evan Rex Ryan is after him

655
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,320
After that your ex is after them

656
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
When I was five

657
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
That

658
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,792
Alex Jones has this guy who owns a gun shop in Washington on the show

659
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,120
Who had a transgender antifa member

660
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,704
Come into the shop and throw a Bible around or something like that

661
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
It's nonsense

662
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568
Excuse me for 40 minutes

663
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,640
Read interviews the guy about her for 40 minutes

664
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
Is a

665
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
0

666
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
And was like

667
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,184
You guys do anything illegal

668
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
No

669
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,096
In the name of passive aggressive conversation

670
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:28,960
On the way out customer is like

671
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
One of these is going on here in the guys like

672
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
Holy Bible

673
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,616
You can take it if you want

674
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
She's like

675
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
We what I would do

676
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,784
Alex is Joe he's just going on and on about how like

677
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,816
Yeah and that was that so

678
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,192
I watched the video and Madeline of being a dick absolute

679
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
Customer was being a dick

680
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
But it's enough

681
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Has it, but it's a 0

682
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
H20

683
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
So I don't really care all that much

684
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Minutes

685
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,528
Crazy

686
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Nothing

687
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Third hour

688
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Rolls around

689
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Yeah

690
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Are we getting

691
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Emeritus

692
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
That almost

693
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Almost ruined

694
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,352
Right

695
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Finally feeling like Christmas

696
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
No

697
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
Three weeks later though

698
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
Alex

699
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Jumpsend

700
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
And

701
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,624
Alfred form

702
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,000
Both in Europe the third world

703
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Document

704
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,888
George soros's son who does honcho

705
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,216
Most of the women's marches

706
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
Led by Linda sorcerer with her

707
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,408
Ulcers

708
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,576
Skittermander is wrong

709
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,904
We're showing

710
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,720
So you picking up on what's going on yet

711
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
I'm not sure

712
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
Okay what's your sense of it

713
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,864
My sense of it is that

714
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
His narrative

715
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
Terrible

716
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,776
What if we put them all together in a big narrative

717
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
Right

718
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
Everything that I've been yelling about

719
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Magically

720
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Has proved

721
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
What if

722
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
We find the MacGuffin

723
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,904
What if we find exactly

724
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
Well if you

725
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Understand

726
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
Fiction I think it has

727
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
His soul

728
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:10,240
Briefcase right other we get a little glimpse of some stall here but let's get it

729
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
Explains a little bit more what he's talkin about

730
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
The documents report to show

731
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,736
Disclosure agreements and contracts

732
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,088
Baltimore

733
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Civil

734
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:38,656
Martial law Nationwide

735
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,520
Martial law

736
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
What we know

737
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,296
Providence of the documents

738
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
Bi

739
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
The Grudge

740
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
No you f******

741
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,792
But first of all want to go anywhere near the FBI right now

742
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
Someone cares

743
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,448
Wouldn't report this without figuring it out

744
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Get on air

745
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,592
Before you knew over the documents

746
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,664
So what we're working with Joey is in the Christmas

747
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
Spirit it's the Lord's prophet

748
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
Indeed so what are your thoughts so far

749
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,440
In what way would an NBA for

750
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
The antifa members to call civil rights

751
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Civil unrest

752
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,096
Any legal legal action abilities

753
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:46,496
Cuz crime and NBA's don't cover that

754
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,336
That would be first of all

755
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,735
Alright what have you sign this non-disclosure agreement for the murders you're about to commit

756
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
Now that's a Contract Killers

757
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,087
But have them sign an NDA

758
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,647
In this context what it would be is

759
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Absolutely

760
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,023
Causing deaths causing property damage

761
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,631
Potentially overthrowing the government

762
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:19,007
If you have them sign in NBA that only makes you more

763
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,871
Rite Aid no one wouldn't know when you would do that

764
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,943
You still got some sort of deniability but if it's like

765
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,319
Also I'm going to put my signature on here telling you to commit crimes

766
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
Completely forgot what I was going

767
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
I blank

768
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
No

769
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
No

770
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,911
Linda sarsour

771
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
You know the NBAA NBA that's Alex

772
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
There

773
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,407
Tournament March Madness is amazing the ndaa Runza

774
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:03,039
A very amazing truck cuz I do my impression of the NBA

775
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
Snitches get stitches

776
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Exactly this is

777
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Medium is next clip

778
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
Talked a little bit more about these documents

779
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,983
He gets into

780
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,775
Some complaints

781
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
About what

782
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Is doing today

783
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,431
Documents

784
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,991
This never ends is

785
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
That's the end of

786
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:38,367
The interview with the gun store owner who maybe had a Bible thrown at

787
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Maybe

788
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,023
Probably never ends never ends

789
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,839
He's trying not to get that Bible throat

790
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,471
Incredible

791
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
Rally Pro Trump rally

792
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,015
Cuz if they are you staring at their finger on the trigger

793
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,551
I just can't do it

794
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,207
So there's a video of Owen Shroyer from a couple months back where he went to a

795
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
There was

796
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,607
A rally that would be put together about Katie

797
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,423
That's a woman who was accidentally killed

798
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
By an illegal immigrants

799
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Who's gone

800
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:31,615
Fired and hit the ground everybody was like

801
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,431
F****** crazy that was a freak accident

802
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,991
That's crazy and he ended up being

803
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
Not guilty because

804
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,831
He wasn't guilty of murder

805
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,671
Yeah and so people had a reactionary rally about that

806
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,071
And so I watched the entire video there's just a bunch of people who have shields

807
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
Owen Shroyer from getting through

808
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:58,239
Yeah I'm are there standing there and behind the people

809
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,263
Brooke Shields

810
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Has a rifle

811
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:06,175
He has a point downward he hasn't pointed downward and his hand is towards the trigger

812
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,735
It's unclear if its fingers on the trigger or not

813
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,295
But it is near where the trigger is

814
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,415
Like one of the guys with the shield

815
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
Are you scared

816
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
You're shaking

817
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,559
Probably wasn't even

818
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,351
Instead of gun is later on

819
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
He's like you guys have guns

820
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,215
Second Amendment

821
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
Expect that from you

822
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:38,175
Blazy anytime somebody has a pro-gun rally or like

823
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,247
Hands down the idea that this guy was brandishing the gun

824
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
He wasn't

825
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,111
Just having a gun brand

826
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,183
Just for fun I went through a bunch

827
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,767
Videos of open carry rally

828
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,839
At least 15 images of people carrying a gun exact

829
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
Play the same way.

830
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
A lot of people doing

831
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,727
They were also brandish

832
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Their weapons

833
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
They are saying that the legal definition of brand

834
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
Threatening someone to directly with a gun

835
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
It was pointed at Owen Shroyer and it wasn't

836
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,415
Legal definition of probably I don't know

837
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
Weird I don't care enough because I found

838
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
Exactly the same behavior

839
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:29,375
Being done by people Healthcare.

840
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
I just

841
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,567
Reverse

842
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Wish I did

843
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
That

844
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Shaw

845
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,111
The bully knowing that I just felt guilty that I just can't handle it more

846
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:56,511
These people are the scum of the earth literally funded by

847
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
And then

848
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,983
Dozens of countries

849
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:23,647
I gave billion dollars

850
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,327
Does the spirit cooking Aleister Crowley

851
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,567
I guess that's how the cow ate the cabbage

852
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,431
So the only thing I really want to bring out of that cuz we go over this all the time

853
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,015
Collaborate

854
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,831
A very unfair characterization of what

855
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
He did to survive

856
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
If you want to paint him in the worst

857
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Possible light

858
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,999
He went along with his godparents

859
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
When they went and

860
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
Took possession

861
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,375
From people who are already been taken to camp

862
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
Skull

863
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
Somehow it

864
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
Traitor to the Jewish population

865
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
Or that he rounded up Jews

866
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
Is a storage lien accurate

867
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
And Alex uses back

868
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,199
ABC news interview to defend himself

869
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,247
Selectively edited

870
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Just the parts

871
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
What sound

872
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,831
Make Soros sound the most

873
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,159
And that's the reason people take issue with

874
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:33,023
His betrayal

875
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
What was Alex

876
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,703
It wasn't very anti

877
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,055
Who's pretty anti-putin

878
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,639
Exactly

879
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
Politician

880
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
And Ukraine

881
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
Was being ousted from Power

882
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,039
Is now

883
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,391
And that's the reason that he he brings that up as an example

884
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,975
George Soros didn't overthrow their government he may have given some support

885
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,815
To financial support or logistical support to

886
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,119
Movements that already existed their butt

887
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
That doesn't mean you overthrew the government

888
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,703
In the same way he didn't crash economy

889
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
Play the stock

890
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,847
Malaysian plane

891
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
Is the equivalent of

892
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
Or something like that is absurd and you know what dates back to

893
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,759
The Rothschilds

894
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
Do you know about this

895
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Oh my God

896
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,951
Okay I might have to pull up a couple notes Here

897
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,791
Nathan Nathan Rothschild

898
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,095
It was the Battle of Waterloo

899
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:45,727
It was a situation this is the story that's told over and over again

900
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,495
Messenger

901
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:52,895
Battle of Waterloo

902
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
And was going to lose

903
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,967
He was able to get the message back

904
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Nathan Rothschild

905
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,039
Who is able to use that information

906
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,855
To trick people into

907
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
Stock market

908
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:08,767
So he could buy everything up

909
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,303
Right right right

910
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
The truth of it is

911
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
That

912
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,727
Comes from a 1940 Nazi

913
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Propaganda

914
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
Of course of course

915
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Why would

916
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,151
The Nazis

917
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
Statutory

918
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Set story legitimately has

919
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
No historical basis

920
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
Outside of this movie

921
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
From 1940 that Hitler Commission

922
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
It was the first

923
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,951
Piece of Nazi propaganda

924
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
That was put out

925
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
Official

926
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
Production

927
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
At the problem with girdles

928
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:50,495
Mega Mega Movie lasting effects so that mentality persist to this day

929
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
And Alex is manifesting

930
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
In terms of George Soros

931
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,871
In his idea that he shorts these Market

932
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,687
Play in order to

933
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,759
Destroyed

934
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,551
We'll just

935
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,951
Comparison just like Steve Carell in The Big Short was the one who caused the financial crash right like that

936
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,279
That worked

937
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,399
Are we going to know I didn't

938
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:24,799
I have no I had a note of the name of the movie and I wanted to get it right so I didn't sound like an idiot

939
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:29,919
The Nazi propaganda from 1940s called die Rothschild Waterloo

940
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
I believe it's

941
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,223
De Rothschild

942
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
That's something

943
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:41,439
Anyway the point is another example of a mother

944
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:49,375
But it's just another example of classic anti-semitic narratives

945
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,447
Flanders that have perpetuated over and over the years

946
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
Metallica

947
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,519
22in is a piece of his world

948
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,823
And is a piece of what he believes about the global

949
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Anyway

950
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
Going to get worse

951
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,271
Was Alex going to screen some more about George Soros complaining

952
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,295
It's somehow these

953
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,903
I'm in 30 seconds later

954
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,207
Slanders George Soros

955
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
In a legal way

956
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,535
Because of his free speech

957
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,119
So it's really ironic that he's complaining about these things while manifesting

958
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
What gives

959
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,191
Can cover

960
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
Enjoy it

961
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
It gets a little lamb

962
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,991
Alex Jones made it out the George Soros isn't was a Nazi collaborator

963
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:48,511
It's not even a bad you know what, Danny

964
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:52,095
Probably Charlie Sheen

965
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
And I'm like wow

966
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,959
Not that they would have killed him if he didn't do it

967
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
They would have killed him

968
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,799
If they would have figured out who he was

969
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,591
The little different

970
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,383
He was rounding up to

971
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:11,295
Position is

972
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
I'm not going to lift a finger up

973
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
I'm going to go help the Nazis

974
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,583
Help them

975
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
Worse than the Nazi

976
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Point of order

977
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
It's not Soros

978
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,775
I'm calling you

979
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,359
Because you're so much like stranger old people today

980
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,551
Deep creep you're looking

981
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,343
Where do they get the

982
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
Creepy Town Alex

983
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,743
Are you really ready to go on another ramp

984
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,071
About the appearance of a Jewish person

985
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,167
At least he's got a track record

986
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,359
I mean

987
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,663
That time on the bad ones

988
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,159
Do you really need to know

989
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
No

990
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,743
Ate ate something that was tied up in pizza

991
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
The gate

992
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,303
Cystic

993
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
Experience

994
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,631
Where people have like a model

995
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
And stuff like that may pretend that they're eating

996
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
Parts of their body

997
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:38,079
Sushi thing but he just elevated to another creepier level

998
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,407
Great I believe Maria

999
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,967
The artist was involved in some of that stuff

1000
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
That's why Alex has he

1001
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,647
Satanic cooking with breastmilk or mental

1002
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,927
Or something like that

1003
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:57,791
But who Among Us is not

1004
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:04,191
What's more likely is more likely is that there is like similes of Mensa

1005
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:06,751
Which

1006
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
I would like to remind Alex of uber

1007
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,847
You are exactly right.

1008
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,199
Did not need to know it's all it's all accepted only people care about because

1009
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,783
Artistic wingdings doing dinner party

1010
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,087
It's basically like if you're really rich

1011
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
You don't want to have a Murder Mystery Dinner Party

1012
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
If you're poor you also don't want to have a burger

1013
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
But if your me

1014
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,791
Let's do it

1015
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,863
I want to invite over three dinner party once and I end up having

1016
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,263
Play two characters cuz I'm going to show up and the other didn't

1017
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,663
Murder Mystery Dinner

1018
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:52,063
No I was like friends having a Murder Mystery Dinner Party

1019
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,023
Carillon behind

1020
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
About

1021
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,215
Cultural psychology

1022
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,287
Add just understands it

1023
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
He thinks he's going to beat you

1024
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Jew

1025
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
Out of

1026
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,927
Mines

1027
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,559
And look at that narcissism

1028
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
Smile

1029
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,079
Alex Soros smiling

1030
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
Big Bad Wolf

1031
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,807
That makes sense munchkin and added sugar

1032
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
Give me a break

1033
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Sure

1034
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
I'll give you a break

1035
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,791
Did you take that bar no I knew that was coming so we only think I'm going to break you did it before I could

1036
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Stinks

1037
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,375
It stinks bad

1038
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,775
Well I mean that you look like it's not as overt as the drunk on the children's block

1039
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,103
You're a backstabber

1040
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,199
Even in that language even throughout that last clip he's talking about

1041
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,991
Alex Soros is appearance

1042
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
He's relating that

1043
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,807
Who is

1044
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:37,023
Which means that he's thinking about them the same way

1045
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,863
Ugly it's not

1046
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
Maybe it's not

1047
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,959
And maybe it's more Alex

1048
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,007
Doesn't understand how smiles

1049
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,335
That's possible because he doesn't know how to

1050
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:59,295
Experience human Joy maybe it's just

1051
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:07,231
Like maybe that's more what it is never seen Barons teeth

1052
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
There we go

1053
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:18,239
We just figured out the way hold on I don't care I don't care I've seen pictures of Alex Soros my

1054
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,031
I don't think it looks all that creepy

1055
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:30,271
Young and rich or if you're rich

1056
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,319
Yourself I don't give a s*** like

1057
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,415
Send him a lot of it comes from

1058
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
I wish I could

1059
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,791
I think a lot of it comes more for my self-righteous bulshit

1060
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,839
Wherein I am filled with loathing

1061
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,655
For me

1062
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Jealousy

1063
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,775
Sauropod

1064
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:55,103
Add point

1065
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
The Battle of Waterloo I did

1066
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,735
So I just introduced the

1067
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,063
Documents

1068
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:09,951
Even from the jump you can tell it's kind of weeks over to the Linda sarsour

1069
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:15,327
Narratives are going to leave your women

1070
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:21,727
Because they wanted slave your women and then getting into Soros screaming about like

1071
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,263
Launches into a

1072
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,359
And so you know it's fun though is that he's using rhetoric

1073
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,663
Very similar to Jackie Mason

1074
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
Which is like

1075
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,759
I'm in the Linda sarsour and then the thing and then

1076
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
It's very fascinating to me that he's even

1077
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,695
A prominent Jewish

1078
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Absolutely not intention

1079
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,351
Alex gets back to the doctor

1080
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,263
Probably save himself from getting sued in about a week

1081
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
And then

1082
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,455
Proof of organized crime and terrorism

1083
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:07,551
Convertible

1084
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
That's why

1085
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
In the Playbook

1086
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Manufactured by

1087
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
B

1088
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,663
This is huge

1089
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,735
So the timeline that doesn't quite work

1090
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,527
Cuz in August

1091
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
2070

1092
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
Alright

1093
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,623
So

1094
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
Right

1095
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,927
Fails

1096
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Because America

1097
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
Two came together which

1098
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,999
I don't think anybody believe

1099
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Snow

1100
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,327
Because of the Houston

1101
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
Hurricane Harvey

1102
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,679
But I've been in August of 2017

1103
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
A good

1104
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,775
Nion what would that be

1105
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,359
10 weeks 7 months

1106
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
The laptop is yet

1107
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
I don't understand how that work

1108
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,831
Cuz it wasn't even Obama's Department of Justice

1109
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,111
It was still there

1110
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,975
Such a blessing to take an ovary fired Sally Yates

1111
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,327
I don't know

1112
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:30,239
I honestly don't know what that mean first of all

1113
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,775
Good call Alex on the

1114
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,311
If these are real

1115
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:39,711
Them at all if you don't know if they're real that's clunky and

1116
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,735
Amateurish

1117
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
But

1118
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,575
You might be in Safe Harbor as long as you don't

1119
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Renault

1120
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,183
Overwhelmingly present them as true to your audio

1121
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,231
As long as you avoid that you'll be

1122
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
Probably lawsuit

1123
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Yes

1124
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Tell

1125
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
You got to make more

1126
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,239
If they're real

1127
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,031
Here's what I was going to say

1128
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,103
Here's what Alex wants to see happen if they're true

1129
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,735
Soros and others give the documents reveal

1130
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:19,647
He's already earlier said you can't give him any quarter I had obviously probably italics Joneses conception means that you got to kill him

1131
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,207
Well obviously if they are true

1132
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:29,375
No Doubt

1133
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Alex

1134
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,239
We do agree in Asia

1135
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:40,639
Certainly will. I made his statement like if you look at it from just a pure logic perspective absolutely saying a truth

1136
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:44,479
Good argument as much as if true you must act

1137
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
Fortunate

1138
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,551
If Rainbow Brite

1139
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:52,671
Comes to life in the form of a doll and murders my best

1140
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
Yeah

1141
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
You might need to ask

1142
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
You must get revenge

1143
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
Absolutely

1144
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,631
I'm so

1145
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Earlier

1146
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
In this episode we heard

1147
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
Alex coming in from break

1148
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
Do Rammstein

1149
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:14,431
America which is my new favorite song I realize that later in the episode

1150
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,247
Alex comes back from break with another ROM

1151
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
Current song I think

1152
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
He's getting into a

1153
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:25,695
Little weird to me a little weird I'm not comfortable with it right but he gets into it

1154
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,743
If this is so f****** funny to me

1155
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,535
Because he missed Translate

1156
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,935
What do hasta mean

1157
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:48,735
Smoking ribs

1158
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:54,111
I love you

1159
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,463
Helping the Nazis rounded 1000

1160
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,559
George Soros

1161
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
But don't worry

1162
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:21,247
So Alex says that means I hate you.

1163
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,295
You hate me

1164
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
Is Alex

1165
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:29,183
If soros's love letter to the world

1166
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
I mean it is

1167
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,767
From his perspective

1168
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,583
Besoros could sing Du Hast Mich

1169
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,447
That's why it's so stupid Alex could probably sing it back to him

1170
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
I don't think so Rose cares

1171
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,823
Probably

1172
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
Cuz he's going to get someone killed

1173
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,407
He's going to get cirrhosis

1174
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,455
Kids killed or something like that

1175
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:57,343
But that's a little stupid

1176
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,367
It's so bad

1177
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,511
Also

1178
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:10,911
My heart goes out much more strongly.

1179
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
To all the people who are on the ground

1180
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:19,103
You are being affected by

1181
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,151
It's cruel

1182
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
You know but

1183
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:28,575
Misrepresenting with George Soros live through in the hall

1184
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,391
Holocaust

1185
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,439
I think that it's really important

1186
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,255
Exactly what the quote was

1187
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,071
But there's a quote I read about

1188
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,863
Who is dealing with

1189
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,655
Soros's experience

1190
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
The Holocaust

1191
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
And it was

1192
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,543
It was something to the tune of

1193
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
You have no idea what it's like

1194
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,431
To live through something like that

1195
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,271
None of us possibly can

1196
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
At this point especially as Americans

1197
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:01,855
In our exist

1198
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:05,439
You better f****** are on the side of being understanding

1199
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
The part that is like

1200
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,071
I was I was just thinking that other of like

1201
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:15,679
No matter how innocuous dated I have become to Alex Jones is b*******

1202
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,983
There is never not going to be part of it

1203
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:23,871
Coming after a guy who survived the Holocaust

1204
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,151
When when

1205
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,455
F*** you Alex you have

1206
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
Nothing

1207
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,551
Had to survive

1208
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,599
Hiding from the Nazis

1209
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,415
By having his family broken up

1210
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,951
Different countries

1211
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,719
With Ford

1212
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,487
Papers

1213
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
In order for them to survive

1214
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,071
Alex Jones was a s*** head

1215
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:49,471
In Rockwall Texas wealthy suburb of Dallas

1216
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,055
Text with 150 women before the age of 16

1217
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,079
And

1218
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,967
Even if you cry talk is true

1219
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:05,343
Can you imagine the f****** monsters emotional toll it would take on you

1220
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
To be like

1221
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
I'm going to survive at all costs

1222
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,743
Means that I'm going to do whatever it is I need

1223
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
Deserve

1224
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,535
And now I'm

1225
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,071
Listen in all of the

1226
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,119
This f****** a truck but I don't take

1227
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,959
I don't I don't give a goddamn

1228
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,727
Holocaust

1229
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,007
Go fuc yourself

1230
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,335
I don't really think that he had to adjust his morals all that

1231
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,175
What Alex says is true

1232
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,503
To be true

1233
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
Still be like

1234
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:39,135
F*** you Alex you're living in a horror movie

1235
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:43,231
That you would stand up for yourself or you would run or something like that

1236
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,535
Human beings

1237
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
We know that

1238
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,839
Probably not going to have

1239
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
No

1240
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,447
More prone to survive at any cost

1241
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:56,543
Then we'd like to imagine like I'm enough to have

1242
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,431
Parent who's able to get you forged documents who is willing to take you in as fake

1243
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
You being there song

1244
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,295
Yeah why would you upset the status quo

1245
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,343
Running and hiding

1246
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,367
When you are

1247
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,927
13 years old and put in that situation

1248
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,975
It's completely absurd

1249
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
It's it's

1250
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:20,351
Then it's Menace level whatever George Soros has done in his life I'm sure

1251
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,375
He's not a saint

1252
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,215
But they are largely just like

1253
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
Capitalism

1254
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,543
Yeah sucks but that's capitalism

1255
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,199
All of it's irrelevant to what he had to endure when he was a

1256
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
Like a preteen

1257
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
The young team

1258
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
Logo

1259
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,439
It makes me so mad George Soros

1260
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,535
No

1261
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,631
When someone's being made out to be like the most evil person in the world

1262
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,935
Especially based on this sort of like

1263
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,471
Misrepresentation

1264
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,263
The backstory it just makes me so mad

1265
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:04,127
Sew-ins next with Alex Jones but he said earlier it's these documents are

1266
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
True

1267
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,967
Now Alex Jones

1268
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
Into suggesting a

1269
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,039
Couple possibilities

1270
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,063
About these.

1271
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:18,719
Operator

1272
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,631
Document

1273
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,167
He has people

1274
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:27,935
He has

1275
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Heavy quotes

1276
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:33,567
People are the antifa Alex thinks that they're soros's foot soldiers

1277
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:37,407
Adidas dress in Black

1278
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:41,503
Who are

1279
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Little bit

1280
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,063
We have bruising

1281
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,623
During Halloween dresses like a Nazi

1282
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,159
Maybe that hat

1283
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
Especially

1284
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,487
Sandra Bullock

1285
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,303
Terrorism

1286
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:03,007
Declared terrorist by Homeland Security

1287
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
What is all types

1288
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
Bombshell

1289
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:20,415
Show me what is a forgery someone took what they said and done

1290
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,951
I just look

1291
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,863
I look forward to urinalysis

1292
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,423
Possibility

1293
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,447
Surreal

1294
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Which it is

1295
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,543
Or it's someone who knows

1296
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
So much

1297
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
About antifa

1298
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:43,711
Put this together as a elaborate brilliant but only

1299
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,039
In order to prove what antifa really is about

1300
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:54,975
So if I understand correctly Sandra Bullock

1301
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
Almost a year.

1302
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,959
Nobody believed she is actually a nut

1303
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
Is a nut

1304
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,151
So if I understand the possibilities correctly

1305
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,455
It's either they're true

1306
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,295
For their spiritually true yes but one is a fraud

1307
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Yeah but

1308
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,647
What is also correct right and he doesn't really

1309
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
Are all that much

1310
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
Even if it's a fraud

1311
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:31,839
He's been saying course of what we're seeing here already Alex's

1312
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:32,863
Confronted

1313
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,423
Information

1314
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,471
He is deciding like

1315
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,519
And I didn't

1316
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,359
Really blew it On Keepin On

1317
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:48,479
Should have gotten in on the ground floor that I think he's kind of wrestling with this a little bit like

1318
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
Do I jump on this

1319
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
Music

1320
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,111
I got cover my bases what you did earlier said if it's true

1321
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
Now we'll see we'll see how this goes along

1322
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,743
Rochester Pops in for a minute

1323
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,559
Phone call

1324
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,095
And the makeup tips

1325
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:10,495
T.i. still mad at Banning but he has this to say which is just a delightful break from the

1326
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
Narrative that were on

1327
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
I hear nothing

1328
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:19,455
And where are you it was only days ago when Alex Jone

1329
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,951
The climb in the ring with Alex Jones

1330
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
Is

1331
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:35,839
The demon spawn why do we hear nothing but

1332
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,423
I'm going to double down

1333
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,959
I will be Alex

1334
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:46,079
Jones this second I'm laying down the challenge to Jake also known as

1335
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:53,247
Only seconds ago on your screen

1336
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,551
Million-dollar

1337
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:59,647
I'm not riding with me I will be Alex Jones is

1338
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:04,511
Checking my guess the boys house

1339
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,815
Cojones to face.

1340
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:13,471
It's going to be it's going to be Rodger Stone and Alex Jones taking on the roles of Macho Man Randy

1341
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:19,871
Savage and Hulk Hogan in the dungeon of Four Horsemen

1342
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,943
WCW the news of all the

1343
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:28,575
Everything that I have ever seen in this entire year that we have spent doing this

1344
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,367
The only thing I am sure of it

1345
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:36,767
Is Rodger stone is living his best life absolutely assuming especially that closed

1346
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,327
Your testimony

1347
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,887
Some committee like I hope that

1348
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,935
I imagine he probably spilled

1349
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:48,543
How far is it from

1350
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:54,943
Free of legal obligations they're not

1351
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,599
Nobody's going to do this

1352
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:09,535
Billion dollars in for a long time

1353
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:14,655
Be really excited to shoot promo on Jake

1354
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,703
A reason

1355
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,751
You can ring with Jake Tapper

1356
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,823
Drip drip by virtue of age you going to work your bag

1357
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:29,247
Stocks

1358
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,271
It's dignity

1359
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,063
What group has it

1360
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,087
The other doesn't

1361
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:37,951
Tom Arnold

1362
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,047
Experienced when Mike cernovich and Alex Jones were trying to fight him

1363
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:48,447
F*** yes I will absolutely

1364
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:53,055
I have dignity

1365
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:58,175
If you beat me up we make money for charity I don't give a s***

1366
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,247
Oh that's

1367
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,783
Dignity

1368
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,575
I just

1369
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,903
The only character in our

1370
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,743
Sevierville that I am like actively like

1371
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:17,119
Alright dude your women is

1372
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:22,239
2018 the first 11 days so far me that I do think

1373
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,263
Going to get out okay

1374
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
I think he knows something

1375
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:36,319
He has a piece of information that he's even hiding

1376
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,135
In terms of like he has some safety

1377
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,183
I think he has a long list of things

1378
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:46,815
Absolutely there's something there

1379
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,911
I do agree with you I enjoy his job David

1380
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,775
I enjoy his freedom

1381
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:59,103
Clearly doesn't give a s*** about the narrative

1382
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,455
I'm not in the petulant way of a Steve pieczenik raised like

1383
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:08,063
I'm trying to get to what I want

1384
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:14,463
Yeah let's roll with the punches dude I got what I got time I'm not doing anything but this is something that comes back over and over again in my

1385
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
Meijer

1386
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
Analysis

1387
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:24,447
I keep coming back just like all these people are are mammoths

1388
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,727
And they're all evil

1389
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:29,823
The zombie parade but there's different degrees of principle

1390
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:34,175
In them and it's fascinating to me because I sincerely believe

1391
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,247
Did Steve pieczenik probably believe most of the

1392
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
The stuff

1393
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,295
At least what

1394
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,831
Be kind most of the stuff

1395
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,879
That he

1396
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,183
And there's a there's a much lower incidence

1397
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,231
What's of the like race narrative

1398
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,535
Generally speaking

1399
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
There is just

1400
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,143
Fear of the intelligence state

1401
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
It's full of s*** bunch.

1402
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,495
Hook being fake

1403
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,519
Vegas being

1404
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,823
A fake butt

1405
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,615
The rest of it he's

1406
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:07,711
You can do within the realm of like a guy who has a point

1407
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,247
Yeah don't just seems like

1408
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:17,951
Something but he also he also really wants to have a good time

1409
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,583
Rodger Stones chaotic

1410
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
Living his best life

1411
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,679
Yeah and I love it and Alex's

1412
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,007
Drunk evil

1413
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,335
No bass nothing

1414
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,639
Absolutely no Center.

1415
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,063
He's just evil evil

1416
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,855
So now we jump back

1417
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
Into the neck

1418
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
We get back into the

1419
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
The the

1420
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,023
Alex Jones

1421
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,047
Discusses

1422
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,119
In the area

1423
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Panda

1424
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,751
Document

1425
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,055
Hair on the back of my neck stand up

1426
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,591
Remember

1427
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,455
8 years ago vomiting office about a year-and-a-half

1428
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,527
We got documents from

1429
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
Federal Marshals

1430
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
And then when I

1431
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,951
Police officer

1432
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
In California

1433
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,047
Information

1434
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:31,423
What's exact center

1435
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
I know how to look at

1436
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
I don't think

1437
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,567
That your conclusion

1438
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,895
Matches your support for your conclusion

1439
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,967
Any sense at all

1440
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,551
Someone else contacted me

1441
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,599
From California who sent me

1442
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,951
Slightly different document

1443
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,231
PLC was behind it

1444
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,511
Therefore

1445
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,279
I know.

1446
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:02,399
Google doc out there

1447
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
And sent it back to me

1448
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,751
B*******

1449
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
There's a lot of capabilities

1450
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,079
In terms of vibe

1451
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
Fake things

1452
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,943
Back here and Alec reiterate

1453
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,783
Position that he emailed a little bit earlier in the show and I just want to play this again

1454
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,807
Cuz we got a track

1455
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,831
His perspective

1456
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,647
This is

1457
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,719
Maybe 20 minutes into the third hour on these

1458
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,559
I read over these new ones are so huge

1459
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,631
Either somebody super smart

1460
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:39,263
Well we can already roll that up

1461
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:47,199
George Soros

1462
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,479
That quarterback

1463
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
So that's

1464
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,367
It's exactly

1465
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:58,975
Soldier is real for real

1466
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,791
I read these documents

1467
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:06,911
Withholding a number of these thoughts for a specific reason

1468
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:09,983
You f****** tea

1469
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:14,080
I'm not teasing because I ate this is sort of a lead into this next clip

1470
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,408
There's a very important

1471
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:21,248
Holding a piece of information.

1472
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
These documents

1473
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,952
Paris

1474
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
Fortune

1475
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,632
Washington Post

1476
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,448
This is real

1477
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,640
This is a Smoking Gun because we know their funding sources

1478
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,712
New York Times on November

1479
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,064
Starting November 4th

1480
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,328
We're allowed to 20

1481
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,680
Kill the cops this is what they push

1482
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,496
I want to refuse fascism. Org

1483
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:20,896
That's not on there I read their front page it really just seems more about

1484
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:26,784
Refusing to being out in public notice being out

1485
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,576
There's a bump is a listing of events

1486
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
A listing

1487
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
Protest

1488
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
It's like there's one coming up

1489
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,416
Chicago on the 14th

1490
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
An abortion rights

1491
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,864
Pictures of people with signs and what-have-you picture of people dressed up like the

1492
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:48,032
I tried to find any invitations

1493
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:52,896
I mean I've even explored Democratic socialists

1494
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:59,552
I've been to their website of you are officially a Democrat

1495
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:09,280
As much as anybody there are at least

1496
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:12,608
There's not even anything

1497
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:19,008
Violence being entitled because of the evils of capitalism or anything like that

1498
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,592
You and me

1499
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,920
Baby word baby

1500
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:30,784
Very violet

1501
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,576
Clearly I have never done

1502
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,112
That

1503
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,744
My dude

1504
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
How do you feel about that

1505
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,352
Everything I've ever seen unfortunate Zack

1506
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
Yeah

1507
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
What's going on here

1508
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:59,968
What's up

1509
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:05,088
Fortune be like is there a is there a thread going on about these documents

1510
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:13,024
There wasn't must have been like earlier than the day before

1511
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,816
What I did find is

1512
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
Lots of

1513
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,448
A lot of black stuff

1514
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:25,056
A lot of very yet but most of the threads there are full of

1515
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,104
Racism people just telling stories

1516
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,784
A lot of fake stuff

1517
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,552
Footboard

1518
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,600
I was just checking on Pole

1519
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,648
I've only gone today

1520
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,672
Nevermind okay

1521
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:43,232
You do be too specific

1522
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,304
But also there's a lot of it is a

1523
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
I don't want to say anything negative

1524
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,936
I don't want our website to

1525
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,216
But also

1526
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
I don't think that's a

1527
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:04,224
I think generally do not go there

1528
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,296
And at the same time like there's

1529
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,600
There's a certain sort of

1530
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:14,720
I don't know it's not admiration but more like respective

1531
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
Hey man

1532
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,376
Free Speech can go too far but it's still free speech I guess I don't know what to say

1533
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,704
With only a very few

1534
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,984
Instances where I

1535
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:32,384
Agree with that

1536
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,456
You've got this and I'm going to use as a slight cliffhanger

1537
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,224
Have to go to the bathroom

1538
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,528
We are going to make it make

1539
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:43,136
Incredibly rare intermission

1540
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Alex Jones

1541
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,976
It's presenting as either real or created by someone

1542
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,280
Music apps

1543
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,840
He happened to find on 4chan

1544
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,656
Where does he go with a narrative

1545
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:57,472
Find out when knowledge fly Preserve

1546
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,240
Castle

1547
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,968
Bareback sorry about that

1548
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,296
F*** you Jordan

1549
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Squires

1550
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,648
Controlling a bladder

1551
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,976
We're not professionals we are amateurs

1552
01:26:55,232 --> 01:27:01,120
Qualify for the Olympics that is a very good point

1553
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,424
Now I wish there was an Olympics got it

1554
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:10,080
You know what you know how Sports

1555
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
Category in this year's Olympics

1556
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
64 South Korea like they have something like that right let's go to go to South Korea at this point

1557
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,088
Saw that be great

1558
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:27,488
If you're just joining us

1559
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:32,608
So we've established that Alex Jones

1560
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,192
Unfortunate researchers have

1561
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:39,008
And he's presenting them as either

1562
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,544
Kids

1563
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,336
I hope her accident going to 4chan

1564
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:48,736
He's next.

1565
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,016
Rex Chapman has dunk

1566
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:56,416
Sunday is a great job trying to work on the opioid crisis and we appreciate if God bless your ex cabin

1567
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,256
Where's the next clip

1568
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,536
Tell you my man

1569
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,584
The Steele dossier

1570
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
Bulshit

1571
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,912
More and more true everyday

1572
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,240
The documents he has just found on 4chan

1573
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,800
Probably

1574
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:17,408
The material in the Russian dossier is too old

1575
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,688
Nope

1576
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,480
Nope

1577
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
Definitely not

1578
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:27,648
Documents.

1579
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,184
Non-disclosure document

1580
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
And contract

1581
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,560
Typos mean it's true again

1582
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,376
We go back to your immediate response

1583
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:41,728
Something I wanted to bring up and I'm so thrilled you picked up on it immediately

1584
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:45,824
The idea of an MBA in this situation is ridiculous

1585
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,688
It is only something that someone trying to slander or speaker somebody

1586
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:55,808
Once we get into the details of what is intestine

1587
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,112
There should be red flag

1588
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,904
Literally everywhere

1589
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,208
He brings never heard on the show

1590
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:02,976
The researcher

1591
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,816
He gets into breaks out

1592
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,376
He starts off on a decent foot

1593
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,144
He trips

1594
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,424
Almost immediately

1595
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,240
But his perspective on his is first

1596
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,008
Look

1597
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
Get the documents

1598
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
I kind of agree with

1599
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,592
Please

1600
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,992
George soros's

1601
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,808
Alexander Soros

1602
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,776
The Smoking Gun and

1603
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:53,920
Figure out whether or not these are authentic

1604
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:02,112
What

1605
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:02,880
It sounds like

1606
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Absolutely

1607
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:18,496
You're not you're misrepresenting comments that people have made in order to build up a narrative and now this

1608
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,568
Obviously fake document his come out

1609
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,872
Happens to mysteriously match

1610
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,688
Deepfake version of things that you've experienced

1611
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,712
And I like

1612
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,760
That's the thing that's

1613
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Gets me is like

1614
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:36,416
These the idea of any anytime I hear something that sounds like some

1615
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,976
Something that I want to be a mediately like

1616
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,840
F*** off I'm going to do as much research as I can because if I want this

1617
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:50,240
To be true that means I'm going to be taken in by these messages online

1618
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:56,896
Do you want to come over and have sex and my response back block

1619
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:04,576
This is a trap that's the kind of mentality that really should be

1620
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,624
Call this researcher

1621
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,928
But like I said he has a second of it

1622
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,976
What do you mean really Falls over

1623
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:16,608
He goes along with whatever Alex's version of it is

1624
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,656
This is

1625
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,472
Buck Michael Steele

1626
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,288
A lifelong spy

1627
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:30,688
No I didn't say proven track record at a great history of something

1628
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,480
4chan never heard of it

1629
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,784
So you might be asking yourself about this

1630
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,088
What is a story

1631
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,648
I am actually asking myself that

1632
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,232
Steel back on what is

1633
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,048
Spirit locking or whatever

1634
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,096
It's complicated

1635
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,936
Evans next clip we will get into the

1636
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
It's backstory

1637
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
But first

1638
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,264
Alex Jones

1639
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
Pugn

1640
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,080
The very idea

1641
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,384
But African-American communities

1642
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,176
Have a right to a voice

1643
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:05,760
Craigslist

1644
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,320
I apologize

1645
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
Great

1646
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,624
2000

1647
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,160
I think they collaborate

1648
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,464
Baltimore riots

1649
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,304
Black lives matter

1650
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,240
So

1651
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,312
2015

1652
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,576
Stuff posted are probably but

1653
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:50,304
Traveling around the United States

1654
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:56,448
So this guy who

1655
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:02,848
Very big misrepresentation

1656
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:08,480
22 program

1657
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,928
Proof of

1658
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:19,232
Of his money

1659
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:26,144
Looking for a certain proof that his brothers may be involved in something

1660
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,168
She took a picture of

1661
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,728
I wish your cell phone in person before chance

1662
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:34,080
That's a s*** story

1663
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,616
I would say

1664
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:36,896
4 number

1665
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,176
I'm sold so far

1666
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,736
True

1667
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,016
There's a guy

1668
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,088
Yep

1669
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,136
Searching for what

1670
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,672
Find these documents

1671
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,720
Wright State of being like

1672
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,536
Probably a good idea to call the FBI

1673
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,376
Probably a good idea

1674
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,656
Pictures of these

1675
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,936
And post them

1676
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:03,264
To a place where people troll like crazy

1677
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,104
Postalease

1678
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,872
To the most

1679
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:12,224
Lying place there's ever been

1680
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,784
I'm going to write a legitimate

1681
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,136
As opposed to just

1682
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:25,536
You know he's not interviewing anybody that's one of his insurance or his research guide

1683
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,120
I don't understand Harrison something I've never heard of on the show before

1684
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,912
And I don't you said it was Harrison

1685
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Smith earlier

1686
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
You did

1687
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:39,360
I don't know what that to be true is Harrison something I don't I don't know Batman

1688
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:43,456
Little bit of

1689
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,248
A Bridge Too Far

1690
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:48,576
Yeah this idea of that backstory

1691
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:52,160
I've been I've been unfortunate enough times to know that

1692
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,000
Threads that get started on there

1693
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:00,864
Thursday

1694
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,472
A lot of big old titties threads on there but there's a lot of

1695
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:09,568
There's a lot of threads were people are trying to basically workout

1696
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,152
I got work out but like some sort of

1697
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,176
Doing an exercise in

1698
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:19,040
Conviction doing some sort of like emursive interactive fiction Experian

1699
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:23,392
4chan is like an open mic with the worse

1700
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
First people

1701
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,184
On the planet

1702
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,720
Kind of just like an open my

1703
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:27,488
Yeah

1704
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:33,376
So anyway there's a little bit more that Harrison w

1705
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
Explain about

1706
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,680
These documents

1707
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,960
PennDOT to get into it

1708
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:43,104
And it's an action document from the friends of democracy which is a

1709
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:44,896
Pact

1710
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,688
B

1711
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
That

1712
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,552
Its mission statement is to get money out of politics

1713
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,856
I did not even bother

1714
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:57,440
But

1715
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,464
Hard pass

1716
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:04,096
But this is action BWI 04 1815

1717
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:10,496
04 18th is April 18th

1718
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:15,360
Started and it says that the action oversight Committee of the French democracy has determined

1719
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,176
Saturday operation

1720
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,112
To seize as much momentum as possible from current civil unrest in the Baltimore area

1721
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:30,464
Friendly officials in various administrative agencies

1722
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,472
He says that says

1723
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,056
Literally says that

1724
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
It does

1725
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,128
Literally

1726
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,968
Confirm something that is literally zelk

1727
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,528
Okay alright of describing everything

1728
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:57,856
How do you act

1729
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,184
Going to have a specific

1730
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:07,584
That's not a problem at all

1731
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,120
Ironically

1732
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,192
What you do is agitprop

1733
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:24,224
Baltimore officials and law enforcement

1734
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
That is not

1735
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,000
I confirmed it all

1736
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:40,096
Man man oh man

1737
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,912
Alex seems to have zero grasp of

1738
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,216
What this segment is going to be about

1739
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,288
Like his intern does all of this research

1740
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:01,344
He's done it no leg work in terms of Journalism

1741
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,648
You know what you get documents like this

1742
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,464
There's a Hatter on there

1743
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:13,120
Who created

1744
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:17,728
There is an organization can you reach out to the organization

1745
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,496
For ComEd

1746
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:21,568
You try and see my crazy real document that

1747
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:25,920
Came out of your organs

1748
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
Of course not

1749
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,992
That that by the way

1750
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:29,760
Spoiler alert

1751
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:33,344
That information is not going to be addressed on this episode

1752
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:38,720
Butt tattoo in there but they've tried to work into the narrative is

1753
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
The cops are in

1754
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,584
Which makes perfect

1755
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,400
Right that was the cops

1756
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,168
Commit

1757
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,008
You started the plant Jordan

1758
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,568
I'm getting it now and ironically you're starting

1759
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,408
Got it

1760
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:02,272
I'm so in the next clip Alex takes a little bit of a little bit of

1761
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:05,088
I don't know if I'd call it an adolescent step

1762
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:09,184
It's not a baby step it's not. But it's a step of some sort words

1763
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:12,000
I just outright

1764
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,376
They have signatures at the bottom

1765
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,680
That don't seem like they come from different hands

1766
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,216
I need to restart this

1767
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:21,984
Because

1768
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,288
It's still I believe these are

1769
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,640
He's still hiding behind the

1770
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:35,040
I know they are still like legal there still

1771
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,320
Wiggle room is doing

1772
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,368
Material

1773
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,440
Signatures at the bottom

1774
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:46,560
That all seems like they come from different hands would be hard to fake all these

1775
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
Left

1776
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,152
There's a bunch of spinach

1777
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:07,552
And let me be clear I was I saw these documents I went and looked and read all of them and there is an

1778
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,088
I'd like

1779
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,880
Yeah they're not like

1780
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,672
Photocopies of something

1781
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,488
It isn't like the idea is

1782
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:18,304
This guy who has a loser brother who has money

1783
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:19,840
Parking

1784
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,376
Straight up documents

1785
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:24,192
That were hand sign reliable

1786
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:24,960
Rick

1787
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:28,800
Not not Alex Soros doesn't have the original copy

1788
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,336
Course I miss guy has the

1789
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
Right

1790
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:38,784
I think the only the only thing

1791
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:45,184
Thing I can tell you for sure right now is that this in turn will not be on arrogant Alex's clearly

1792
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:58,752
He just gave every employee hasn't says they're getting new shows like Oprah

1793
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
Basically

1794
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,336
Sorry I was getting around show

1795
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:10,272
I know he wants to go 24 hours and he probably will at some point but not a good idea

1796
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,856
Like just in terms of

1797
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,880
Views on YouTube

1798
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,416
The massive drop-off

1799
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:20,512
Between Alex Jones and David Knight or room

1800
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:23,072
Alex cannot imagine

1801
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:27,168
Hiring somebody who is a Potential Threat to his

1802
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:29,472
He's kind of like a John Cena

1803
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,240
In some ways

1804
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:35,360
Yeah let me spell that out for you I just want to live in a world where Alex

1805
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:38,432
Has Tina has Alex's face

1806
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:45,088
Plaster for a long time John Cena has had like a narrative the storyline that

1807
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:47,392
He's been in this like I run the show

1808
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:49,440
Yeah I'm the big guy here

1809
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:51,488
And I'm waiting for someone

1810
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,768
Come along and Dethrone

1811
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,048
I would love it

1812
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,584
If someone came along if you throwing me

1813
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,144
The courses behavior isn't in line with that he

1814
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:58,912
You know he

1815
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:03,008
Insist on winning over hot new people and stuff like that

1816
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:07,360
But I wish someone would come along and be better than me

1817
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,664
Meanwhile everyone is better than him

1818
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,832
Like legitimately would be a way better version of Alex than Alex

1819
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,392
Because he wouldn't fall for this kind of s***

1820
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,928
You wouldn't fall for a lot of Israel

1821
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,952
Which is why he

1822
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:22,720
He can't be

1823
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:26,560
Recently gone back and watch some scary stuff and he's wrong a lot of the time

1824
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:30,144
But it's such a breath of fresh air

1825
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,680
Like an Infowars logo behind

1826
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,960
Yeah cuz he's

1827
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
Nice

1828
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
Sounds like

1829
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,544
He seems like

1830
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,080
I'm not I know I have

1831
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,104
Just f****** with

1832
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,408
I think of any any other employees

1833
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,432
Of their past that I

1834
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:49,600
I don't think there are any everything that we've looked into Rapaport everything

1835
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:53,184
Everything we've looked into about Jakari Jackson

1836
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,464
Post Infowars like

1837
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,536
You seem like a pretty cool dude man we can hang out

1838
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,352
Even though there are a lot of

1839
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,144
But I'll be there in

1840
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,424
Get on to the next one

1841
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,544
Harrison

1842
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,592
Who will have his own show

1843
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,920
Gibson Court believes to be the most

1844
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:14,688
Troubling

1845
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,480
In this

1846
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,832
Most important one

1847
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:25,440
It's post

1848
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:29,536
It is

1849
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,584
Ideal objective outcome

1850
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:36,704
Civil unrest of Martial law like policies for Baltimore

1851
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:39,520
Literally

1852
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:50,272
Inspire police response

1853
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,088
Now I ask you

1854
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:56,672
Who the f*** would put that in a contract

1855
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,768
I don't understand

1856
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,584
Explain to me why you would put that at

1857
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:09,216
Do you know what what I just signed a contract with my with my new employer

1858
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,776
My entire job is

1859
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,336
Murdering everybody who comes into the office wow

1860
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:30,208
This is so happy

1861
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:36,608
Did such nonsense any idea that okay so if you if you want to go down Alex Jones

1862
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:43,008
You have to believe there is a shadowy global trying to create these

1863
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:49,152
All of these race war riots and what-have-you in Orchard hours

1864
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,456
Secretly

1865
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:58,112
Why the f*** with this organization that allegedly has 18 billion dollars of George Soros his money right

1866
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:00,928
So f****** stupid that they put in a document

1867
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:04,000
Literally no reason here's our end goal

1868
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:08,608
Let's try can get people to fight with the police

1869
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:11,168
Well one part of it is that

1870
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,448
He is fighting against

1871
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,728
The most incompetent

1872
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,752
Organization

1873
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:15,776
Ever

1874
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:19,360
Turn the history of ever it is an organization

1875
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:24,224
Equivalent to mr. Magoo

1876
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,088
Air quotes

1877
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:29,856
You are

1878
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,904
You are going to bed

1879
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:42,144
It don't we all have to choose our own subjugation like

1880
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:43,936
That's nonsense

1881
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,216
Are you sure yes

1882
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,544
Have you ever sign the Apple iTunes license

1883
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,312
I have

1884
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,336
Done great

1885
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,104
Done

1886
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,688
Completely forgot something I meant to do earlier

1887
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,992
Sign the Apple iTunes group

1888
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,552
Explain to you what

1889
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
Zach

1890
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:06,720
Narrative

1891
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
Gotten through

1892
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,512
The first day

1893
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,120
Straight up a punch

1894
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:22,336
I feel like I might have given away a little bit too much

1895
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:25,920
Do all of our live viewers on Twitch

1896
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:32,832
It'll be released as a podcast I have no qualms about what's going

1897
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,600
On right now

1898
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,416
At this point right now Alex Jones

1899
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,440
Is going to explain

1900
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,280
You are possessed

1901
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
Course

1902
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
Harrison

1903
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,096
He's an amateur

1904
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632
Time in India

1905
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,912
Alex Jones

1906
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
Is annex

1907
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,776
Can we get Rodger Stone back

1908
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:54,848
I want to punch

1909
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:58,176
Here's another interesting real or someone

1910
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,760
Profile

1911
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:13,024
Impressive that they were able to fake tan

1912
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,120
Black lives matter Seattle

1913
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:20,960
Initiative

1914
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,640
So again

1915
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,432
You still skirting

1916
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
Like

1917
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,736
Like legal issue

1918
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,016
Probably

1919
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
In terms of being like

1920
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,344
This is real or

1921
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:40,928
Realer than real

1922
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,720
Ted not beer

1923
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,512
If it sucks clip

1924
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,096
Discusses there was a New York

1925
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:50,400
Times full page ad that got put out

1926
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:52,448
About protests

1927
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:57,312
And advocating violence at all

1928
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,104
They have come and gone

1929
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,384
Sam's Fannin

1930
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,920
Route no real virus

1931
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,200
Because happened

1932
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:05,504
Snow White

1933
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:11,904
November 4th narrative that Alex is pushing it was a bunch of bulshit

1934
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:16,000
That we can have about the massive amount of money and

1935
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:18,560
Such that is spent on protests that have

1936
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:21,888
Done

1937
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:31,104
It looks conversation to have later

1938
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,920
You're coming from WhatsApp

1939
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:37,504
Bring that up is because

1940
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,064
Discusses this

1941
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,344
New York Times

1942
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,136
Full page

1943
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,440
And

1944
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,000
I can't take this clip

1945
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:50,304
Is being anything other than Alex Jones

1946
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,120
Pussyfooting around the idea of outlawing protest

1947
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:07,712
What's 1000

1948
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:20,256
Is word for word from that

1949
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:27,168
This really quick it word for word

1950
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
Is not from

1951
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:31,264
No it's not similar to the ad at all

1952
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,336
It's not similar to refuse fascism. Org at all

1953
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:39,200
Escalation of civil unrest in the provocation of hostile to say hostile

1954
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:45,088
Law enforcement

1955
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:02,496
Which is interesting in contact indicator

1956
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:04,288
Philosophy is built around

1957
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:06,080
They're coming for our women

1958
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:12,224
Well and more ironic evens it on inauguration weekend there were so many videos of him drunk

1959
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,272
Screaming

1960
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,368
Fixing that I noticed

1961
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,648
Is that his

1962
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:21,696
Interns language like that

1963
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,232
The things that he's describing of like

1964
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
This is house

1965
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,072
This is what they're saying

1966
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,352
It's all couch

1967
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:31,168
Military language

1968
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,984
That makes sense as military language

1969
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,008
Only watch

1970
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,032
Movies

1971
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,312
About military life

1972
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:41,152
Is all of this nonsense buzzwords

1973
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:46,016
2 News weather

1974
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,320
You're just

1975
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,112
You're just giving up the game

1976
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,392
This is all

1977
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,416
Fake bulshit

1978
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,208
Uat watch

1979
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:56,256
London Has Fallen

1980
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,632
Yeah

1981
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,728
So in this one more

1982
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:10,848
In this next clip Harrison gets to talking about another thing that you learn

1983
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,128
From reading these documents

1984
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,432
Little surprising

1985
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:16,480
Get off my plane

1986
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,016
Different

1987
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:18,784
Sorry

1988
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:25,440
The funding how they're paid

1989
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:28,256
On this guy who the documents belong to

1990
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,840
Which seems to be $26,000 for one person has one event

1991
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,424
That sounds right

1992
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,960
Consider that

1993
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,544
Thousand dollars

1994
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,176
For one person at one of them if you multiply 26

1995
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,712
Right

1996
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:49,504
You get $18

1997
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:50,784
I guess so

1998
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:54,112
Seems like seems like a dumb money

1999
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:56,928
Seems like a nouveau-riche

2000
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,744
Buying a couple boats

2001
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,280
Oh man

2002
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,840
6000

2003
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,864
Are you shiting me

2004
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:10,240
I mean I don't want to be involved in treason necessarily I don't be involved in that I want to do Mexican

2005
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,776
Terror

2006
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,544
In Spectre

2007
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:17,664
Oh okay it was all fake I take it

2008
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:24,064
Norah O'Donnell

2009
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,880
A billion next time

2010
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:30,464
Actually hit a brother up

2011
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,768
Need 26 Grand

2012
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
At that point

2013
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,632
Alex hears this

2014
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,656
He's like

2015
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,216
Alright that contract says 20

2016
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:41,984
6 G

2017
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,800
That is absurd

2018
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:48,640
Can't be like

2019
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,408
Come on man

2020
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:53,760
You've got a pivot a little bit the terms being like

2021
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,832
He decides to makeup ideas

2022
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,392
This guy's brother is

2023
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:01,952
Create

2024
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,000
Getting tire fixed

2025
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:05,024
Right must be

2026
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,560
Who created entire picture

2027
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,584
Turn around like

2028
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,400
Why he must be getting this amount of money

2029
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,472
Is this

2030
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:16,032
On the sheets

2031
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:21,152
You can even find these all I might post all the images of these on our website

2032
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:27,808
I don't know why I would though you can say I don't know why you can find him if you look for him there

2033
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
Level seven

2034
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:34,208
Which is super easy to fake

2035
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:37,792
To not be true Alex Jones decided this guy is level seven

2036
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:42,144
In terms of the organization as if that means

2037
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,960
He's a Mason he knows what that means

2038
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,496
So this next clip is in

2039
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,264
Entirely

2040
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,032
Jumped

2041
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:51,872
Fantasy scenario

2042
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:55,968
Must be just keep in mind

2043
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,528
This is Harrison and Alex Jones

2044
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,808
Just making stuff

2045
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:03,136
Jesus Squad

2046
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:09,792
Operator

2047
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,608
Are the operator level operator

2048
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,312
Actually have them of what they're involved in

2049
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:27,712
Only level 8 people.

2050
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,528
Secret codes

2051
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,808
Someone never end

2052
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:37,184
The taxes and all that stuff on there and it doesn't mean it handles it on

2053
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,512
Your

2054
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:41,536
It does preposterous

2055
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,560
What do you think

2056
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:44,608
Okay so this guy's level 7

2057
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:50,240
So that means he's below the adjutant how are the six

2058
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:54,336
Who are the six levels levels does it go higher

2059
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
20 levels

2060
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,480
It's probably it's probably indefinite

2061
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:05,856
Soros

2062
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:08,416
Level 69

2063
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:12,256
Finally got my five out of you

2064
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:17,632
Just the very idea that this guy's layabout loser brother who happens

2065
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,912
To just leave

2066
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,680
A

2067
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,472
Let's call it

2068
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,544
Treasonous lead damning document

2069
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,080
Laying around the house

2070
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,872
Happens to be level

2071
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:30,432
Like on the seventh level of this scam

2072
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:33,248
Sasquatch

2073
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,272
That's level seven

2074
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:38,880
Would be I can only think of maybe two levels beneath

2075
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,416
Logistic

2076
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,208
Well I mean level one

2077
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:50,656
Right like we're dumb dumb

2078
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,424
Do you have

2079
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,192
Killer crab

2080
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:54,240
Right like that's how that works right

2081
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,008
That's what I've heard

2082
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
Okay

2083
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:58,848
Level three is you join the Masonic Lodge

2084
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,872
Level four

2085
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,408
Is you leave the Masonic

2086
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:04,480
Level-5 is you go against your programming

2087
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,504
If you snitch

2088
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:09,088
Level 6 is you go against your

2089
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,624
Against your programming

2090
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
Against your stitches

2091
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,696
Right

2092
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:18,560
And then give him stitches level 7-Eleven

2093
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,864
Lucky Number Slevin actually

2094
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:24,960
I don't understand it I don't I don't think that there is room within

2095
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,264
Logistics

2096
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,056
Of the organization

2097
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:33,664
There is a bad for there to be literally Seven Levels

2098
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,200
Before

2099
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:41,344
A squad General in the

2100
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,232
I think so I think it would be for private Hugo and then others

2101
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,256
And then your gender

2102
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:52,864
Private

2103
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:57,216
Colonel or Colonel might be Colonel might be above General

2104
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,544
General you know what I'll be honest

2105
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,360
I know nothing about the military

2106
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:06,944
I know nothing about that organization

2107
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,992
Kernels and

2108
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:13,856
It's fine cuz we're making this up as we go along cuz so is Alex about

2109
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:24,096
Approved practices which

2110
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:25,376
Below the neck and above the belt

2111
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:32,288
Probably say props was just means weapons

2112
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:38,688
Not your food over it's all in there just following instructions not doing anything you know

2113
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,456
For themselves

2114
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:44,832
I guess he'll Alex's Alex's idea of

2115
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:46,880
What's going on is they just

2116
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:47,904
Like you get

2117
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:48,928
A plate of food

2118
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,792
Knock it over right because it's in your torso area and it's fine

2119
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:56,608
Middle

2120
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,912
I don't think it'll happen

2121
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:02,496
I've never seen you be assaulted Mark was literally ever

2122
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,264
Yeah

2123
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,824
I have no idea but

2124
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:09,152
I mean

2125
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:11,200
Probably more like

2126
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:18,880
So in the next one time and all the old ladies

2127
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:24,512
Joke is on level 7 you get the kit

2128
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,128
Music

2129
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:46,784
Who is that in the NBA it's too much of a motion to do right

2130
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,600
Punch somebody

2131
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:52,160
No one's the wiser

2132
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:53,952
How do you like a mule

2133
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:59,584

Every single piece of analysis of these documents

2136
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:13,408
There's nothing responsible about this

2137
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,432
It's it

2138
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,712
It's literally

2139
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:16,736
Alex Jones

2140
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:18,528
I can't be

2141
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:19,296
Clear about this

2142
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:22,112
The reason I started this episode with

2143
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,648
Episode like that thing

2144
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,952

Nah this is confirmed she doesn't matter

2150
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:48,224
Cuz I'm not level 7 but I can jump

2151
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,552
As it goes along your seeing him losing

2152
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:56,160
If this is true

2153
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:00,512
And now it's becoming more of course this is f****** true

2154
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,280
He's getting

2155
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,560
So in this next clip

2156
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:03,328
Alex Jones

2157
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,864
For the longest time

2158
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,144
His wondered

2159
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:09,216
Goldie's protest why doesn't anyone talk to me

2160
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:18,432
Got everyone drinks first

2161
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,832
First Take podcast history

2162
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,880
Took

2163
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,928
11 days

2164
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,232
So if he's wondering why

2165
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,256
Talk to me

2166
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,816
It's in the document

2167
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:40,448
What other operatic shopping

2168
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:46,848
Winning crowd

2169
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:50,432
Play acting

2170
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:54,272
If it works really good

2171
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,552
It's just obvious

2172
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,440
I watched so many videos of him out of protest

2173
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:04,768
Like I ordered his people out there and most of the time they're like

2174
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:11,680
Yeah but that Cindy a talk it's just people in like ski mask

2175
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,520
You have like an Owen Shroyer trying to get

2176
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:18,336
Start to break the line of those Shield Ray

2177
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,872
You suck

2178
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:26,272
Did they have shields or was it more like just like

2179
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,808
Little signs of dead

2180
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:33,184
No thank you no

2181
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:39,072
Then that smart

2182
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:41,888
This is way better

2183
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:45,984
But if we're going to talk about superheroes and the way it is

2184
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:46,752
Describe things

2185
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:47,776
I think

2186
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:49,824
Democratic socialists in ant

2187
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,104
Antifa

2188
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,664
Is like the Captain America

2189
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:56,224
We're about when you throw it

2190
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:04,672
It's not like Roman Reigns Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins

2191
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:09,536
Alexia

2192
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:12,864
I just think we should

2193
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:15,168
No thank you Owen Shroyer on them

2194
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:16,704

Like before the show like an hour and a half or so before the show I was watching

2196
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:23,104
The video cuz I wanted to figure out the truth

2197
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,384
About

2198
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,944
An hour and a half before the show

2199
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,760
Seven and a half hours ago give or take

2200
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,576
Because I'm trying to figure out that that narrative

2201
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:40,256
Someone putting a gun on until I watch the video of them

2202
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,304
Is David Knight was gay

2203
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,072
Commentary

2204
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:46,144

02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,936
Zoom

2206
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:50,752

Iblog

2232
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,200

Why people don't want to talk

2236
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:11,904
Alex Jones

2237
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:16,768

02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,816
A me so much that he's confused like

2239
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,864
These people want to talk to

2240
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,448
Fun I like

2241
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,496
I like a good time

2242
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,288
Pure personal insecurities

2243
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:34,688
No he thinks it's that liberals can't express their positions and they're all brainwashed Dum Dums

2244
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:41,088
Bentley like once you get he does all that stuff take a little personal

2245
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:44,672
If you build up a narrative of

2246
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,720
NBA

2247
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:47,488
People from

2248
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,512
Talking to you

2249
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:50,304
Paranoid

2250
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:53,376
Personal insecurities right

2251
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:58,496
It sure I mean it's like the

2252
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:00,288
That's the sad guy who has like a

2253
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,568
Conspiracy about why his

2254
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:04,128
Broke up with him

2255
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:09,760
Back to me

2256
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,064
Efferent mean that's still like

2257
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,856
The NBA keeps people from talking to

2258
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:15,392
Is still

2259
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:16,672
On some

2260
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,440
Mark

2261
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,464
More interesting

2262
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,024
It's less interesting to me then

2263
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,304
Nmda

2264
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,328
Keeps people

2265
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,352
From talking about

2266
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,632
Booking

2267
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,192
Trying to get martial law

2268
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:32,544
Write any f****** idiot real life

2269
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,080
Exposed

2270
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:38,176
Well do you know what the biggest issue in American history

2271
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:39,712
John Wilkes Booth

2272
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:40,736
Signed an NDA

2273
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:41,504
True

2274
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,552
Well known fact

2275
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:46,368
So it is next with Alex Jones County

2276
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,416
Kind of sucks it up

2277
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
Quesadilla

2278
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:52,000
Really really believe these documents

2279
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:58,656
More than 10 countries

2280
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:02,240
20

2281
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:07,104
Nazi war criminal

2282
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,432
The cops

2283
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:14,784
Address for

2284
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:20,160
Harrison other key points things we should recap

2285
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:24,256
Marshall Law three years ago back in 2015

2286
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,560
Which state is Obama

2287
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:30,400
What's funny

2288
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,288
Didn't work

2289
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:42,176
I don't feel pretty good about that as we all know America definitely stop

2290
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,272
I think we've all come

2291
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,040
Come to an agreement

2292
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:50,880
Trump has a 100% approval rating

2293
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:53,440
Can't we stop fighting with each other and we just

2294
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,464

2295
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,512

Prosper

2297
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:01,120

02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:16,480
Like this is going to see a

2305
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:20,832
Bad improv group like Second City first year

2306
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:21,600
Class

2307
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:22,624
Is like

2308
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,416
We're going to do a bar show to go

02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:25,952
Yeah they're like nah dude I'm out

2310
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:26,976
Okay

2311
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,024
Well

2312
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:34,400
It's good then we only have a few more Clips. They're only going to see gas and a few more time

2313
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:40,800
OK Google about as much

2314
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,080
Alex Jones

2315
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,104
Information from

2316
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:47,200
If it's true

2317
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,552
Get weird with a narrative

2318
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,088
It's time to pray

2319
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,904
He does not let the fourth hour host

2320
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
Get on air

2321
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,208
Who's going to host

2322
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:58,976
The 4th

2323
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,024
I don't know

2324
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:02,560
Because they don't get in

2325
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:06,400
I think it might have been Owen Shroyer and then he just does the the War Room

2326
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,680
I'm not entirely sure

2327
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,240
Alex Dixit out

2328
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:13,824
Cuz he is just f****** he's got a bee in his Bonnet here and he's going

2329
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,896
He says two things at the end of this episode that I think are like

2330
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,688
You're losing

2331
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,712
This is f***** up

2332
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:20,736
The first one

2333
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:26,624
The groups that are literally when they launched

2334
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:29,440
When we go out in the ocean start

2335
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:32,000
Each person supposed to shoot five cops tonight

2336
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:39,680
Alright fair enough

2337
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:42,240
So if I understand this correctly

2338
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:47,616
It's in it's in the contract you should five tops of night

2339
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,408
Also

2340
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,176
The cop

2341
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:53,248
Unions are in on this

2342
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,040
Absolutely

2343
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,320
It's nonsense

2344
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,368
Such nonsense

2345
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,464
Giving me information

2346
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:05,024
Okay all right

2347
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,072

Berkshire

2351
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:14,752
There's always an even number of antifa members

2352
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:17,824
Another one gets stabbed

2353
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,152
But you also have to kill

2354
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:23,712
An odd number of cops right right right

2355
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:25,504
So that you can always

2356
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,808
Have a prime number

2357
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:31,136

Responded

2384
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:03,552
This narrative

2385
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,320
He was spinning

2386
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:06,368
His idea that he had

2387
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:07,392
Prove

2388
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,952
Connection between Sora

02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:29,664

Tossed around

02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,832
No but you will get some weird

2398
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,880
Very clear race

2399
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:46,048
If your European Americans were aware of the number of black riot

2400
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,608
Tax dollars that breed black

2401

Soldier

2405
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:09,600
If these documents are legit Alex Soros and his daddy should be a green light

2406
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:11,136
To every Patriot in the nation

2407
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:14,464
Someone with more technical skills than I should organize a watch on both

2408
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:17,024
Disease so they don't leave it a moment's notice

2409
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:20,608
They can be found 24/7

2410
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:21,632
The tracking Soros

2411
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:24,448
Some patriot who has enough will utilize this info

2412
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,472
Right

2413
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,544
Citizen X

2414
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:34,944
Nothing will happen till summer when the climate is more African like in the Goombas can have their native elements

2415
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:41,344
I had a great time tonight it's time for me to go home here is a quote from

2416
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,648
Kimball the black love me

2417
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:50,304
The black woman a piss-poor excuse for a mayor the told those Riders to go out and eat some more was on Obama

2418
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,328
A payroll

2419
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:53,888
This was all designed to embarrass the Republicans as

2420
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,168
The country geared up for like

2421
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:00,032
Haven't too long here's an extra one is from not-so-new

Thanks for the documents I just loaded I just down

Downloaded and printed for my defense attorney in the event you want to test your dedication

2425
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,696
You're very stupid cause

2426
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:18,976
That's actually

2427
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,048
These documents

2428
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:28,448

Those pesky Jews

2432
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:42,272
Is a comment from

2433
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,184
In the midst of all of that vile

2434
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:50,464
There's the word

2435
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:56,864
Pesky like this is like this is a Scooby-Doo right right right

2436
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:58,144
Metalink

2437

02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:05,056
Howard Hughes a hero who comments

2441
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:09,920
Soros should have been Swinging From The Gallows a long time ago we all allowed to happen

Henry Strater

2444
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:20,160
Yeah there's no there's no there's no like a punctuation there

2445
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:25,536
So here is a comment from last of the Patriots

2446
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:29,632
If it happens again because of sorry-ass Soros and his clan

2447
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:34,496
Americans will United and capture any family scum of sorry-ass Toro

2448
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,520
They will be

2449
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:37,824
Tried by the people!

2450
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:43,200
They will be convicted by the people!!

2451
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:44,992
By the people all caps

2452
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:50,624
America America are getting very tired of the shenanigans going on in our country and we will

2453
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,952
All caps! And get these people

2454
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:57,536
Their time on Earth is getting shorter and each passing day

2455
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,376
None will exist

2456
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:02,144
Donkey

2457
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,424
I think

2458
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,984
The biggest thing that we're taking away from this

2459
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,264
Is that you and I

2460
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:09,568
Have more of an issue with their

2461
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:15,968
Grammar. Will Exist by the end of this year and America will be a great nation again 3

2462
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:19,296
Mission Point

2463
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,576
War is on the horizon

2464
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:26,464
Okay here's good boy good boy as a comment

2465
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:31,584
Will someone would someone please kill both soros's

2466
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:38,496
Here's a guy that's a very straightforward

2467
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:40,032
He is a pretentious douche

2468
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:41,056
I don't know who that is but

2469
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:42,080
Sounds like

2470
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:48,480
Freddie gray and Trayvon Martin were both know we're both cuz we're both completely

2471
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:52,064
Coco events when nobody died

2472
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,112
Going to

2473
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:55,392
Is it

2474
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:00,000
I just want you to know the reality of what people are

2475
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:03,072
I would everybody got understand

2476
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:05,120
The reason I'm bringing this up and

2477
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,192
But like

2478
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:09,984
The reason I'm

2479
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:15,104
I'm I'm doing that I want to bring that really into focus is that this is the response

2480
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:16,640
That people have

2481
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:19,968
That narratives that we just laughed about

2482
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:20,992
Right

2483
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:21,760
A good

2484
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:22,784
Hour-and-a-half

2485
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:24,320
And it's absurd

2486
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:27,904
There's no critical thinking skills being employed by the people who were listening

2487
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,952
Into the show their immediate response is

2488
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,232
Vitriol

2489
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:33,024
Anti-semitism

2490
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,792
Against blacks

2491
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:39,424
Again because

2492
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:41,728
We live in a world that is

2493
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:42,752
Post parrot

2494
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,544
Like that

2495
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:47,104
Is legitimately hilarious

2496
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:49,408
But people believe that

2497
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:55,552
Lego

2498
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:58,880
That wasn't real like if you were writing a

2499
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:04,000
Reactions

2500
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:09,376
Comments that I pulled clearly bought tonight

2501
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,144
Of course

2502
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:15,264
No it's just like it's just like it at you know as a comic I don't right

2503
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,032
Trump jokes

2504
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:16,800
Because there's

2505
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,336
What what

2506
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:23,712
What's the escalation that you can go right you know like this whole thing is beyond reality

2507
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:25,760
And listen to these comments is like

2508
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:27,296
That is

2509
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,344
Hilarious

2510
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:36,000
And in other people who believe that

2511
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:36,768
Comfrey

2512
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:38,816
What it takes

2513
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:42,400
6! Is okay

2514
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:46,240
What's the part of like that

2515
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:49,056
! part of tragedy that's

2516
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:53,152
Funny some level that is you have to kind of laugh

2517
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:58,272
We never deal with the idea of the comment section

2518
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:02,112
Site and I felt like this was an appropriate time to do that

2519
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:03,904
Because this is all

2520
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:09,536
Such b******* right and that's how these people

2521
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:10,816
This is not true

2522
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,096
Yeah it's all

2523
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,888
Either directed towards

2524
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:15,680
Anti-semitism

2525
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:21,056
Flash Soros needs to die Fred suck these black people they're so stupid

2526
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:26,688
Is it those are the two directions the end up going at the same time

2527
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:28,736
This is a weird

2528
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:31,808
Singing to I don't I don't

2529
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:32,832
Think this is

2530
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:34,880
It's so much as it is

2531
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,160
Like if you

2532
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,184
Watch AIDS

2533
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,976
Twitch stream of

2534
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:41,280
Video games

2535
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:45,376
Video game twitch stream like a very popular one

2536
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:50,496
Right you're going to find there's a lot of weird racist ass comment

2537
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:51,520
Thankfully not ours

2538
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:52,800
Because

2539
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:55,872
Like for some reason comments sections are a

2540
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:59,712
Nightmarish place for people who are

2541
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:00,992
Clearly damaged

2542
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:05,088
For them to express some sort of pain

2543
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,392
Yeah like I don't know what to

2544
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:10,720
To tell you but also at the same time

2545
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:11,488
You're letting

2546
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:12,256
Alex

2547
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:13,536
And his ilk off the

2548
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:19,936
The hook a little bit because they curate that I'm not the reason that we don't have people spewing

2549
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:21,472
97 Tesla race

2550
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:26,592
Watching the show live is awesome

2551
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:30,688
So I'm never going to not love that

2552
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,760
And

2553
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:35,296
This is why I'm glad

2554
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:37,600
That we waited a day

2555
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:40,160
To discuss this narrative cuz I would have loved it

2556
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:40,928
Discussed this yesterday

2557
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:43,232
Clearly

2558
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:44,000
You

2559
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:45,536
You really

2560
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:46,560
Hammered that thought

2561
02:19:48,096 --> 02:19:48,608
Zip

2562
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:49,632
I didn't

2563
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:50,912
Because

2564
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:54,496
On the 10th

2565
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:56,288
Yes Alex

2566
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:59,872
Was reporting irresponsibly because

2567
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:04,736
Still saying I believe this but not saying it's

2568
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:10,880
If it's true it would be damning

2569
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:12,928
Yes so you give it a day

2570
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:14,208
He's he's

2571
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,232
Couched it

2572
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:17,536
Union protectively you give it a day

2573
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:19,328
And the next day on the show

2574
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,656
There's literally no reason for him not to have a definitive answer

2575
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:24,960
Right because that's our research

2576
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:26,240
You could just Google it

2577
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:29,056
This seems to be the most important issue it would

2578
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,336
Clearly proved

2579
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,872
Some sort of domestic

2580
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:36,224
Terrorism being carried out by your biggest enemy you have the document

2581
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:37,760
He spent his whole show

2582
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:38,784
He's got

2583
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,320
All of this conversation

2584
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:42,368
Taken care of

2585
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,904
Important narratives that

2586
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,672
You could possibly

2587
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:46,976
Because this is me

2588
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:48,256
The end of the Republic

2589
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:51,072
Cuz we know absolutely

2590
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,376
All of your time if this is real

2591
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:55,680
I would agree with him you need to

2592
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:57,728
You spend all of your time fighting against

2593
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:59,008
It's the only thing to do

2594
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:00,032
Right

2595
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,824
I assume for the next

2596
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:02,848
6

2597
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:03,872
12 weeks

2598
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:05,920
He's going to do this every single day

2599
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:11,808
No he Treads water on the January 11th show for the first 58 minutes

2600
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:12,576
Saying

2601
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:13,856
Nothing of course

2602
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:14,624
There's nothing

2603
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:16,160
Victim narrative

2604
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:17,696
Victim b*******

2605
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:19,232
0 nothing

2606
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:21,280
Not even related to the doctor

2607
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:24,864
White people are under 58 minutes

2608
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:28,704
Assessment

2609
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:36,384
I remember that

2610
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:39,968
And I should have read the show

2611
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:42,016
Cam

2612
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:48,928
Obama plan to use for the Soros funding

2613
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:52,512
Race war

2614
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:54,048
Martial law

2615
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,120
Loretta

2616
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:59,680
Initiative

2617
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:06,336
So now he's presenting it as quickly as real

2618
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:07,616
He is just

2619
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:10,432
Nothing is not checked on it

2620
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:11,968
Because if he had

2621
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:13,248
What he would say is

2622
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:14,528
We reached out to them

2623
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,832
No comment from them at this time

2624
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:18,368
They wouldn't get back to us

2625
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:24,768
We reached out to the open societies and I do we read all the Alex Soros did not comment on this

2626
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:25,792
Any of those things

2627
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:31,936
Would be able be able to use them to his Advantage he doesn't do that he doesn't take all the steps

2628
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:38,336
You didn't do any of that he just comes on air and pretends it's f****** steak documents from 4-channel real

2629
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:43,968
He couches it the first day and then the next day is like there's an article up there and

2630
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:45,504
Any presented as if it's real

2631
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,552
Yeah now I thought that was

2632
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:49,856
I thought that was

2633
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:51,904
I had no idea

2634
02:22:52,416 --> 02:22:53,440
I thought you know

2635
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:55,488
Okay

2636
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:56,768
Alex is going to f******

2637
02:22:57,792 --> 02:23:02,144
Or whatever like we did this he's going to use it as a waypoint later

2638
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,936
Considering the situation

2639
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:05,728
Shouldn't have said that last clip

2640
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:07,264
But if he works

2641
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:12,896
Smart idea clip still works with pump

2642
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:19,552
Right if you can use it for like we always do you remember when the document

2643
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:20,832
Rhetoric

2644
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,112
Trying to remember that

2645
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:24,160
Remember how it was a fake hoax

2646
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,696
On Fortune

2647
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:30,560
You had a good day

2648
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:32,096
Now

2649
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,888
20 minutes later

2650
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:34,912
I realized

2651
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,704
But Alex Jones

2652
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,104
He might be

2653
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:45,664
He might be playing some angles

2654
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:46,688
Okay

2655
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:48,992
He might have been overdoing it

2656
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,016
Intentionally

2657
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,832
First of all because of that

2658
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:53,856
Missing out the boat

2659
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:54,624
On qanon

2660
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:56,672
And because he knew

2661
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:58,208
Who was going to be books

2662
02:23:58,464 --> 02:23:58,976
On the show the neck

2663
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:00,256
Oh no

2664
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:02,304
Sell me on this

2665
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:05,376
The next day

2666
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:06,912
January 11th

2667
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:08,960
2080

2668
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:11,776
Chuck Norris's son

2669
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:17,408
Sit back down

2670
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,688
Sit back down

2671
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:23,808
Sit back down

2672
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:25,856
Chuck Norris's son

2673
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:29,952
Who was the director of amerigeddon that Alex Jones is in

2674
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:34,304
Is on the show and Alex Jones knew that the day before

2675
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,096
Also Alex Jones

2676
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:38,144
Keep saying throughout the show

2677
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,192
Said he's trying to get Chuck on

2678
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:43,264
He's like a little bird told me Chuck might be coming on

2679
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:44,288
Play it later

2680
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,312
I'm so

2681
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:48,384
Listen

2682
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,152
To this

2683
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,456
Laming b*******

2684
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:54,528
Crossroads of Hunter Wyatt

2685
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:57,600
A near-future film of the second American Civil War

2686
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:00,416
A spiritual war

2687
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:14,496
Everything's fine art out there who

2688
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:19,360
The real quick just to give you some contacts

2689
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:21,920
All you need to know about this movie I watched

2690
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:24,736
The trailer all you need to know

2691
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:26,528
It's like

2692
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:28,064
A gun white family

2693
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,088
I was like

2694
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:30,880
Under Siege and they're really Christian

2695
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:32,928
And the bad guys mysteriously black

2696
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,464
Course

2697
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:41,888
Enchanting is got a grip on the town

2698
02:25:54,944 --> 02:26:01,088
Long time ago

2699
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:07,488
Enough

2700
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:13,888
If we close our eyes to what's going on

2701
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:26,688
Praying to kill but nothing compared to the battle vest

2702
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:39,488
We fight against spiritual wickedness in high places

2703
02:26:52,544 --> 02:26:58,688
1

2704
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:04,832
AAA

2705
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,368
So they spend

2706
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:12,256
40 minutes of the show trying to pimp this movie

2707
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:13,280
Biggest Venom

2708
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:14,816
Movie promo

2709
02:27:16,096 --> 02:27:17,376
F*** off

2710
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:19,168
Dammit

2711
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:20,960
Chris Hemsworth

2712
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:21,728
Pivot

2713
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:33,504
Who's two stages 2013 stages

2714
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:37,088
But then be part of it that I was discussing earlier about Alex Jones

2715
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:40,416
Really being pissed off that he missed the boat on the last internet hoax

2716
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:41,952
Is that in there too

2717
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:45,024
Lakers versus not wholly preparing the audience

2718
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,048
For this

2719
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:49,632
Chuck Norris's Son movie that he knows he pimping the next

2720
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:57,824
That a little bit cuz also spoiler alert that movie on DVDs being sold on infowars.com

2721
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,360
It's being sold on infowars.com

2722
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:03,712
I mean like he has a financial stake in it to a certain amount

2723
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:08,064
It's crazy it's crazy

2724
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:12,160
10 million dollars into night in donations by the end of January

2725
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:14,208
We will absolutely watch that movie

2726
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:17,280
I want the movie for free I shouldn't have said that

2727
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:18,816
Also like

2728
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:21,888
Somebody needs to watch this movie come on

2729
02:28:23,168 --> 02:28:24,704
And also when you're in the mid

2730
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,264
Stuff like this weird Patriot

2731
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:29,824
White identity

2732
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:32,384
Sort of world we live in now

2733
02:28:32,896 --> 02:28:33,920
A little f***

2734
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:36,480
Can clunky the name your antagonist

2735
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:39,040
Hunter Wild

2736
02:28:39,296 --> 02:28:45,440
A little on-the-nose

2737
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:51,072
That trailer people should watch it

2738
02:28:51,328 --> 02:28:55,680
Cuz there's weird spiritual b******* going on in it also like

2739
02:28:56,448 --> 02:28:59,008
Clearly allegorical for

2740
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:00,288
Being scared of

2741
02:29:00,544 --> 02:29:04,128
It's crazy

2742
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:05,664
I saw the movie

2743
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:07,456
I thought

2744
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:09,504
Three of those movies

2745
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:13,088
All the movie I need to see you ever seen left

2746
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:17,440
Also that that one drop in there this way out of place

2747
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:20,000
We shouldn't have been raptured

2748
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:25,632
That was my favorite that was why are you saying that why are you in

2749
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:32,288
Are you in the story that is were raptured right

2750
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:35,104
Maybe that character is delusional

2751
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:38,688
But it also

2752
02:29:38,944 --> 02:29:40,480
Character is in heaven

2753
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:45,600
No he's not an Oscar Wilde reference

2754
02:29:47,648 --> 02:29:48,672
They they don't even

2755
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:50,976
How to chat room.

2756
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:57,632
It's a it's a reference to those two words

2757
02:29:58,144 --> 02:29:59,168
Bobbing about being

2758
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:00,192
Ian Whyte

2759
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:01,728
Free

2760
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:07,616
To some extent that I knew that was coming

2761
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:09,152
The whole time

2762
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:14,784
But it's out of a bit at the same time I believe I believe wholeheartedly in.

2763
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:20,416
But Alex Jones operating system where he believed that the internet and all their scams

2764
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:21,696
And their hoaxes are working

2765
02:30:21,952 --> 02:30:22,464
Better than him

2766
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:26,048
Insecure and very pissed off about that

2767
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:28,864
2018

2768
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:31,168
When this drops

2769
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,216
You clearly f****** fake documents

2770
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:34,496
On Fortune

2771
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:36,544
He like I got a jump on this

2772
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:39,616
I got to jump on this and then on top of that

2773
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:40,640
He uses it

2774
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:41,664
To push

2775
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:42,432
Harder

2776
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:44,736
Chuck Norris's Son movie

2777
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:45,760
Also

2778
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:50,624
Norris's

2779
02:30:51,136 --> 02:30:51,648
Suns

2780
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:55,232
5 minute commercial on air

2781
02:30:55,488 --> 02:30:56,768
For Chuck Norris's new

2782
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:57,792
Brand of water

2783
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:01,632
The Water Horse

2784
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:08,544
Force apologize this is taking this long but

2785
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,312
Get through this

2786
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:10,848
Perfect Buntline Cheese's

2787
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:12,640
Price of tomatoes

2788
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:17,760
This is worse than an admin episode of Alex Jones

2789
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:22,112
To get to this ad pivot she doesn't talk about the documents at all

2790
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:23,136
The rest of the show

2791
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,672
That's it

2792
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:25,440
Well that's already

2793
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:28,768
Yeah it's crazy

2794
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:31,840
Time to let that Never Be Shaken never

2795
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:33,120
Be allowed off the hook

2796
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:34,912
But he can't

2797
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:37,216
You don't have to keep reminding him like

2798
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:39,264
They've already got trick by that b*******

2799
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:44,896
But unfortunately no one really cares all that much appreciate very much

2800
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:51,808
I'd like

2801
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:52,832
Auto automatic

2802
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:54,112
Alex Jones

2803
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:55,392
Career would be over

2804
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:56,672
I think Within

2805
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:59,488
Courts because of this sort of b*******

2806
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:02,560
Believing internet scams

2807
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:03,328
Hoaxes

2808
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:04,864
Probably going

2809
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:05,632
To continue

2810
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:07,680
I have to assume it's not going to

2811
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:17,920
Mission accomplished Banner Bhai

2812
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:21,504
Yeah so I assume whatever comes next will be worth

2813
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:24,064
But at least at the end of the day

2814
02:32:25,344 --> 02:32:26,624
Delightful in the in the

2815
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:29,952
And in terms of like what he advocated for

2816
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:31,488
The kill Soros and all but

2817
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,304
At least at the end of that episode he was just saying like

2818
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:40,704
A guy's a women go f*** democrats for info

2819
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:42,496
And horrible it's not like

2820
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:47,616
It's not violent I would rather super male Vitality on my burger then watch that

2821
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:55,808
Sunnyway Jordan Weaver website.com

2822
02:32:56,064 --> 02:33:02,208
I always do everything for a third party

2823
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:07,072
First issue that a third-party should have is

2824
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:07,840
And I

2825
02:33:08,096 --> 02:33:09,888
I think this is the most important issue that

2826
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:10,912
Is

2827
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:13,216
Unaddressed today is

2828
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:15,008
Equality for women

2829
02:33:15,264 --> 02:33:21,408
I think once we get there was over

2830
02:33:21,664 --> 02:33:23,456
With that

2831
02:33:23,712 --> 02:33:26,528
There is it like once we have equality for women

2832
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:27,552
I think there's such a

2833
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:28,320
Huge

2834
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,392
Deluge of things that will change

2835
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:34,464
Because of that and once you start having this conversation

2836
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:35,488

2837
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:38,816

02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:31,456

2870
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:32,992

2878
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,496
I think it's maybe the first time

2879
02:35:54,752 --> 02:35:55,264
And I think

2880
02:35:55,776 --> 02:35:56,288
Important

2881
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:57,824
