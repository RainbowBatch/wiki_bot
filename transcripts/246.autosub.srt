67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Which brings us to

68
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Basically our second

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,456
Officially doing this

70
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,784
Before we get to the episode I wanted to take a moment

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
I've been thinking about it

72
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
What my favorite

73
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
On the show

74
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Considered

75
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,000
Maybe for our New Year's Eve episode Witcher doing right now

76
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Maybe we do a clip show

77
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,631
Maybe

78
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,823
Second of all

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
Do we do the top 10

80
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Clips of Alex Jones

81
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
False

82
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,415
Uni sitting here listening to ourselves

83
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,815
I was taking a bath with other day I was thinking about

84
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
Like what was sticks out in my head as the best

85
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,239
Thing that we've uncovered on this show in 2018

86
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,359
I think I mean there's crime

87
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,967
Tragic story of

88
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,063
We learned that Alex Jones probably killed a guy

89
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
Which is

90
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Pig stuff

91
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
I wanted to actually have you come in with your favorite thing and I have my favorite things I forgot to tell you

92
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Going to give me

93
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,631
Comes up in your head certainly

94
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
I will say that the top thing for me is

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
Alex Jones

96
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,871
I re-watch that interview

97
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
Yeah that was great I forgot about this

98
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
Billares ask him where he found some like a docket like

99
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
Declassified information

100
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
History Channel

101
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,743
The most absurd thing ever and I think

102
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
That gets my title for best thing in 2018

103
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,655
On our show me recent Tobias

104
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,751
Because if my complete lack of any kind of memory

105
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
Man it's tough to beat a good vitamin the Apple filled life very fragile

106
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
Plus I want salad

107
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
What was there

108
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,671
Close to

109
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Yeah those are real strong but the reason

110
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
I meant to say I respect your choice but I'm staying with mine

111
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
Is that I understand that

112
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
Nothing is named the best are best

113
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
The Reason by choice

114
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Is better

115
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,711
Pittsburgh

116
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
In that interview Alex really demonstrates how he can't hang

117
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,135
Interview with someone who he's about four years

118
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
He has a guy there it's his chance to pin him down

119
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Eddie can't do it

120
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,351
Because all of the information that he's been saying about this guy for years is all lies

121
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
So it just fully demonstrate

122
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
That Alex

123
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Is

124
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
Full of s***

125
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Likee flounders

126
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
It's super embarrassing

127
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,759
Has some relevance to some of the stuff over today because it's another instance

128
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Alex

129
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
To the fire

130
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
But it's another instance of him just not being able to hang

131
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
It's like

132
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
You have put yourself

133
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
From the position of the guy you are Jordan

134
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Do not not you

135
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
Right there is

136
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
Steve Kerr's The Bel-Airs kukoc

137
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
Yeah but

138
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,511
Examples of it's like the buzzer is coming down

139
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
Bill Ayers domestic terrorist embarrassed

140
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Receive another instance of

141
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
The clock is winding Alex

142
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
Feet to the fire back to the wall

143
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
It's the bed I'm very excited about that

144
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,575
Over April 5th and 6th 2009

145
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
It's just

146
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
There's a lot

147
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,975
Start with an out-of-context drop

148
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
From today's episode

149
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
I would ask

150
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Check out yourself

151
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,727
Because the biggest problem

152
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
Mostest

153
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,223
Is speculation or rumors and on my site

154
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
I love that

155
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
I would like you guys to

156
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Who are listening to this

157
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Is

158
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,071
I would like you to investigate I want you to call these sources

159
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,423
I want you to find secondary sources and I want you to get quotes on the record

160
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,895
I mean he's trying to present it as like

161
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,223
Take my word for it like I'm some sort of LeVar Burton

162
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
Reading Rainbow.

163
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Panicked as well

164
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Reading Rainbow that's a boy

165
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,919
Rank speculation

166
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
So don't just believe me cuz I'm saying

167
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
If you don't come out looking good

168
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
And this episode

169
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
You come out looking

170
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
Particularly bad

171
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Now we're all the time

172
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,143
Here's the first.

173
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
Is there's been some bad stuff

174
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
That just happen

175
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Their bits of murder

176
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Alex

177
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
These murders

178
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Because they kind of

179
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Volcom

180
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
There have been a lot of horrible mass shooting people killing their old families

181
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Spoiled rotten

182
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
Because you couldn't learn to speak English fast enough went into the place where

183
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,815
Debowler

184
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Yesterday in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania

185
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
I wear this at Richard Andrew

186
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055

M-43

190
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
To come to his mommy's house where you live

191
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
It's always you guys live with Mommy

192
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
I mean I don't know what the deal is with him

193
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,975
Point is is that shot

194
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
Two of the cops is Mother Weidman to the house

195
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
And then

196
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,519
He waited for more common nnn shot three more killing another one of them

197
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,663
And the mainstream media has certainly enjoy tying me and let me tell you

198
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Raw Story

199
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and others

200
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
Because it's friends and family say that

201
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
You learned all submarines by the way

202
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,535
He warned of a plaintiff

203
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Application

204
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
And I'm attacked on the newspapers

205
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
He goes off in another folder

206
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,831
Not me talking about your revolves around

207
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
22 year old guy who killed cops before he was taken alive

208
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Coincidence

209
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
I assume the color of his skin had nothing to do with that I see no reason to believe he was he

210
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,007
Started to have a discussion about what motivated

211
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,383
His mom for telling him that he had to get rid of his dog because the dog

212
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
Peeing on the carpet they're always mad at

213
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
Started to get domestic violence they always call the police about this

214
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
Was the precipitated the shooting

215
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Richard's friend Edward perkovich

216
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,399
The idea that Obama was coming to take everyone's guns

217
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,007
A large team of a documentary released a month before the shoot

218
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Coincidence

219
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,199
Richard was a frequent poster on both Alex's Dyke front door he wants posted quote

220
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,831
The federal government mainstream media and banking system in the United States

221
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
Completely controlled by zionists interest

222
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
An economic collapse of the financial system is inevitable bring civil unrest if not outright

223
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Balkanization of a continental United States

224
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Sybil revolutionary racial War

225
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,495
This collapse is larger the engineered by the elite powers

226
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,823
B b in order to make up for a power and asset grab

227
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
Summer of Rage take the words do and Zionist out of there you got Alex to a f****** to eat

228
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Under his f******

229
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Whether or not that's actually the argument

230
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
Irrelevant

231
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Are entirely base

232
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
He's a Pez dispenser

233
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,863
He clearly believed all the things that Alex put into the world but Alex doesn't want to talk too much about this case

234
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
Really he just wants to deflect attention

235
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
That's not me

236
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
That's not me

237
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Because

238
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,103
Richard was motivated by everything that Alex

239
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
There's a little

240
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Wrinkle

241
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,015
Infowars forum

242
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
For being such players in the endgame many info Warriors are surprisingly unfamiliar with the Zionist

243
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
So

244
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,071
He was someone who clearly believes everything Alex was saying but felty wasn't hard enough on the Jews

245
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
This is the conversation Alex doesn't want to have

246
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,983
Because it very clearly illustrates how at least on some level

247
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
He's psychserves

248
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
The conduit towards people

249
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
Getting the message of Nazis

250
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
So you have this murderer

251
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
There's no reason to had to go that way seems like

252
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
I'd like the first time

253
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Starts talking about the

254
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
The shootings I was

255
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
God

256
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
That's awful

257
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
I should remember that

258
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
And I don't because

259
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Which shooting is it

260
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
And it's crazy because three cops were murdered

261
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
You don't remember don't remember

262
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
But they're still there still but

263
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,223
That should be a big moment for the 300 million people

264
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,551
What you're expressing is something that I feel so much when I go back

265
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Necessarily

266
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,719
Something that should be a national tragedy

267
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
Everybody should know about that

268
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,191
So was that one of the ones in the schools or was that one of the ones outside

269
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
The school cuz there's been hundreds of

270
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
It goes to show like that

271
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Feeling that Everyone likes to blame on Trump

272
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Has been pervasive in our society for

273
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Longer

274
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Trump

275
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Concerta

276
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Human

277
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Self-defense

278
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,095
What else is a joking about that she'll the pain of all of these things

279
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
You can't you can

280
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
Can't function

281
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
Yeah

282
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Vicky's going to blame Obama

283
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,199
And the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

284
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,063
And association with the shooting

285
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
The fatal shooting of three police

286
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
This is ridiculous they also attacked

287
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,023
Because we are delusional

288
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
You are descended

289
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
Kill some cops

290
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Barack Obama

291
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
That sounds right

292
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
I think that this also illustrate Alex's

293
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,735
Incapable or unwilling dealing with

294
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Horrible things

295
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Things that people who happened

296
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
A white pill

297
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,391
He thinks he's being hard on him but he lives with his mommy

298
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
These guys pathetic

299
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Winner winner

300
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
People

301
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
Three young Muslim girls walking to the pool supply store

302
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,991
Animals

303
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
Just want to be in the Marines

304
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
For coming to get it that's what happened

305
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
And right I mean that's a big angle that Alex

306
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
But it's all Lotus

307
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,959
Semi-automatic handguns and rifles

308
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
And a psychologically test all Americans own guns

309
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,359
And to have an attorney general who Lobby last year

310
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,175
Talk about Eric Holder

311
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Having

312
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
The lobby before The Supreme Court

313
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,207
Eric Holder didn't argue in front of the Supreme Court 2008

314
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
With a bunch of people

315
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
Doesn't necessarily protect

316
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
Individuals right to own firearms

317
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,751
Outside of a well-regulated militia

318
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
People make

319
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
About

320
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Tation of the second

321
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Directions

322
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,735
Decided Amicus brief with a bunch of people it wasn't like

323
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,575
Supreme Court Justice

324
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
But that's the image Alex wants

325
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,903
Mr. holder ghost

326
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Right

327
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
Earlier right there you heard Alex say

328
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Obama's trying to push

329
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
To have psychological

330
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Testing for guns

331
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,447
And only because I think this is a very this is very important

332
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
Here is Alex from his interview

333
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Patrick bet-david

334
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
In 2018

335
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
Saying what you think

336
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Good gun

337
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
Control

338
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,087
I believe in the 2nd Amendment added criminals or any guns regardless

339
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
But I do think with mental-health other issues

340
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
Background checks probably good if you

341
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,911
Call prescription right now you're taking Prozac whatever it is some of the medication list that we have

342
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,263
That is either for bipolar or whatever you know things that we just talked about

343
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,591
Those folks can't get a gun you're okay with that

344
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,199
Here's the thing 30% of women are on those drugs about 15% a minute

345
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
And it doesn't sound right

346
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
Don't act like

347
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
People that are on those drugs

348
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
When the insert says I can make it be a killer

349
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
They should be looked at

350
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,887
I think if somebody has been

351
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,727
And is almost drives this be a database and you shouldn't be able to fire

352
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:59,103
Alex's own definition of Alex Jones is a gun grabber

353
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Psychological

354
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Testing for it

355
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
If you are at your Aunt psychiatric medication there should be a list

356
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
9090

357
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
Need to cut through a lot of the bulshit

358
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Because what Alex Jones is doing

359
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
Is perpetuating

360
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
The exact

361
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Kind of fear

362
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
That made this guy end up shooting

363
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
He's going on Aaron blaming Obama

364
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Hotel

365
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,351
Cesaro all that stuff is actually really good of course people

366
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,191
Mental issues

367
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:00,543
He's just he's a monster.

368
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Is

369
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
When you boil it down his argument

370
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
Obama is coming for your guns

371
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
And that's what you get

372
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
You know if you told

373
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
You're going to get

374
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,976
Dead Cops also which suggested he's justified in a way

375
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
A little bit

376
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Perpetuate

377
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,912
I guess the idea that this guy who killed these cops

378
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Wasn't optional

379
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,288
You know the idea that he was afraid of Obama taking his gun

380
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
That was exactly that wasn't based on a propaganda narrative put out by the right-wing and now like Alex

381
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,672
He is actually justify these letters

382
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
Should be

383
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,816
He's mad that everybody is like

384
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Connect

385
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Because of the optic

386
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
Problem right

387
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,128
That is messed up you minimize it for exactly the other reason that you would expect

388
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,856
Copper cops

389
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,976
And it barely gets any news coverage they want to play that down

390
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Real quick I need to stop

391
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
Here because I listen

392
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
Do all of his shows

393
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
Haha

394
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Bring up

395
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
Illegal immigrants killing

396
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
I hate that I

397
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Keep saying illegal immigrants just because he

398
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
You keep saying right

399
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
Right

400
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
People aren't

401
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,504
He's presenting the idea that

402
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:51,904
He covers be stories frequently of undocumented immigrants killing cops and just doesn't

403
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
He doesn't

404
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
He's given himself some sort of like

405
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:01,120
A backstory of every other day I talked about an immigrant till in the car I don't want

406
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
And that's not

407
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,496
He is in this case

408
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,104
Because they don't want to get the police lobbies upset about the open borders

409
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
Sure California where the tent cities are

410
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,552
They coming to take people's children they take their winnebago's of the insurance is down

411
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Point of order

412
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,768
Robbed

413
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,120
Undocumented immigrant Mexican

414
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
You got to leave those immigrants

415
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,152
Hey teacher leave those

416
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
Mnm cops or even below

417
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,880
1 cops killed by illegals

418
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
But also it's big national news

419
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,424
That guy's reading habits and what he was reading

420
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
So he's real defensive about that

421
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Because

422
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,336
On some level whether realizes

423
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
He's a propaganda outlet that is

424
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,944
Doing exactly what he insist

425
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,016
Everyone else is doing and this is one of the unfortunate

426
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
This isn't it

427
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
Inevitable

428
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
Yep that some people will respond

429
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Do you know whether it's by

430
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
By virtue of Tristram sort of chemical imbalance

431
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
Experience

432
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
Incorrectly or whatever

433
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Because of

434
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
The fears that

435
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,152
You create now in the same way is that like you get it you make a shotty seatbelt

436
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:55,552
Hundred thousand people will die but six million

437
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
These companies do that

438
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Send whatever

439
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
Does the same thing which is like

440
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
This rhetoric is super dangerous

441
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
And a bunch of people are going to hurt other

442
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
But the rest of them that don't are going to give me money

443
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
I think that's what he has to do

444
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,664
Setting aside money for the legal funds for the people that they're killing as opposed to

445
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
Fixing the problem they're doing that mass of like

446
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,576
Well it cost us this much to settle a massive loss

447
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
As opposed to a process this much to actually not

448
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Kill 1000

449
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:39,072
And as a corollary the same thing is true

450
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
It's more profitable to run that risk exactly whenever these instances happen

451
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
Might as well

452
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,248
The one that blew up

453
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
That is true

454
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,672
Clips

455
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Yeah I'm watching these young listen

456
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Watching these episodes I'm taking notes

457
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
This is one of the only times

458
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Go look at my notebooks

459
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
There's an hour

460
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
Not good

461
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Alex starts taking

462
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
Call

463
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Probably the most

464
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
Sing f****** call I've ever heard on his show

465
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
Talk to Mark and New York Mark welcome

466
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,696
I'll try you doing I just want to thank you I picked up a short way that's how I ran into you

467
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
And then I picked up

468
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
The Obama Deception

469
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
I cried most of the way through it

470
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,704
But when I saw your face I saw two things Alexei so emanuar man's man

471
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
And I saw a father

472
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
So I can tell you

473
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
What was Sean Hannity's and everybody else I don't know what they think when they look in her mirror at night before they put their kids to bed

474
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,296
But at least Alex Jones cuz she's not only a man he's also a father

475
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,368
Oh God oh God

476
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:17,632
Know how to emotionally connect with Eddie

477
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,472
You said maybe build up this massive emotional wall of life

478
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
You cried during the Obama I don't have no no no no no no

479
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,480
Why is your first thought

480
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,576
You got to call your work some s*** out or you got a like

481
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Deal with the fact that your ex-wife has your kids

482
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:49,376
You f***** up is not what I would have more and Alex's icon

483
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:55,776
Exactly the same thing

484
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,616
Over again because the words not making much then

485
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,016
And that's proof

486
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
You know I saw your film and ice

487
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,112
Cried through it and I thought there's a man

488
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
And like you said the same thing over again

489
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:19,328
This is trouble I want a documentary

490
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,728
Market New York

491
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,776
Trying to take anybody's

492
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
What okay

493
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
So we watch

494
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
The Obama Justice

495
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
What

496
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,576
Would make you cry

497
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,000
Also consider multiple

498
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Focus documentary

499
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
No

500
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
No

501
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
So he's eight

502
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
Crying on new stuff all the time

503
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
I can't imagine that being your response to it I could understand

504
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
Through it I was Furious

505
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,504
Wanted

506
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Nothing like that I would ever understand

507
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Ryan

508
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,720
The country must be that

509
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:24,352
Black people

510
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,704
I don't know if you responded really when I told you that I cried through a lot of

511
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Review Andy Daly

512
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,824
Review like you thought that was that was a little bit weird

513
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
I don't think I had timing I guess in retrospect now I disagree with my whatever okay

514
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
You experience

515
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
Incredibles

516
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah there's a tragedy connect

517
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
What could be

518
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,976
Of the character of forest

519
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
Right I think they're possibly like

520
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
The Warped version of that

521
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:04,032
Experience Alex as the narrator of that documentary the guy who

522
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
Trying his hardest in a tragic exotic struggle against

523
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Triggers

524
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,784
Emotion

525
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184
Now that you bring it up there isn't a little bit of a parallel

526
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Go between

527
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:29,120
Andy Daly and review and Alex Jones Show

528
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,984
Destroy all personal relationships in

529
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,056
Service of the show the image of like

530
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,872
They're being a point where they could have been saved

531
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
Gotten a divorce for the show that your life would have been completely same with Alex it's like maybe if you hadn't joined Trump

532
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
Maybe if you hadn't gotten involved and the river

533
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
Never ending cycle

534
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,400
That up but if you

535
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Then you know what

536
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,800
Yeah you you're still divorced but look at how much better everything is okay no you didn't do that

537
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
Alright if you stopped

538
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
With the Sandy Hooks

539
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
You're seeing you could have changed things you could have gone if you'd never met all these

540
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Yeah it's kind of Alex's kind of like a

541
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,648
Emotionally interesting Dumber version

542
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
But it's equal a psychopath

543
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Yeah

544
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Noah

545
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Anyway

546
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Whatever you think

547
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,984
So that's the end of the fifth that's all we're going to cover their

548
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
We move on to the sticks

549
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
My friend

550
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Is

551
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
What I

552
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
This to me

553
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,224
Is exactly why we play the game

554
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,296
Yeah we we find like

555
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,136
All of this is worth my neck report stuff comes right

556
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
This is equally exciting

557
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,536
Because

558
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,888
Your minute fishing trip Alex had to cancel

559
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,312
Spoiler alert

560
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,200
At a time

561
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
To cover Glenn Beck

562
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,064
Forthcoming debunking a FEMA camp

563
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
And so

564
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
April 6th

565
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Is it Monday

566
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,208
That's the day that going back is going to be

567
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
FEMA camp

568
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:37,888
He's run out of time to create a video so he has to do it live on air

569
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Right Alex has the ball

570
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
He's open

571
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
You know it's just on you

572
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
Get the ball in the hole

573
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
You've been talkin about FEMA camps

574
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,856
Entire f****** career

575
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
All you have to do

576
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,952
Is coherently make your point

577
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,000
And you have won the basketball game

578
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,096
That is all and I have no idea why I thought

579
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
Tragic embarrassed

580
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,824
But it's even worse than I thought

581
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
I thought it could be I thought there was a chance

582
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,688
Stumble and fall in like

583
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
Or just save eggs dolphin

584
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
He's him just rambling about nothing and sayings

585
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,584
Number of specific instances of things

586
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,984
And they're all pathetic

587
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Put up

588
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:53,408
Yeah but you could just be a dick to Glenn Beck and call it a day

589
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
I wash it

590
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,552
Something with lunatic I'm sure he was

591
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:06,208
F****** stupid about it too it was pretty little bit further down the road but

592
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Lamest thing

593
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
My life

594
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
We'll start the episode

595
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
And Alex is going to

596
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Introduce

597
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
He's about to do

598
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
So he has to do it today it's not like I'm going to do this

599
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,720
Almost is using language that indicate I don't

600
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,864
But I also know that if everyone's going to speak

601
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,960
Need ground to Glenn Beck

602
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,032
I can't let that happen.

603
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
After you can't

604
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,664
I'm pretty sure actually Alex does have mold

605
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,992
Glenn Beck's

606
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
Predictions about what

607
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
No way.

608
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:16,096
Based on

609
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
The possibility

610
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
That a mole at Fox News

611
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Has told him what Glenn Beck's

612
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
Because like

613
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
He does make

614
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
I stuck an absurdly specific

615
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
Prediction about him

616
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
A Amtrak station

617
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:46,048
It is one of the like popular internet videos

618
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,936
So for him to specifically latch on to that one so strongly

619
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Leads me to believe that he hadn't

620
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,384
Whatever I want Market New York

621
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,456
Internecine Bowl between the two

622
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,016
Bishop campsite

623
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
Glenn Beck Kobe also

624
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,184
That's why you sending over all these things

625
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,792
Glenn Beck's not a man or a father

626
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
That's right but that's

627
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,472
Glenn Beck

628
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,800
So is that first clip I think we saw

629
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Market

630
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:36,736
Get Wellmark marks 2019 Geo year

631
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Marksman

632
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,440
Using there I think very clearly in

633
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Cape a sense of

634
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
I have to do

635
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
And I think that carries

636
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
Next

637
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
He starts

638
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,448
Immediately making excuses for why it's not going to be that great

639
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,008
So they're in there right now

640
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,616
He's talking about his producer

641
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,040
So they're in a race

642
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:16,928
Miami Herald

643
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,560
Fridge training compass

644
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
You said a couple things that were kind of

645
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Miami Herald Argus

646
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,616
Riedel not specific enough

647
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:42,016
Do you do is go through the database of every article that the Miami Herald

648
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,624
Lord knows

649
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
I do know that you do want to do that that's

650
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
That the scary things

651
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,096
First of all because I am a hundred percent sure

652
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
He is like

653
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,960
Look they're going to do it a lot in there

654
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,056
There's hundreds of things you have to do whatever we end up doing here

655
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:10,176
Shut up I had to go fishing

656
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
And then the second

657
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
Something is Isaac

658
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
A shifting of the goalposts

659
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
Cuz he starts talking about troops on the street

660
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
And stuff like that confiscating guns

661
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Stuff like that

662
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
That's not the future

663
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,536
Can't stop I know that Alex likes to pretend that all of this is connected

664
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,096
But that's not the conversation to Glenn Beck

665
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,144
It has nothing to do with it

666
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,216
Debunking this is a moving of the goalposts

667
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
You artificially run-up

668
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
Is score going to make it look like

669
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
I'm making points

670
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Make a point about

671
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,968
Troops doing exercises all that stuff

672
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,760
It's even more overwhelming

673
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
Mike stuff about his

674
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Camp stuff

675
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
So it's it's

676
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
It's ludicrous.

677
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
The day before this

678
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,256
He was rightly pilloried for

679
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:03,168
Being a man to murder the troops on the streets

680
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
Narrative

681
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,056
Keep in mind before

682
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
There's a method to my madness

683
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Cuz there's there's a reason I kept

684
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,016
What he ends up doing on this show is telling people to kill cops

685
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,112
You bet

686
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,696
Very least like

687
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,584
It is what inspired this guy to be a nurse position where you

688
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,984
Doesn't matter why

689
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,336
Well you have to exercise your second amendment includes

690
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,384
You can also kill cops if they come

691
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,456
Further well-regulated militia or whatever

692
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
But he's not going to

693
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
He's going to complain about Robert Reich

694
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488
Labor secretary Robert Reich

695
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
Maxwell quotes

696
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
He didn't say that

697
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:17,152
Even if he did say that that does not relate to socialism

698
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
And then

699
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,088
That doesn't make sense

700
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,904
Let's

701
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,280
Youth race targeting that's not socialist that's what's it called

702
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
American

703
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,192
Robert Reich had a comet

704
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
We don't want it to all go to

705
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Construction worker

706
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,824
Yeah that was it you were talking about how their needs

707
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Not

708
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Just

709
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,296
White Construction 10 he didn't come out and say

710
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
You didn't say that

711
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,120
Don't know why this quote

712
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,448
Me a quote so quote literally no one said that

713
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
He said quote

714
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
Look up

715
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,568
I would love to say but I still will

716
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,200
No

717
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
To misquote somebody

718
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,320
Much more oppressed

719
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:37,280
Or if they were going for some sort of ghoulish Overkill like advocating for wet

720
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,584
When that might be

721
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
Just so you know our donations

722
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
For next year all go to none

723
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,616
Bright

724
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
So in this next clip Alex

725
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
You already sucked out this idea

726
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:00,063
The exact same thing that reads

727
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
Do this guy in Pittsburgh killing three cop

728
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
He doubled down on it

729
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
Voting

730
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,447
Automatic

731
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,799
For a complete

732
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,359
State senator Illinois

733
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,175
Direct General last year

734
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
Justice department

735
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,087
Attorney General

736
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
Supreme Court

737
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Shot shotgun or handgun

738
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
No firearms

739
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,239
. only police and military

740
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
Right now

741
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,103
It's in Supreme Court website

742
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,991
Read all of it but I read enough

743
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,551
To know the reality

744
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Yeah

745
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,135
Disregards back today

746
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Suicide signs

747
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,559
Eric Holder was a deputy attorney

748
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
General until 2000

749
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
He wasn't

750
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
At the time

751
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,775
Like the. Of time

752
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
No

753
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
No

754
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Versatile

755
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,503
Was going on he was working in private practice

756
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,879
Because easy was

757
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
News from d.c.

758
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
There was a

759
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,023
Right

760
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,911
Yeah absolutely

761
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
He wasn't it

762
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
General at the time

763
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
At all

764
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
Alex is mixing

765
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,103
All this time lineup in

766
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,431
XYZ they're all coming to take your guns

767
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
So it's all hot

768
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
The reason

769
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
Is still

770
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
You still Fair

771
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
Myself and Glenn Beck

772
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,519
My Media Matters run by Mr Brock of former neocon

773
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,919
Long story and of course

774
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,879
But in the same ways that rage filled Achilles

775
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
Is an epithet that runs through

776
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
The

777
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:50,815
Yeah everytime almost every time

778
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,863
The epithet rage-filled Achilles

779
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,263
Is in its very right

780
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,639
I read it but most of the characters in epithets along with them

781
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,735
Characterizing their characters

782
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Modern times

783
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
Whenever

784
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,343
Talk about Media Matters

785
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
He says

786
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
Soros and Media Matters

787
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:22,559
Soros-funded Media Matters

788
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,655
Neocon

789
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,447
And also

790
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:33,823
Knows Larry Nichols from those days

791
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Issue

792
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
For me is that

793
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
Bring up Media Matters

794
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Without bring up Sora

795
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
The idea that he had been

796
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,159
Like starting to bring up the roast a little bit right but not still not a big bad guy

797
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,255
It makes me think that we might have read a little bit more into that then there was

798
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
Vicky has no

799
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:02,239
Targeting of Soros yet

800
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Defunded thing

801
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:14,527
Alright be supported responded

802
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
Bright

803
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
That's super in

804
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
Obama

805
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447
Eric Holder for the shooting

806
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
I think it's even like

807
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Amatis

808
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
He blames the Pooh

809
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:45,759
Was Mister Rogers from Mister Rogers

810
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:49,343
Neighborhood

811
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Looking for

812
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,911
Material material material

813
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,543
Try to bolster their whole world

814
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
Going to get a lot of cops killed

815
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:17,759
Give the police implement the cops are pulling

816
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:25,695
They're going to

817
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
Oh my God

818
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,607
Did you just understand black people in America

819
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
The most important

820
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
I don't

821
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,007
I don't want to go too far down that road put it it

822
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,823
You just said it a very interesting point

823
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
I don't want to go

824
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,503
Too far down that road

825
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,063
You're still stupid

826
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,415
What is advocating

827
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,439
I guess the position

828
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,839
Self

829
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,399
Going

830
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,639
In my research about all these other weird things

831
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,991
I found that there is a improv quartet

832
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
Musical quartet

833
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:28,671
In the Austin area

834
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Police chief

835
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,999
RAC take out I thought that was really funny

836
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:38,655
I wish there was a baby

837
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,471
Fusion quartet door whatever

838
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,263
Miac worldview

839
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
If you are the Pentatonix

840
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,383
Change your name to Maya

841
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Your garbage

842
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
In this case

843
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
So specific

844
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,831
Those cops are responding to a domestic disturbance that this guy was responsible

845
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
Before he was the one who

846
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
The person who is wrong

847
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,975
There's no evidence that they did anything

848
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
Wrong in this situation

849
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
The shooting

850
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
To happen

851
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
So for Alex

852
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
Using

853
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
This sort of rhetoric

854
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
It legitimately is to

855
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,055
Blame the victim of murder for the actions of the murderer

856
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:23,455
Well I understand it's not it's not the first time but

857
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,991
That's not cool

858
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:30,111
No I don't want to be here defending cops or anything like that but

859
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,511
Defending them as murder victim has nothing to do with

860
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:44,191
Is David Auntie cop goes I'm on your team but I'm still not like

861
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,775
Let's murder indiscriminate

862
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,431
Almost certainly he would have

863
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,247
Beat her up or killed her like that is

864
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:02,879
I know we can't like fantasy book what if it's all if this then that

865
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
Yeah history or whatever

866
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
But you look at through this person

867
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,743
With this track record

868
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
He was doing that

869
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
There's a really good chance he would have caused

870
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Terrible

871
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
She did the thing

872
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Protect yourself that you could

873
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,335
It's a horrible thing of the only person to blame is

874
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
The guy who did it

875
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Yep

876
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,175
The further conversation is

877
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
The places where he was getting his in

878
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Information

879
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
Let him to

880
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
You could also blame all women for sometimes

881
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,207
See now this is what I was hoping to get you

882
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:46,911
It's women for sometimes being mean to taking us two years but finally working here

883
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
You got to stop being a little bit

884
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:05,343
Close to the real argument

885
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,695
Exactly

886
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
If we just had a gun ban on like

887
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,911
People who have been suspected of domestic violence or have had the cops called on them for domestic violence

888
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Dispute

889
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,799
Murders we go way way down really would

890
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,615
The last two years of like mass shooting

891
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:33,503
Really horrifying because the numbers don't tell story

892
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
But if you look at their website

893
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
You can go to the

894
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
Like spreadsheets

895
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,695
Local news reports

896
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,487
About you

897
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,023
You go to them and

898
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,863
Hear the stories of what they are your hundred percent right

899
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
Like almost all of the

900
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
People

901
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,007
But it's a drastic

902
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
Majority of that

903
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,895
Violence

904
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
In that area

905
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
If Alex Jones

906
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
Preserving

907
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
The Second Amendment

908
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
All that

909
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,439
Interested in cata unnecessary gun murders

910
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
That is the one

911
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
Should be in favor of

912
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
F****** never talks about it

913
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,935
And it shows just give a s***

914
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,775
Even for the NRA or anything like that

915
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,383
Like if you're really smart

916
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
Because right

917
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,735
Which is there really smart

918
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
As far as that

919
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,087
You got credit for being monsters through and through

920
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
Because they haven't

921
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
Nothing

922
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,303
There's no real like meaningful legislation about control

923
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
Acceptance that maybe we shouldn't have bump stocks around and it's like

924
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
In the first

925
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,847
You read the articles about that bump stock ban most

926
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
Gun sales people

927
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:11,295
We don't really sell many of these anyway they're horrible for accuracy it's almost pointless product

928
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,087
Almost like their existence is

929
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
Purely to murder

930
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
Debate

931
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
Symbolic

932
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,839
Control thing more than

933
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Anyway

934
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
We're getting too far off track

935
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,287
He does not give us

936
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,103
And if you did there will be other things that you would

937
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,639
Which suggested possible

938
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
Cuz he's even denying that there is a problem

939
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
He's denying

940
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
The reality of the

941
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,111
Situation at all

942
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
Deny the facts

943
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,951
This guy was inspired by who

944
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
Q word right

945
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,071
Basically like

946
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
And Alex Watts

947
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,911
Nothing to do with that

948
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,543
F****** fishing with his kids

949
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,663
Really f****** drive in 50 minutes

950
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
The episode

951
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
Alex gets

952
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:19,391
He has Max Keiser coming on for the last hour of the show

953
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,183
Has a good hour and a half

954
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
To do his debunked

955
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
Already complained

956
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
There's too much information

957
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,351
I don't know how I'm going to do this

958
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
Too much information

959
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
I'll tell you how it for as long as nothing for them in the show

960
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
Max Keiser about his fake currency for the last hour

961
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,247
Here is the

962
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,271
Alex

963
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
Japanese toe

964
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,319
Into talking

965
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
Wrong Glenn Beck

966
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:57,535
100 news articles

967
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:04,959
Because I can

968
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,271
Will do

969
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
He starts us

970
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,831
50 minutes

971
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Let's hear

972
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,927
Actually starts the hour and 20 minutes

973
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,487
Broadcast

974
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,407
Supporters are dangerous

975
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Regardless

976
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,583
We're going to expose you understand

977
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:12,031
Eclipse and news articles

978
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,591
Point of order could have had a production meeting

979
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,127
Alex Jones has

980
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Limited

981
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:20,991
No one is controlling anything he does

982
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,271
In terms of like

983
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:28,671
He had a show some of that could have covered the material could have done the first hour of the

984
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
Bump Max Keiser

985
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
Doesn't f****** matter next Kaiser would still come next week or whatever come on next

986
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:42,495
Kaiser's happy to be there

987
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
That's irrelevant

988
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,799
Outside internet

989
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
And one of the reasons

990
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Is there something

991
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
Does a bunch

992
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
At this period of

993
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Career

994
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
He goes into

995
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
Overdrive

996
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Is the term

997
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
Overdrive do not know what that

998
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Very frequent

999
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,927
And that is when his show

1000
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,999
Cheats for the radio

1001
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,559
He broadcast on his own website

1002
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:11,679
He has the infrastructure

1003
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
Few more calls another hour I know where

1004
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
Remembers

1005
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,759
All that she has run

1006
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
Limited time

1007
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Information

1008
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
To get out there

1009
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,927
Preemptively making excuse

1010
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,767
Is it going to be

1011
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,839
Now I want to say this very f****** clearly

1012
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,911
If you only have time to get it to 10%

1013
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,215
You better get into the best 10

1014
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:49,055
10% I don't understand why

1015
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:00,319
Go fuc yourself in like I can do an hour

1016
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,343
Which is 60 minutes

1017
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
10% of that

1018
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
6 minutes

1019
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,439
Perhaps the Showcase

1020
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:12,351
I'm just going to have Hazard leeches what material I do

1021
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
Time to get into the goods

1022
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:20,031
Stop Dan if you want to hear my better material go somewhere else

1023
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
To go this is Alex

1024
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
Doing his big Markie

1025
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
About

1026
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,199
This is it

1027
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,503
And it would end if he did it

1028
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,295
Look he does have OverDrive

1029
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:37,695
He can go on his own show

1030
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:39,999
Tents

1031
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:47,423
Read out all the documents implications the

1032
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,471
The name the name

1033
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,799
Devastating

1034
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,847
Revolution

1035
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,919
Unfortunately none of it is

1036
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:04,063
10:25 making excuses

1037
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
Alex finally gets to

1038
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,183
The big FEMA camp debunking

1039
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
End.

1040
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
This starts out

1041
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Bad

1042
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,911
Hour and 30 minutes

1043
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:25,311
How is controlled by the National Security Council

1044
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,407
Okay I already got to stop you

1045
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:38,879
On like a technicality because FEMA is Under the Umbrella of the Department of home

1046
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Homeland Security

1047
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Stretch

1048
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
There are a ton of organization

1049
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
The fall under the heading of national

1050
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Bearded Barber

1051
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,631
Because their role is obviously a

1052
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:56,031
You know it involves National Security there's a ton of place departments like immigration

1053
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Services

1054
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,847
Coastguard Customs Enforcement

1055
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,895
All of that is under the heading of

1056
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,919
Department of National

1057
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,247
The department oversees preparedness for responding

1058
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Natural

1059
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
Natural birth

1060
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,879
Is absolutely something that belongs in the Department of National Security

1061
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Housing it anywhere else

1062
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,951
Would be a bureaucratic

1063
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Mistake

1064
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
The problem is

1065
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,839
The National Security Council is not the Department of National City

1066
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:25,983
The president's National Security advisor is a regular attendee of the National Security Council meetings

1067
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,591
But it's not considered to be an essential player in the council

1068
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Cancel

1069
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,663
Is made up of members

1070
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:37,247
Like the president presidents

1071
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
Treasury

1072
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,319
The National Intelligence advisor of the chairman of the

1073
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,159
A regular attempt but not remember

1074
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:48,255
The Department of National Security as hell because they're under 6

1075
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,887
Department of National Security is headed by the Secretary of Homeland Security

1076
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,959
Who is not a statutory member of the National Security Council

1077
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,751
It does is not required

1078
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
These are two

1079
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:06,943
Different things

1080
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,295
Or your your argument with Alex right now

1081
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:17,695
By saying is controlled by the National Security Council it's not it's in the neck

1082
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Department of Nash

1083
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
Which are

1084
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,583
Similar but not the same thing

1085
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Razee

1086
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
It is

1087
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,167
Crazy that he doesn't understand the

1088
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,727
I cannot see why you were so excited

1089
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,823
Go fuc yourself

1090
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,663
You you you just had your Michael Jordan slam dunk moments

1091
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:42,783
And it's only going to get worse from here if the shot on Ehlo

1092
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
Scored on the opposite rim

1093
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:48,671
Accidentally scored for the Cavs

1094
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
Like this

1095
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
Beginning part

1096
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,351
First of all

1097
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,143
Is even more poorly

1098
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:03,775
Council controls

1099
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,103
Presidential

1100
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,919
The one on the right

1101
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:14,783
America

1102
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,647
And the courts are ceremonial under the present so they use cotton

1103
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,439
As a way to basically shut up

1104
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,791
He's talking about the

1105
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,607
He won the presidential

1106
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Directive

1107
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
51

1108
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,215
He's using that to argue I've heard him argue this

1109
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
FEMA under the Nash

1110
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Council

1111
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,895
And that it makes everyone slaves and makes the Congress ceremony

1112
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,223
None of this is

1113
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:48,063
Department of Homeland Security

1114
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:53,183
Like 1000

1115
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
Before that

1116
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,255
Responsibilities are handled by Hud

1117
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:00,095
In the seventies as a solitary

1118
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
Independent agency

1119
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,423
Before that another run by chud's

1120
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
Chard

1121
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Cannibalistic

1122
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
Humanoid Underground

1123
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
P-51 presidential

1124
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:15,455
Decisions directive 51 also known as the National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive

1125
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Until May

1126
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Fourth 22007

1127
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,551
I had literally nothing

1128
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,111
It has to do with continuity plans

1129
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Catastrophic

1130
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
Emergency

1131
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
And largely deals with the national

1132
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,511
Is very different from

1133
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Department of Homeland

1134
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,215
Gymnastics

1135
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,031
Yeah it makes it just

1136
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,359
It just rolls off the tongue the right way near like probably

1137
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:49,503
Talking about how power is

1138
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,551
In retrospect

1139
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
You know

1140
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,975
We're living now with Trump as President should retract all of his open

1141
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,191
Is president said stuff like that the groundwork

1142
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,823
So the idea that Homeland Security

1143
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,199
I'm sorry

1144
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,783
51 of course

1145
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,855
The document specifically says inspection to

1146
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:29,183
The goal is coming up with a framework for

1147
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
National government

1148
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,231
Find a quote

1149
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,303
A Cooperative effort among Executives legislative

1150
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
Judicial branches

1151
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
The Federal

1152
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
My coordinates

1153
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
As a matter of Comedy

1154
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,423
Disrespect

1155
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,215
Do the legislative and judicial branches

1156
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,495
And with proper respect

1157
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
For the Constitutional separation

1158
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
Anna Powers among the branches

1159
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,591
To preserve the concert

1160
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,383
No framework under which the nation

1161
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,943
Capabilities

1162
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,967
Three branches of government

1163
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,991
To execute constant

1164
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
Responsibility

1165
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,831
And provide for orderly succession

1166
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,623
Appropriate transition of leadership

1167
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:04,255
Ability and support of the national essential function

1168
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,279
During a catastrophic

1169
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,327
That clearly discuss

1170
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
Branches of government

1171
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
And separation of power

1172
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,191
It's Section 5 in

1173
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:16,799
It even goes on to enumerate what are considered nationalist

1174
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,359
There must be preserved

1175
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,663
What do you think the first thing listed is

1176
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:27,551
Quote ensuring the continued functioning of our form of government under the Constitution including the function

1177
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
Separate branches of government

1178
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,159
It's section 92 even stay quote

1179
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,511
Each branch of the federal government is responsible for its own continuity program

1180
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,583
88 the way Alex is treating

1181
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,167
This story now is if I heard all of what you said

1182
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:43,935
And then

1183
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
I was like

1184
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,103
Stanton would like instead of Comedy

1185
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,175
So this whole thing is a joke Dan

1186
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,735
That's how you know what they're really

1187
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,295
Is when they write comedy with Amy

1188
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,647
It's legitimately that level of misunderstanding

1189
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,463
It's locked up

1190
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,767
He's trying to say that the executive branch

1191
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,791
Is absorbing all of the

1192
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
Power Inn

1193
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
The legislative

1194
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,399
Judicial subordinates

1195
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
I've read.

1196
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,007
Congress's ceremonial

1197
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:24,639
The actual text

1198
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
Preserving these branches of government

1199
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:33,599
Preserving their separateness and are.

1200
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Delineate

1201
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,159
Get out

1202
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,439
Very specific

1203
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,255
Ptd 51 established a new position

1204
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,303
The national continuity Corden

1205
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,887
Who coordinate with Apartments about their continuity planning

1206
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,191
This position was designated specifically to

1207
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,031
Exist quote without exercising directive Authority

1208
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,567
Meaning they can't make any rule

1209
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Right

1210
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,919
It's a coordinate

1211
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,711
Are you doing that

1212
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
How about you

1213
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
You do that

1214
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:07,647
Okay cool they don't have to get involved with each other's business because that of course

1215
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
Would defeat the f******

1216
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,279
To the federal government

1217
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:17,119
Responsible for its own continuity program

1218
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,215
Just going to decide yours for you but we are going to say you better have one

1219
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:26,079
That's what this document is doing

1220
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
You what

1221
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
Some sort of Mastermind sort of Ozzy man who's organized

1222
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
We need to be prepared

1223
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:40,671
The document also lays out the responsibilities of the secretary

1224
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
Security +

1225
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
And none of them are

1226
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,559
Build

1227
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,399
Most of them are like assef local readiness

1228
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Response

1229
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Tastrophe

1230
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
And stuff like

1231
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,983
Conduct red unisex

1232
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,055
Code

1233
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,823
Taking your gun

1234
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:02,943
Also spoiler alert pb51 was really just an update in the PD 67 which is

1235
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,015
Issued by Bill Clinton on October 21st

1236
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:12,415
Which was Excel it's just an updating of HW Bush's PD d69

1237
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:16,767
92 which was itself an updated as National Security director

1238
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,559
90

1239
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,399
Which itself was an update and Reagan's and sd55

1240
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,447
From September 14th 1980

1241
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,519
All I will say is you guys got

1242
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,799
Your f****** numbering

1243
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,359
That did not work out right

1244
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:34,943
So wait so president under the new president the directive

1245
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:40,319
Number reset executive orders

1246
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:46,463
Well we should be on you need a coordinator e1244 right now

1247
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,303
I don't disagree with you does make things a little confusing but

1248
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,607
All of this stuff is to save that

1249
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,143
There was

1250
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,679
There's a sense that

1251
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:58,239
Need to know what's going to happen when there's an emergency

1252
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,031
We got that emergency happen

1253
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,823
We don't have time to make a plan

1254
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,407
No.

1255
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
Before you

1256
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,247
Prepared

1257
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,831
Yeah I read all these things that I've read the argument

1258
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:17,183
People like Alexandra Patriots and stuff make them

1259
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
Because they don't take

1260
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
You do need to be

1261
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Ready

1262
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
Like

1263
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Hey

1264
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:29,727
Worst case scenario someone sets off a bomb in Congress and

1265
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:34,335
50 senators.

1266
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
Leave some

1267
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,919
What do you do that

1268
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,967
We should have a plan in place

1269
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
These directives that have been

1270
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
Sent down since

1271
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
At least 19:8

1272
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
82 have been

1273
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,903
Convey incent

1274
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,207
That we need a plan when something happens

1275
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,743
Even if that thing is

1276
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,767
For unlikely

1277
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,559
Cuz if that happened

1278
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
We are fuc

1279
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:59,935
But that's what their deal

1280
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
If you are

1281
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,239
Caring for something

1282
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
They say

1283
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:09,663
You are f****** planning on doing it Alex

1284
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,967
If you don't prepare for something

1285
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Your fault

1286
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,015
Prepared

1287
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:20,415
That's the way when either way

1288
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,511
Food that'll like go bad in your attic

1289
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,071
And then blame you if you didn't use it

1290
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,863
Right right

1291
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
See this one

1292
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
See that's what I'm saying the government

1293
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
Cuz they want it

1294
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:43,711
To happen like it doesn't matter it's a lot of nonsense

1295
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
We're like

1296
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:49,343
Less than a minute in Alex's already misrepresented the idea that FEMA is under the national

1297
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
Security Council

1298
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
What is the Department of Asheville

1299
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,719
Security completely lied

1300
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
About

1301
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,767
The reality

1302
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:02,911
T1 and the history of it all that stuff so

1303
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,215
Like deep Waters

1304
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
Alex is

1305
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,031
He's out of his

1306
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,823
This is going to be

1307
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:16,223
Like legitimately he is

1308
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
The guy

1309
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
And that is

1310
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
That's your first

1311
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,903
Minute

1312
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Sad

1313
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:29,791
Susan Evans right after that first minute we think it's worse than even I think

1314
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:37,471
Also books

1315
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,775
News articles on the subject

1316
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,151
Is there so much

1317
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:49,503
Show many Congressional hearings

1318
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,343
Start

1319
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,439
But I will start

1320
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,511
Going over the fact

1321
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,791
That

1322
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,263
Supporters should be arrested in the army

1323
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
Good good

1324
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:18,431
I don't even know where to start

1325
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,991
Where I will start however is

1326
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,039
Bitching about this guy

1327
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,111
Glenn Beck sucks

1328
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,695
Bad

1329
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
Sign

1330
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
Now that's not

1331
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
That means

1332
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
You got

1333
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
Nothing

1334
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,119
I'll just give you my emotional experience

1335
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:42,239
Of listening to this episode

1336
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
FEMA camp

1337
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
Pronged

1338
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,871
Response the first was excitement cuz I like

1339
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,151
He's got to come correct

1340
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,503
Second one

1341
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
This is going to be

1342
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Which you did

1343
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:01,695
I kind of did there was there was a

1344
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,999
According Byzantine

1345
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:09,119
Both of your Bronx

1346
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
When we

1347
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,447
Do the first hour of the show

1348
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
About this Alex

1349
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,775
You are like me

1350
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
College

1351
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,895
You didn't prepare for an exam the night before

1352
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,271
I'm just replacing Donkey Kong Country will see what happen

1353
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:32,671
He's living in this in that space of like well I didn't prepare for this so if it goes well

1354
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,207
I didn't prepare

1355
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,047
He is but he's not presenting

1356
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:38,815
Problem

1357
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,863
Of course he's not like he's wrong

1358
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,959
That like females under the national

1359
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Security Council

1360
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
I'm like

1361
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
No

1362
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
And I'm like

1363
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,335
Oh really like

1364
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,103
Worried

1365
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,407
And then it was like where to start

1366
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
Glenn Beck sucks on like

1367
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,759
You have nothing

1368
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
I was

1369
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,343
Blown Away studying him for

1370
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,903
And I was even shocked

1371
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,183
By how little he

1372
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,231
Recognize that this matters

1373
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,023
Like this is a historical

1374
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,071
The day Alex Jones

1375
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,863
Had to talk about FEMA camps

1376
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,887
Any subs

1377
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:16,191
Definitive way

1378
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,215
And he's like

1379
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
Glenn Beck

1380
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:25,663
Motherfuker

1381
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,087
If that's where you

1382
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,671
I know you could have totally legit like

1383
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,255
Push it back

1384
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,327
I even wanted to get your Kohl's

1385
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,375
Information that I wanted to lay out but you know what

1386
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,911
I just got so busy

1387
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
Defending White

1388
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,959
People from murder

1389
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,031
I was very worried about

1390
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
About who

1391
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:59,711
Competence I think is what I'm looking for yeah I was worried about his ability to actually

1392
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,295
But I didn't think

1393
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,367
We're like an hour and 25 minutes into his show

1394
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,183
Next Kaiser's coming in

1395
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,207
3 hour mark

1396
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,743
Do you got a good

1397
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,535
You know our

1398
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,351
25 hour 30 in there

1399
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Maybe

1400
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,167
Our

1401
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,263
With commercial take that I don't know what you're going to talk

1402
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
I don't know I don't know how your

1403
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
What you got

1404
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
Barb

1405
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,295
Photocopies

1406
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,391
Miami Herald

1407
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,535
When they had pressure home

1408
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,863
Hearings dealing with Shadow government

1409
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,983
Martial law

1410
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Herold Rd

1411
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:08,831
Wants to talk about FEMA camps

1412
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
Fonzo

1413
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:15,743
Reagan aids for the secret government

1414
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
And it's about

1415
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:23,167
Iran-Contra Affair

1416
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:28,799
Either were or pretend to have been involved so I don't know what to do with that I mean

1417
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:35,199
Is that what you want to start with a misrepresented article about Trucking Oliver

1418
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,991
North

1419
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
Has Oliver North doing

1420
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
What's he up to these days

1421
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:46,463
He's running the NRA

1422
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,119
I know that Oliver North

1423
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,911
No proposed that Rex 84

1424
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,983
Use some of that talks about that

1425
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,895
Martial law

1426
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Here it is

1427
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,759
The only way they can pass this bill

1428
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:13,599
Is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere

1429
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,671
Miss fear is not justified

1430
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,999
Many of us were told in private conversations

1431
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,303
Did we voted against this bill

1432
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,583
On Monday

1433
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:31,007
3000

1434
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,567
And a few members were even

1435
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:37,919
Martial law in America if we voted

1436
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:40,735
Sparta

1437
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,575
Through The Obama Deception this is Bradshaw

1438
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:46,879
The house number

1439
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,951
The show in clarified

1440
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:55,583
Talk about what's real

1441
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,423
This is

1442
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
This is where your

1443
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:00,959
You're coming with

1444
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:07,103
Here's proof proof of a proof of FEMA camps

1445
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,895
A congressman said

1446
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
Something

1447
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,503
Vig

1448
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,063
But it's like

1449
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
Interlake

1450
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:22,207
What Brad Sherman was talking about was

1451
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,999
Consequences

1452
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:31,679
Which was about like the idea they're like

1453
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:35,519
For the game of telephone one guy says

1454
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,823
300

1455
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,551
This is bad Alex

1456
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,831
Nose that isn't

1457
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,855
Proof of anything

1458
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,415
What do you even weirder is that

1459
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:57,279
The very situation that he is siding Brad Sherman for

1460
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,863
Incorrect about is the situation that Alex is

1461
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,727
Everyone should be in a

1462
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,591
In order for these things to occur

1463
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,175
I'm going to create a state of constant panic

1464
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
In order to stop

1465
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,503
I guess

1466
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
So I actually f***** up

1467
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,855
Candy flip

1468
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
Apologize

1469
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,671
Because

1470
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:29,535
Cuz at this point Alex Jones brings up Army regulation 210 dash 35

1471
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,583
Disease civilian inmate labor

1472
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
For program

1473
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,655
So he brings that up as

1474
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
Real.

1475
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Apologize I weigh

1476
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
He's got talk about it later

1477
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,895
But he starts talking about how this is

1478
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
Slave everybody and

1479
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,479
Who is who is not

1480
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,807
Regulations

1481
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,343
Into 10-35 with

1482
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,647
Plane from 2005

1483
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,207
The place where they would take several prisoners

1484
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,743
And put them to work on Army base

1485
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:06,399
The reason for this was that it would be cheaper for them

1486
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:08,703
Quotes

1487
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,495
As well as

1488
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,287
Crowding in prison

1489
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:15,616
I want to be clear nothing I'm going to say is an anyway advocate

1490
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,176
This program or saying that it's okay but I am sitting out

1491
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:23,552
It's quite frankly a gross extension to convict leasing program

1492
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:27,648
Keep slavery around without calling it that Nan that I'm strongly against

1493
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,232
However Alex should have no fear of this program being used against him

1494
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,048
Infection paragraph

1495
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
The document lists

1496
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:38,144
The source of inmates that are eligible for the program

1497
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
And getting out of this program

1498
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,960
F****** easy

1499
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,496
They don't accept any sex

1500
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,776
Offenders and violent

1501
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
The Flight Risk

1502
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:48,896
Anyone who's been quote involved in drugs within the last 3 years

1503
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:54,016
Even drugs imprison anyone incarcerated for selling drugs anyone who's had a Vonage

1504
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:58,112
Give me problem at another facility anyone who committed arson

1505
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:04,512
The list goes on and on

1506
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:12,192
No because there is another qualification about like being part of a criminal conspiracy

1507
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,664
The reason they aren't interested in anybody who fits those descriptions is because this is about getting cheap

1508
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,456
People who fit those described

1509
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
Have a potential to make

1510
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
This is a gross

1511
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Evil program

1512
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,368
Which I have

1513
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,392
It's absurd

1514
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:35,232
Can anything other than abusive Financial arranged

1515
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Yeah they just one place

1516
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
Birchbox

1517
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,560
What's further

1518
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
To the point

1519
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,096
This

1520
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:40,864
Document from

1521
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
2005

1522
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,680
Isn't about starting

1523
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
It

1524
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:52,640
Clear if you read it that it's been going on a long time but this is what program is this

1525
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:59,040
This program is like

1526
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:04,672
Is literally them spelling out we want house slaves we don't want

1527
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,720
People who are going to be a flight

1528
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,000
Well

1529
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,816
Naruto are the part that's difficult for me

1530
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,376
Zip code for me is that I can't quite

1531
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Figure out exactly

1532
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,264
Because I feel like

1533
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:25,664
But at the same time about in the document that these people who would be used

1534
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,200
Wouldn't be allowed

1535
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,480
2 Cummins contact

1536
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
I think it's like digging ditches

1537
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:38,976
We have cotton plantations

1538
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Something like that

1539
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
Custodial work

1540
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:46,912
Cuz you're not allowed as one of these inmates they go into 8

1541
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,704
Quarters of the

1542
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,728
I think it has to

1543
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
You just like

1544
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,288
Really shity

1545
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:55,616
Yeah yeah

1546
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,640
And of course

1547
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,432
I'm against it

1548
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Angle on this should

1549
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,832
He is protecting the rights of the

1550
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
These prisoners

1551
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
Ice human

1552
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,928
Not that it's

1553
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:15,072
Think about this very real thing

1554
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,864
In the way he's talking about it

1555
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,888
What he does

1556
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,656
Is make

1557
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,472
A good portion of the

1558
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,264
Opposition to it

1559
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:25,568
Complaining

1560
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
Searcy theorist

1561
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:32,480
Yelling about a real thing in a fake

1562
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:36,064
We need to legislate forthright

1563
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,344
Fasteners

1564
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,696
And also you should see it as an extension of the thing that's going on at the actual prison

1565
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:45,536
You know this is that this isn't something that you still for into

1566
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,352
Just what incarceration is

1567
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,632
Like it is a

1568
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,936
The f*****-up thing to learn that like

1569
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
The Army is

1570
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,008
Using slave labor from

1571
01:23:55,264 --> 01:24:00,896
We should really get on this whole like the 13th amendment was a good

1572
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,432
Not

1573
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:07,296
The fifth

1574
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,112
Is that like

1575
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
Alex

1576
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,440
Perpetuating this idea that they're just going to

1577
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,536
Prison so you can get into the slave program

1578
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,328
That's kind of the argument

1579
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
Inmate labor program

1580
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,704
And even if you

1581
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
The worst about the

1582
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
The program

1583
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,312
Because they don't

1584
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:44,672
We got to marry man but I hate to relate this to buy playing civilization but like I love having a

1585
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:49,024
The Builder around

1586
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,632
The weights are realtors and over and over again

1587
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:58,240
The idea of incarcerating tons and tons

1588
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,520
The people in these

1589
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,544
Labor program

1590
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,080
You would end up with

1591
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:07,200
An excess of labor at that point interested in that

1592
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,224
4 hours

1593
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,248
Pacifically

1594
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,272
If he was

1595
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,344
For some reason by some miracle charged

1596
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,136
With probably

1597
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,208
Manslaughter charge

1598
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,256
That's a violent crime

1599
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:25,120
Fillmore and I guarantee he would have a quota management

1600
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
Problem

1601
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,544
Afraid of being put in

1602
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,336
Do the civilian labor program

1603
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,360
I would say if

1604
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:39,712
You get arrested for somebody

1605
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:45,856
There's a fee for this I will say that

1606
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,160
It's crazy this is so stupid

1607
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,696
It's really like

1608
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
If you want to talk about the substance

1609
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,024
Tissues in the real world about this

1610
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,560
You have to talk about prison

1611
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,888
You have to talk about like the underground

1612
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,680
The fact that this is like one of Alex's

1613
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,448
Those big pieces of

1614
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
I mean

1615
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,056
It's as close as he gets to real

1616
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:10,176
But it's still wrong

1617
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
It's not

1618
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,760
It's not correct minimizing the real problem which is

1619
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,040
Slaves are still around

1620
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
That's what he's doing he's like

1621
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,904
Hey they're going to turn you into slaves

1622
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,696
Without ever saying

1623
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:26,560
Hey we already have slight think I've ever heard Alex a convict

1624
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,328
Necklacing

1625
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:31,424
But I don't think I've ever heard talk about reality

1626
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192
Those

1627
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
It just served

1628
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:40,640
Continue slavery

1629
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,992
People people are becoming more

1630
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,528
I think that's a positive

1631
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,296
I hope so

1632
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
I think

1633
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,344
I think we're getting

1634
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,416
Dealing with

1635
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
But I still

1636
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,720
Long socks

1637
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,328
Episode whenever

1638
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:05,728
Real that the Republicans

1639
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,360
Clearly the point like

1640
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:15,968
So many Republicans everytime they pull out that like we're the party of Lincoln

1641
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,016
Where are the party that freed the slaves

1642
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,064
It's like well you guys wake up everyday

1643
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,832
Slaves man

1644
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:24,160
It's malicious app

1645
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,744
It's not OU

1646
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,840
A party we don't want to appear weak on continuing slavery

1647
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:36,960
Democrats

1648
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,544
Alex talks about that a little bit

1649
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,824
Beginning of sorry that I did

1650
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,616
B

1651
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
And why whatever he was

1652
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,688
Was full of s***

1653
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,736
Any we'll talk about it later

1654
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,528
And you'll see some

1655
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,344
So now at this

1656
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
Glenn Beck

1657
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,208
B*******

1658
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:58,976
Zoe

1659
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,000
Had his Pro

1660
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,048
We're getting hundreds

1661
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,352
He forgot something very important

1662
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:17,408
Says the president is a dictator

1663
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:36,096
Oh four point

1664
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:43,520
It's just so much right documents

1665
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:50,176
About parents

1666
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:04,000
And so we've got all of this year

1667
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,048
Look

1668
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,144
Makes it so governor

1669
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,240
You know they they're just serve at the Wyndham

1670
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:17,056
The president American history

1671
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
Pretty sure if a

1672
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
As somebody who is

1673
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,408
Just a small amount of

1674
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,736
I'm pretty sure that at

1675
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Any point in

1676
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,528
The president can

1677
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
You're fired

1678
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
Right

1679
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,488
Governor

1680
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,792
There's language

1681
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,328
The president can send out National

1682
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,632
State of emergency

1683
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,912
If martial law is declared

1684
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,448
Which previously was up to

1685
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,728
Governor

1686
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,264
Create a very weird set

1687
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,592
If there was

1688
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,640
President

1689
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:54,432
Requested National Guard troops

1690
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,456
And the governor said

1691
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,224
Knox

1692
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:02,624
Interesting situation

1693
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
Every time

1694
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,656
That's a good present

1695
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
Question

1696
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,472
The governor pullout National Guard troops

1697
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
They have

1698
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:23,104
I don't know I don't know if I sick but my point is that I think

1699
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:23,872
Generally

1700
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
If there were like

1701
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,944
Or if there were

1702
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,480
A horrible natural disaster

1703
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
Yeah the present

1704
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,528
Word to say

1705
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,320
I would like National Guard

1706
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,624
The governor would always say

1707
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,744
Bypass that step

1708
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,792
Is not going to Funk

1709
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,560
Emotionally change

1710
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,888
That much would have a little bit of discomfort

1711
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
With that

1712
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,424
Maybe

1713
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,008
Maybe there's something worth retaining and saying that the governor in present

1714
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,288
Coordinate on that

1715
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,616
Maybe you know what I actually

1716
01:30:55,872 --> 01:31:02,016
Ceremony

1717
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:08,416
I am concerned about how norms

1718
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,976
Violation of so many political Norm

1719
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,304
And

1720
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,632
Because imagine imagine for a moment

1721
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,424
Trump

1722
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,496
Having some sort of effort

1723
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:26,336
Having some sort of temperature

1724
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:30,432
We're going to send Arizona's National Guard to the Border

1725
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:36,320
Imagine that Evan

1726
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,648
The governor of one of those dates is like hey

1727
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,928
No we can't do that

1728
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,744
That makes sense

1729
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,536
I want to keep that one in place

1730
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:49,376
There's a middle ground that makes the most

1731
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:54,240
Give me the president not doing it unless it is a necessary emerge

1732
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,080
Requisite

1733
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,640
Middle-ground is coordination

1734
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,736
The president for the governor should necessarily

1735
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,016
Have final say on

1736
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,552
I think it should be some sort of

1737
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,576
Quorum thing

1738
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,856
Where we balance

1739
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,392
Respect

1740
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
Responsibility

1741
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,976
Sovereignty of the state

1742
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,768
Reality of the situation

1743
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,328
Four other states

1744
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,216
I think there is a middle ground that

1745
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:25,984
Is

1746
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,312
Easy to preserve

1747
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,384
As for the most

1748
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
Of life

1749
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:42,880
Who is just directing National Guard troops anywhere

1750
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,416
Governor can be like

1751
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,976
No I do we can't we

1752
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
We can't be doing

1753
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,560
Whittier adult an adult we can't be doing this

1754
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
Send

1755
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
If if

1756
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
The president

1757
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,144
Is so bad

1758
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Control

1759
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
And the

1760
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,496
The governor is like no Nash

1761
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,264
Guard troops

1762
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,824
That President will just send in the army

1763
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
The point of like

1764
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,176
It being

1765
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,224
Controllable by the governor

1766
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
Yeah that's

1767
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:15,136
That's true for the United States versus New Mexico

1768
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,160
Situation where there's a

1769
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:19,232
Crazy f****** governor who is not going to send the next

1770
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,256
Guard troops

1771
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,816
Even though f****** earthquake

1772
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,840
Just destroyed

1773
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,888
Right now that's where

1774
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:32,544
Brady's coming at you know that

1775
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,080
Private sector comes in

1776
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:34,848
Fixes everything

1777
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,920
Cars for kids without a front for

1778
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:42,528
It's complicated and I don't think I 100% support

1779
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,832
But I also

1780
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
Believe

1781
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,880
Reddit

1782
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
I've read that

1783
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,280
I don't think

1784
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,304
That figure

1785
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:57,632
And I think it is specifically about catastrophic

1786
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,400
Emergency

1787
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,192
Right like they do talk about like

1788
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,728
What sort of emergency

1789
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,008
It would be relevant

1790
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,544
Cause

1791
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,336
It'll be like

1792
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,128
It would be a huge

1793
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,408
Like let's say a meteor

1794
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:15,808
New Madrid fault

1795
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,880
Extreme enough for everybody

1796
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,416
Pretty Lights

1797
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,720
You like to eat something

1798
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,256
Hanzo's levels

1799
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,560
Fox

1800
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,608
And I don't think

1801
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,656
Streamlining who's

1802
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
Is responsible for

1803
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,960
Is necessarily A

1804
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,752
Because in

1805
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,544
That whole thing about

1806
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,824
Like you have to do preparation

1807
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,896
Before the event otherwise the preparation preparation

1808
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,272
Yeah everything is good in talapoin

1809
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,832
We're past that point

1810
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,392
We all need to be working on the same page

1811
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,440
I kind of understand where that comes

1812
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,720
Know the things

1813
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:58,560
The show has really doing the show the shows

1814
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,352
Doing the show

1815
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,400
Really given me far more appreciative

1816
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,472
Is the literal language

1817
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,496
That

1818
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,128
Players to have to write or or these kinds of things

1819
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,432
What it is like

1820
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:17,248
Yeah this this conversation we're having is

1821
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,040
One of such specified

1822
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,320
Then if you

1823
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:22,368
Buck up the language like a little bit

1824
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,136
Then you have some

1825
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:26,208
Place for Alex Jones

1826
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,352
What you're talking about

1827
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:39,520
Come on there's layers upon layers there's like Alex at the bottom with just

1828
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,288
Wildnout

1829
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,312
Knights of nonsense

1830
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,592
Misunderstand

1831
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,360
Zipline

1832
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,408
A pretending that everything

1833
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,432
Sing of the secret code

1834
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,808
Understand

1835
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,856
And nuance

1836
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
Even better

1837
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,656
And it's just unfortunate that

1838
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:12,288
It's just unfortunate that Alex

1839
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,080
Yeah it's another way to put it

1840
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,640
F****** dumb

1841
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,944
The next wants to make

1842
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
Gibson tours

1843
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Religion

1844
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,296
Of course of course

1845
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:26,624
He's trying to make his really don't know how that has anything to do with FEMA

1846
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
He's going all over

1847
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,488
If you need

1848
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,024
The broad spectrum in order make

1849
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,072
Good

1850
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352
He has to get ABC

1851
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,424
In order to make point B

1852
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,960
Because point B is

1853
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,032
Or non-existent

1854
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,312
That alphabet

1855
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,432
They're not

1856
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,712
They look fine

1857
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,576
You look better

1858
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
When all of them

1859
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,904
Some is greater than the parts

1860
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,208
That's it

1861
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,768

Tell him take shots

1865
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:39,584
They're paying on the television sets

1866
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:45,984
Sounds creepy if your problems with Romans 13

1867
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,032
F****** Bible

1868
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:54,432
Cuz it does say that all authority on Earth is destined by God or whatever

1869
01:37:54,688 --> 01:38:00,832
Bring up the Bible that they gave to Slaves prior to

1870
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,880
What were they ripped out all of those Passage

1871

Entirely about submitting to Authority

1873

Pastor Walt Mansfield who came out and became a whistleblower by the government and list

1874
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:24,128
Pastor is to indoctrinate their parishioners there's no official confirmation of any of this

1875
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,688

01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,304
News 12

1883
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,352
Just Google clergy response teams

1884
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,120
Send me all the

1885
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,400
I think it's from Louisa

1886
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:50,240
But if you find if you go and listen to this horribly.

1887
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,544
Local news

1888
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,640
Clip is playing

1889
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,664
The pastor

1890
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:02,272
The guy named dr. Gerald Phil which is an awful name

1891
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:06,368
Dr. Darrell cooperville

1892
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,144
The deal is but dr. tuberville quote serves as a Chaplain for the Shreveport fire department and

1893
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,680
Sheriff's Office

1894
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,728
He's a government employee

1895
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:25,056
None of this proves in any way that the government is going out and trying to

1896
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:30,688
Unless your pastor to turn them against he is the chaplain for the fire department

1897
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:33,760
Sheriff's office in recruiting pastors

1898
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,344
Pacified the fire department

1899
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,392
Dick the interview that they do

1900
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,160
Really scary

1901
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:42,720
Yeah

1902
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:49,376
FEMA programs

1903
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,424
Dude

1904
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,192
Like

1905
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:56,032
What else

1906
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,592
Shots because

1907
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,384
Walk YouTube

1908
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,272
The only interview in this whole very poorly

1909
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
News

1910
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:07,808
Production

1911
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,832
Is

1912
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,600
The guy who

1913
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:10,880
Works for

1914
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:16,768
I've tried to find any evidence

1915
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,816
Like Alex talks about the clergy response

1916
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,120
20 something thousand

1917
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:27,520
Preachers across the country there is nothing

1918
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,544
Nothing

1919
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
It is kind of

1920
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,128
You hear somebody be like

1921
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:34,432
Don't believe the Bible

1922
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,224
Alex says that a bit.

1923
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,832
The only place where is the scripture that's like

1924
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
Even the devil

1925
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Can quote scripture

1926
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,392
Or there's that one

1927
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
Yeah I got you

1928
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:48,000
The only sure has themselves covered coming and going don't they

1929
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:51,328
Response Team stuff is a loadable

1930
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:55,424
There is nothing behind

1931
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:00,544
If anyone can prove it to me I will change my position

1932
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,896
Champs

1933
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:06,944
Response

1934
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
Exist

1935
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,528
I will only believe

1936
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,808
That it is

1937
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
Actual

1938
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,392
Who are Gotham

1939
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
Employees

1940
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,976
Like this track

1941
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:24,096
And stuff like that committed volunteers

1942
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,656
The government already

1943
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,960
Who's server role to make sure that

1944
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,984
People don't

1945
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,056
You Crazy Russ

1946
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:38,432
I will go so far as to say that it is a show by Dick Wolf

1947
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,224
That is as far as I will go

1948
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,624
I would like to see that show

1949
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:54,048
Find Bowser can come to

1950
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,120
This stuff

1951
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,168
I just think it's terrible

1952
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,192
Yeah cuz

1953
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,984
Whereabouts

1954
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,824
3 minutes into Alex's actual breakdown of the

1955
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,640
He has a proxy

1956
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,480
20 minutes total to talk about it because Max guy

1957
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:15,040
That's a hard out on

1958
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,320
Proving my point

1959
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:20,160
I don't think he's proven his worth

1960
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,696
I don't think he's proven his

1961
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,840
Everyone please feel free

1962
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,864
Free to go listen to Alex

1963
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,400
April 6th 2000

1964
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,168
The 9 episode of

1965
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,704
It's not too hard to

1966
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,776
If you want to debunked the idea

1967
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,592
That I'm not bringing up every substitute

1968
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
Facts about

1969
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,432
Go for it I don't give a good luck

1970
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,736
She is said so much nonsense

1971
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
Back

1972
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,832
Obliquely reference

1973
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:54,976
He said the Miami Herald article in the 80s and I said I can go on

1974
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,024
Spent all his time doing stuff

1975
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,304
Stuff like that

1976
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,608
He's done nothing

1977
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
To prove to me

1978
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,656
In any way

1979
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,936
FEMA camp

1980
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,704
Absolutely

1981
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,776
More important

1982
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Isaac

1983
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,080
And II

1984
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,360
And probably

1985
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:13,408
Maybe but there has to

1986
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,432
To be some overlap

1987
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
Alex Jones

1988
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,528
Definitely

1989
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,296
Definitely

1990
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:20,832
Hasn't even

1991
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,600
Improvement

1992
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,368
To those p

1993
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,648
That Glen

1994
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:27,488
Nor is he actually rebutted anything that Glenn Beck

1995
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,024
Really

1996
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,792
Could

1997
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,144
You want

1998
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:38,240
The most generous to Alex

1999
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,776
What he's done is

2000
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,080
Create substantiv thing

2001
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:46,688
Like the inmate labor camp program at

2002
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:51,808
But he knows that Glenn Beck won't talk about Glenn Beck

2003
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:57,440
Make me like you never touch that

2004
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,720
Not like

2005
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:02,816
It's good it's good for

2006
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:06,400
What I'm saying is we're 40 minutes

2007
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:09,216
And he says this is also

2008
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,240
Problem

2009
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,056
Go over

2010
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,872
Title

2011
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:20,224
Here is the text of HR 645 National Emergency

2012
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:24,320
Establishment

2013
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,904
We'll run

2014
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:32,256
Knightley movies

2015
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,304
Well it's not that bad

2016
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:38,144
40 minutes

2017
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:44,544
Debunking the started an hour and 20 minutes into his f****** show

2018
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,336
Of news that saves FEMA camp

2019
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,640
That's not good cuz your s***

2020
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:53,504
Before this says HR 645

2021
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,368
This bill that involves the clergy response teams and nightly movies8 f****** doesn't

2022
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,160
Andy died in committee

2023
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:04,768
It was a builder's super unpopular this dude pitched a couple times before

2024
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:09,120
FEMA camps

2025
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:11,424
I'm going to say it

2026
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,264
It should have accounted for the future.

2027
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,616
Who's going to watch The Wire

2028
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,152
Who's going to watch The Wire

2029
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,432
We need nightly

2030
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:28,064
Homeland have a chance

2031
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:34,464
My favorite show ever Foothill stable

2032
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
Yeah

2033
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:39,840
Nonsense isn't in the bill

2034
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,888
But the reasons it has never had any

2035
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
Retraction is largely

2036
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:43,936
Because of the

2037
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,752
Problems

2038
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,080
You need to repurpose a bunch of playwright

2039
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,640
People could go in an emerge

2040
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:55,200
Correct

2041
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,736
F*** that me up

2042
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:59,808
Demonstration of lack of preparation

2043
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
The fact

2044
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,880
HR 645

2045
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,928
Alex doesn't know that at

2046
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
He should know that

2047
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,256
I'm talking about your health

2048
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:10,048
But it wasn't

2049
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:11,840
52

2050
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,120
7

2051
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,656
Yay

2052
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,680
Never went anywhere

2053
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,752
That is what he comes in first with his

2054
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:22,080
This is the build its going to do it not recognized

2055
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,360
Volume

2056
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
Unsuccessful ping pong

2057
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:35,648
It's not good and it gets worse when he gets to his next article in here we go

2058
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,416
Hundred

2059
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,952
In the stack of

2060
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
FEMA camp

2061
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:40,768
It's labeled FEMA

2062
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:47,424
Wall Street Journal homeland security contract

2063
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:55,104
Free 1000000% FEMA camps in the United States

2064
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,128
Okay

2065
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:06,880
This is a story about an engineering and construction company being awarded a contract to support ice facilities

2066
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:11,232
Also Alex fails to mention in the article that in the article

2067
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,024
We are also have this contract

2068
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,864
2002-2005

2069
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:20,960
Because if it is about

2070
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,776
Weather going back to at least 2,000

2071
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,592
4911

2072
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,128
Course

2073
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,688
It's all this is about

2074
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,736
Creating

2075
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,016
This is.

2076
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:40,160
This isn't this isn't real strong atrocity

2077
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:46,560
You could be useful

2078
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:50,912
I like you.

2079
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,704
Also let's be honest

2080
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:56,032
385 million is

2081
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:02,432
Nothing's what it would require to Cree

2082
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,456
FEMA camp

2083
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:09,856
Control the entire scale altamed

2084
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:16,256
Drop in the bucket

2085
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:22,656
In there for dinner

2086
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,704
Hayward

2087
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,528
ER has now been given all this money in order to

2088
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
Champs.

2089
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,600
Contract

2090
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
The time that you

2091
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:46,976
And it was about Isis

2092
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:50,304
Second

2093
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,328
About these

2094
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,096
Contract

2095
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,120
That are going around

2096
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,912
The prove that FEMA camps exist

2097
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,472
Here's the New York

2098
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:03,360
Halliburton subsidiary get the contract to add temporary

2099
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:07,968
Immigration Detention Center just like

2100
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:14,368
Martial law

2101
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:22,560
Halliburton subsidiaries

2102
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:29,728
Now the bigger picture in that clip is that Alex is saying that

2103
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,264
Rex 84

2104
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,800
Ruby Skye

2105
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:40,480
Immigrants come again but it would really be a plan to make martial law

2106
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:42,272
Remind everyone that in 28

2107
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:43,552
Alex said

2108
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,600
Trump is initiating Rex

2109
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
Before

2110
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,904
Because it was acting

2111
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,512
I thought it was about martial law but it's really actually about the immigrants

2112
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,072
Crazy games

2113
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,608
A hundred percent

2114
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,400
It's all about

2115
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:04,800
The ghost white whiteness you could wait you can see that demonstrated so clearly it's

2116
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:07,104
Especially when he's talking about the exact same thing

2117
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
2009

2118
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,968
He's talking about

2119
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,760
I have the secret knowledge

2120
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,296
That it's not

2121
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:19,392
Really about illegal immigrant

2122
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,696
In 2018

2123
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,512
When he sang the Trump is putting rx80

2124
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:25,792
The action

2125
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,560
He says

2126
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,584
Look

2127
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:31,680
The reality is it appeared to be about locking up the Patriot

2128
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:33,472
But it's actually about

2129
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:35,008
Making sure our borders are so

2130
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:37,824
Whatever

2131
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,384
Nonsense it's really

2132
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,712
I want him to be

2133
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,480
Better

2134
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,808
Do you know what that is thought that I had repeat

2135
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:51,136
Yeah I really I really did

2136
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,928
Like

2137
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
Look

2138
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,000
Whatever

2139
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:58,048
Intubate with Alex Jones I'd probably lose

2140
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,168
It would it would probably

2141
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:06,496
I want to respect

2142
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,288
I could use a monster

2143
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,080
You really bad dude

2144
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,872
And I'm against him like I

2145
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:15,200
Play my wife about being against him

2146
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:18,272
Better

2147
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:19,552
Legitimately

2148
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,576
Prove

2149
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,368
You have one objective

2150
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,648
You go in

2151
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,952
Nose-to-the-grindstone

2152
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,232
Adjust

2153
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,512
F****** do it

2154
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,792
And this is the outcome

2155
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,376
It is disappointing

2156
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:40,032
Know this whole thing reminds me so much

2157
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,312
Much of an argument with my

2158
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,616
Any argument where it's like

2159
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,152
You're mine

2160
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,176
Family

2161
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,200
I want

2162
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,480
To love you

2163
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,504
I don't want to

2164
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,832
If you're going to be

2165
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:57,184
The thing that you're doing at least to the level where I'm not

2166
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:01,792
Comes down to

2167
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,120
Necessarily with your fam

2168
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,824
Handle this level of

2169
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:19,968
Yeah

2170
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,736
I thought

2171
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:21,760
Alex

2172
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:27,136
Oh you poor bastard I thought there was a chance you poor back to the last

2173
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:33,536
2 years of episodes that I've been listening listen to the right episode

2174
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:38,912
Maybe he had a lot of fucken gas in the tank

2175
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:41,216
He has to prove

2176
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:47,360
I'm going to be in trouble because he's actually going to prove you thought he was going to pull

2177
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,640
Drop a hammer

2178
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:55,040
I did I really really did

2179
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:58,368
Howlongtobeat

2180
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:04,256
Think that he was going to be there was a party

2181
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:11,680
O'Reilly's liars and frauds

2182
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:16,288
Like all the time if you want to like I think there's an impulse

2183
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,312
Polite Society

2184
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,848
They just don't want to push

2185
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,616
Who's back on

2186
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,200
Your conflict

2187
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:25,760
I mean

2188
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,368
Don't be afraid of pushing back

2189
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,392
Stuff like this because

2190
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,536
This is the day

2191
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:40,096
Yeah supposed to come correct

2192
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,400
Pathetic

2193
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,704
We're still in the Alex's stack

2194
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,520
Another one

2195
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,312
Also

2196
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:55,712
George Bush

2197
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:57,504
Doesn't sound right

2198
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:05,440
That was the internment camps

2199
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:10,304
I mean I'm not cutting sudeste with the same way the Germans preserve f******

2200
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:14,144
Like instances where he

2201
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
Says

2202
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:15,936
Like

2203
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:20,544
Good points for react

2204
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,080
Nothing specific I can look in

2205
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,920
Alex is actually correct

2206
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,712
That bush

2207
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,736
Reserve internment

2208
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:35,136
Park services to restore and pay

2209
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,160
Search

2210
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,976
Preserved

2211
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,024
A reminder of how the United States

2212
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,352
Turn down some of its own citizens at a time of fear

2213
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:47,680
Yes 100%

2214
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:50,752
Yes tournament to Historic Site

2215
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:54,592
Museums of the National Park Service

2216
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:57,152
At the time bushes Finance

2217
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,712
From WWII already served

2218
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,504
The plan was just to

2219
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,064
This is not

2220
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,600
There's no f******

2221
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,160
Piece of this at all that is bushes

2222
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,440
Trying to reopen

2223
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,720
Right

2224
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:13,536
We can all learn

2225
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:20,960
At least super valuable where you wish they were publicized more so more people

2226
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:24,032
Diamond be like

2227
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:26,848
American not being that great isn't

2228
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,128
Indication that

2229
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:28,896
You hate America

2230
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:33,248
Or anything like that

2231
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,784
In order to make America

2232
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:35,808
As good as it

2233
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,856
Again

2234
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:38,880
Those sorts of

2235
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:41,696
First order

2236
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,976
Horrible things that we

2237
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:47,072
We've done we need to

2238
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:51,936
What I represent a references earlier but the slave Bible there likes

2239
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:54,496
4 copies in America

2240
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:58,080
This place really really damning and imp

2241
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,104
Important piece of his

2242
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:01,664
Because you understand

2243
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:06,784
That and you say they were against slavery

2244
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,552
You know

2245
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:08,832
That these people

2246
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,392
Went into the f****** Bible

2247
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:13,440
Self-important

2248
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,464
Remove

2249
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,744
Every path

2250
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,536
About any kind of free

2251
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,864
Every single part of that Bible

2252
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:24,704
Mention baby you shouldn't be a f****** slave they removed

2253
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,752
And gave it to slate

2254
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:28,800
They use the Rangers

2255
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:29,568
Purpose

2256
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:38,784
Religion as a weapon against freedom and equality

2257
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,088
The weapon against

2258
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:48,000
Everyone being people

2259
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:53,120
Religion

2260
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,656
In order

2261
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,192
Just own up to those things

2262
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,216
Celebrate

2263
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:01,312
I don't mean celebrate like Horeb understand

2264
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,384
Jesus

2265
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,920
Denying them just

2266
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:12,320
Thumbs up if you want to say how great your f****** Bible is then you also have to

2267
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,856
Except that there are people

2268
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:14,880
Always

2269
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,416
Alter the Bible

2270
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,952
To make it do what

2271
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:18,976
They wanted to

2272
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:22,560
The simple a workout

2273
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:24,864
That's what I texted or not

2274
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,656
Bible do

2275
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:32,544
Jesus up sorry

2276
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:39,712

Jordan

2278
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,040
We've seen some things

2279
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,064
Is that Alex has brought

2280
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,368
Receive

2281
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:53,792
Call wise but yeah you're giving things a lot of weight and that's it

2282
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:03,264
Alex has to work there are work just substantially like that's

2283
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:09,664
We've seen Alex use a lot of ghosts very clear

2284
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,968
At the beginning of no substance

2285
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,784
But I do think he said

2286
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:21,184
Fayetteville civilian inmate labor program is a thing

2287
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,976
Conversation to have

You having his

2289
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:27,584
It was called

2290
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,144
Civilian weird were slaves

2291
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:33,216
Tdd 51 is a real thing

2292
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:38,336
These news articles Miami Herald article article

2293
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,616
Like all this stuff is like

2294
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,640
He's lying

2295
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,200
The government

2296
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:45,504
Oh that's

2297
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,528
Executive orders

2298
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,624
Actually

2299
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,160
Probably

2300
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,720
It tickled me more than

2301
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:55,488
Numbers

2302
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,792
I've ever discovered America

2303
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:03,680
I thought I would go over

2304
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:11,104
Executive orders

2305
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:14,432
President

2306
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:17,760
Testing emergency preparedness functions

2307
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:23,648
Okay

2308
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:28,256
And this is just one of 11

2309
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,536
Thousand

2310
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:35,936
Supervision

2311
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:37,472
You can go read that if you

2312
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,240
You'd like to

2313
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:44,640
So this is an executive order from JFK who I thought Alex was the last real president

2314
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:48,992
The Federal Reserve

2315
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:53,856
You're using blazing the public you put out

2316
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:56,928
Put in executive order 11000

2317
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:58,720
Really nice of him to make it a nice

2318
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,744
Even number

2319
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,656
Yeah that's great Alex half

2320
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:08,704
In his conception

2321
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:14,848
Mississippi truhitte wrong about it

2322
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,872
Coup

2323
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,920
Put on executive order

2324
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:18,944
That was going to

2325
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:25,344
Federal Reserve which being murdered by the evil forces under the sway of the Federal Reserve

2326
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,416
He put out an executive order

2327
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:34,816
Athens Enslaved the American public good with abet the rough with the smooth or whatever like this

2328
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:36,864
Is nonsensical

2329
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,776
Also disorder was overturned by Nixon's executive order 11 490

2330
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,544
Binding today

2331
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,640
What is 11000 + 1

2332
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:53,248
Around 4 11001

2333
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:57,344
Also has been no vaccines executive

2334
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:03,232
Even if it has been overturned and all that stuff

2335
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:05,024
Even if it were still

2336
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:08,096
Today

2337
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,120
Do anything

2338
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,656
Even in emergencies

2339
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,424
Situation

2340
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,240
That executive order 11000 was

2341
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:15,776
Instructions

2342
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,800

2343
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,336
Power that was available

2344
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,104
In a crisis

2345
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:21,664
Section 4 C

2346
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,432
Laser

2347
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,200
Create

2348
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:23,968
Incentive

2349
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:26,272
For people to join the civilian labor force

2350
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,296
Quote

2351
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:32,416
Develop plans and procedures for wage and salary compensation at death and disability compensation

Re-employment write-in occupational safety and other protections

2355
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:45,216
For the civilian labor force during emerging

2356
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:46,752
This is about

2357
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,776
Non

2358
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:49,056
Government

2359
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:53,408
Like non-military employees in this

2360
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,176
Is not

2361
02:01:54,432 --> 02:02:00,320
I'm going to get stripped can script you a ride military government

2362
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:02,368
Employee is like hey

2363
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:04,160
We should probably pay people in

2364
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,768
Gas there is that but it's also how best

2365
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:09,792
To use the resources

2366
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:12,608
Does that are available military

2367
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,144
People during crisis

2368
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,680
That is literally nothing

2369
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:18,496
Executive order

2370
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,264
A lot

2371
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,032
About like

2372
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:21,056
Using

2373
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,080
Civilian

2374
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,128
Power in a crisis situation

2375
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:26,944
But understood correctly

2376
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,480
It's not talking about like

2377
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,016
All the civilians

2378
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:30,784
To do that

2379
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:37,184
It's not like it's not like taking shaking down your apartment building and using you all to dig a ditch

2380
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:42,816
About non-military government employees billions

2381
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:46,912
Women during World War like they were like okay well

2382
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,544
How about you guys built

2383
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,640
To do that no

2384
02:02:56,896 --> 02:03:01,760
Encourage through

2385
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
But there wasn't

2386
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:06,368
Conscription

2387
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696
This is all like

2388
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,976
This is crazy

2389
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,512
First of all

2390
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,304
I know but I can't

2391
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,840
I can't get over it the idea that Alex

2392
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:18,656
Is just throwing this out without bringing up yet

2393
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:21,728
Executive order it's not like

2394
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,008
He didn't do that

2395
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,824
Like an executive order

2396
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:30,944
He has all the control the world over what executive orders he puts out

2397
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,480
That is part of being

2398
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:35,040
President to do with it

2399
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:40,160
Wasn't too is that

2400
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:46,816
But it's also way before then this is nonsense man from up from a like

2401
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:50,144
Fix proper propaganda

2402
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:51,936
Big problem

2403
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:56,288
Yeah because they undercut so much of the other propaganda

2404
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,312
I need to put in the water

2405
02:03:57,568 --> 02:04:00,128
He's not talking about the Federal Reserve nonsense

2406
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,760
He can imagine that all that stuff doesn't feel like

2407
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,832
Yeah really does

2408
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:10,368
And so for him to believe

2409
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,392
The JFK was such a

2410
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,416
Threatening president

2411
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:13,440
The globalist

2412
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:15,744
Who are in charge of the Federal Reserve

2413
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
Call Sophie

2414
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,608
It just doesn't they got the whole they got the whole back

2415
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,632
It just doesn't

2416
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:25,216
Makes I wish it was none of this makes sense

2417
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:29,056
It's over 9000

2418
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,896
Yeah that'd be great

2419
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:33,920
I got back

2420
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:36,736
He also talks about a couple other executive orders

2421
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:43,648
10990 Weisgarber to take over all modes of transportation to control on highways

2422
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:50,048
Defense authorization act and others

2423
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:56,448
Executive order 10,000 995

2424
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:58,752
Emergency alerts

2425
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,288
It goes on like that

2426
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,568
Quite a while

2427
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,872
Let me ask you a question real quick

2428
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,920
How far into Obama

2429
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:09,248
What you mean when this episode

2430
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:15,648
Recorded so where at

2431
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:16,416
January 20th

2432
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,464
I it's not about Obama

2433
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,792
I know but essentially what he saying is that

2434
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,816
Obama has

2435
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:24,352
Accelerated these programs

2436
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,912
S450

2437
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,936
What's years

2438
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:31,520
And most of them aren't already been on.

2439
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:34,080
Like executive order 10 990

2440
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:40,480
Executive order didn't allow the Takeover all of all the roads and s*** like that

2441
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:42,272
Cancel to overseed

2442
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:44,576
Civilian federal government employees

2443
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:48,672
That's why I was order 11 6

2444
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:55,072
12 in 1971 titled quote occupational safety and health programs for federal employees

2445
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:59,168
Know that photo that was for

2446
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:00,704
Powder before yeah sorry

2447
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:07,104
Apologies executive executive order 10995 that he brought up

2448
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,896
We'll take the Takeover of the

2449
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:09,664
About emergence

2450
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,432
Broadcast

2451
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:17,088
Trump is forcing people to get cell phone messages

2452
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:23,488
I've never gotten one

2453
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:29,888
Yeah yeah

2454
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:31,936
You're fine

2455
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:33,216
Fall back

2456
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:37,568
Also nothing contained in this order Shelby

2457
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,152
Jurisdiction of

2458
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,176
The Federal Communication

2459
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:47,808
Checks and balances even in that executive order

2460
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,832
Also that exact

2461
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,368
Order was revoked on

2462
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:55,232
Executive order 11

2463
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:58,304
But here's the bigger picture

2464
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:02,912
Four-door Nixon but Nixon

2465
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:05,472
Manma

2466
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:10,336
Executive orders

2467
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:12,896
12

2468
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Insult

2469
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:16,480
In order to confuse and annoy

2470
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,248
A little bit

2471
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,320
Yeah is actually give me a window

2472
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:21,600
Who's getting the info

2473
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,672
If he's rattling office

2474
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,952
Series of executive order

2475
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,720
Does that suggest

2476
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:27,744
But somebody else is already

2477
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,512
Compiled

2478
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,280
T-Series

2479
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,584
That suggested

2480
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:35,168
Somebody has already put together a list of these executive orders

2481
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:41,312
Suggesting what Alex is already about to say you can look up who has

2482
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:44,640
Compile this kind of list of orders before and what

2483
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:50,784
Their motivations are. I assume you've done zero research at all because this is

2484
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,088
Not really r-mo

2485
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:56,928
Alex's literally reading off a chain email

2486
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,464
No

2487
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:03,840
His wording about what executive orders is literal

2488
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:07,424
Exactly word for word 121

2489
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,984
One from a

2490
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,776
You can find on factcheck.org

2491
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:16,640
Does any research capabilities

2492
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:21,248
He's literally on this episode reading off something your grandma might have said

2493
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:23,808
Like this is ridiculous

2494
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:29,184
Because diesel forward forward forward

2495
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,464
The government coming to kill

2496
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:33,024
Like this is embarrassing level

2497
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:37,632
But yeah

2498
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,912
Executive orders

2499
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:41,984
Google

2500
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,032
I figured out why I was trying to figure out

2501
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:49,152
Like I don't I don't believe in executive order put out in the seventies made all

2502
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:49,920
Road

2503
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:56,320
Under the sea

2504
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:58,112
It also seems like the

2505
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,928
Why haven't they done that

2506
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:05,536
Like why has it been 40-50 years that they they

2507
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:08,352
Had control of everything and then been like

2508
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:09,888
Forcella

2509
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,168
The snake news

2510
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:14,752
How much slow-playing do you need

2511
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,800
Like that's what I'm saying

2512
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:20,128
So I looked the executive orders

2513
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,408
Three of them that he said

2514
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:27,808
How can I be right back checked out

2515
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:30,624
Dot-org articles

2516
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:34,208
Yay early 2000

2517
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:35,488
Time frame

2518
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,584
And it weighs a similar time.

2519
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,120
What do you mean by that

2520
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:45,984
Early 2000

2521
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:48,800
What time. Are we in

2522
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,152
This

2523
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,944
Has a list of executive order

2524
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:57,504
And descriptions of what they are

2525
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:58,784
The

2526
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,064
Are not correct

2527
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:01,344
They don't

2528
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,136
Alex

2529
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,928
Literally

2530
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,952
Is reading off

2531
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:07,488
You can you can

2532
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,256
But it's

2533
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:11,584
It's crazy for me to try and describe what I mean by this week

2534
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,352
Because I'm not going to

2535
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:13,120
Play that clip

2536
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:16,448
I was as I was

2537
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,728
Hearing him read

2538
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:18,496
Is the next like

2539
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:20,288
5

2540
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,080
Oh my God

2541
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,104
It's almost like a strip

2542
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:26,176
He's just now

2543
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,712
God dammit

2544
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:30,016
Maybe what we should have been angry at the

2545
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,040
This whole time is Alec

2546
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:31,808
Texas grandma

2547
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:37,440
No cuz she was soft killed by a vaccine

2548
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:44,096
Why do I know that

2549
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:53,312
We should have been angry at

2550
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:55,616
Off of his me whatever he was growing up

2551
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:57,408
Anyway Alex reads a bunch of

2552
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:58,944
Executive orders

2553
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:01,248
Where's which are all spurious and they're all just

2554
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:03,808
He has done no research

2555
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:06,368
He hasn't read the executive orders

2556
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:08,928
If he had he would know that most

2557
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:09,696
Shazam don't stay

2558
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,024
Sammy Sosa

2559
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:16,096
Executive orders

2560
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:22,496
Now I want to get more versus the strawman argument

2561
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,688
I'll stay with you

2562
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,248
Unfortunate

2563
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:35,552
Is that like a I've covered these exact

2564
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:38,624
Active orders now we're going to get to the FEMA camps

2565
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:40,160
Yeah

2566
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:43,232
This is all supposed to be about the FEMA camps

2567
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,304
At all

2568
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:51,424
Continue to forgot that this entire episode

2569
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:55,776
Every time we do it

2570
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:56,544
Okay

2571
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:02,432
He has got to be focused about this one thing Ryan to do this

2572
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:06,784
Are you for real this is what the episode is about and honestly that mirrors bikes

2573
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,320
Listening to

2574
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:18,304
We're doing the FEMA camp episode right I understand if you want to talk about

2575
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:20,096
Right

2576
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:23,680
Gunn g agree

2577
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:24,448
It's

2578
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:25,216
Not

2579
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:28,544
We're talking about a funeral

2580
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,104
Oh now I'm interested

2581
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,384
Has he ever

2582
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,920
Focused on one topic

2583
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:35,200
I mean he's trying

2584
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:37,760
No I mean but like have we ever

2585
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:43,904
Well we're two years in the closest was that episode that disgraceful

2586
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:50,304
Oh yeah

2587
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,584
Then that one was like

2588
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:57,728
Cuz that was just the way for him to ramble on about 10 million different other

2589
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,520
Said he was pretty on point

2590
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:00,800
You stay

2591
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:01,824
Close to the harbor

2592
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:05,408
My mind so much as

2593
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,480
It's one of the times that it's really stuck out

2594
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:10,016
The show Almost

2595
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:11,296
Entirely about

2596
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,088
Yeah

2597
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:14,880
He tries sometimes

2598
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:17,696
2050

2599
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:19,488
Episode

2600
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:26,656
Argue for the ban of Muslims

2601
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:28,960
Like I think he tried to do that

2602
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:30,240
We failed

2603
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:31,520
Cuz that episode is all over

2604
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:34,336
You know what I think. It reminds me of my

2605
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,872
Hey I've changed

2606
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:37,408
I'm changing

2607
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:43,808
Remind remind me of my favorite moments of 2018

2608
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,088
Hearing him say

2609
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:56,864
I'm a big fan of dead down to Grand Prix

2610
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:03,264
Might have been the hardest I've laughed wow like just listening to a show

2611
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:09,664
So I think that does deserve it if we're making a

2612
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:13,760
2018 Mount Rushmore

2613
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,576
That

2614
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:20,928
Bill Ayers is in there

2615
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:26,304
Mount Rushmore

2616
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:29,632
So

2617
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,680
Like I just think

2618
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:33,216
This is really

2619
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:39,360
I feel like I've lost a little bit of my interest

2620
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:40,896
In talking about how bad

2621
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:43,456
Mirrors

2622
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:44,480
My experience

2623
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:47,040
I came in guns blazing

2624
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:48,320
Pens blazing is like

2625
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:51,136
Take a note

2626
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,672
45 minutes

2627
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:54,208
I'm starting to talk about

2628
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:55,488
FEMA camps

2629
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:00,352
Boo

2630
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:07,520
I don't not doing him saying things I disagree with eyebright

2631
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,544
It's it's just

2632
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:11,360
What I

2633
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:14,944
The reason I'm deeply ashamed that I forgot that clip about the

2634
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:17,760
Inmate labor program earlier

2635
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:18,784
Is because

2636
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,576
When he gets back

2637
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:21,344
From break

2638
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:25,952
He says I've covered these executive orders were going to get back at ya

2639
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:29,280
When he comes back from break this is what he brings up

2640
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
And I thought

2641
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:33,888
This is the white flag of surrender I have no

2642
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:43,872
Civilian inmate labor camp program Army regulation 210

2643
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:50,016
If you only heard that is the first time

2644
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:53,088
Chinese bring it up right

2645
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:56,672
Explain why

2646
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:57,952
Not know that stuff

2647
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:59,488
But it's not

2648
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:01,536
This is him bringing it back up

2649
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:06,656
Half an hour later after he's already talked about it yet

2650
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:11,520
It's new information right

2651
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:12,288
He talks about it

2652
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:15,872
And just

2653
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:18,688
This is the big piece of news

2654
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:19,712
If not new

2655
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:21,248
This is to establish

2656
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:29,184
Prison labor camps

2657
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:34,048
Representative

2658
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,840
Policy statement

2659
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:42,496
Governing Provisions operating civilian prison camps

2660
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:45,312
Installations

2661
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:48,128
He's just reading the headings

2662
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:50,944
Yeah he has no ability to

2663
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,736
Have a conversation about what

2664
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:54,016
Chris Pratt

2665
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,296
If you have

2666
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:56,320
Don't have the information

2667
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,928
To have a conversation about what is

2668
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:03,744
Right back

2669
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,512
That to me is

2670
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,536
Incredibly

2671
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,840
This is the second time it's been brought up

2672
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,376
In terms of this

2673
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:10,656
This whole FEMA camp

2674
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:11,936
18

2675
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:12,960
Big news

2676
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:13,728
It's not new

2677
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:15,776
Is 4 years after

2678
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,592
Yeah of course

2679
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:19,360
And

2680
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,944
That to me is

2681
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,968
Real f******

2682
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:26,784
If you have a car like a propagandist

2683
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,064
Like

2684
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,904
Or even pestova

2685
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,184
Probably

2686
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:36,256
Generally speaking

2687
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:39,328
Wade into Waters that they don't know something about

2688
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:41,376
Right deflector

2689
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:50,080
That's not what we really talked

2690
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:56,480
Yeah that's a part of it but also it is

2691
02:17:56,736 --> 02:18:00,064
You'll never pin me down position

2692
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,600
On whatever it is

2693
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:06,976
Prepared to talk about not saying I'm going to have

2694
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:09,024
Republican debate

2695
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:11,072
When I See This sort of behavior

2696
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:13,888
From Alex when I see him have the

2697
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:15,680
Labor camp program

2698
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:16,448
Document

2699
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,728
On camera

2700
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:20,544
Like and he's just reading the headings

2701
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:22,848
With no no

2702
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:25,920
Awareness of what it's

2703
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:26,944
And about yet

2704
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:30,272
I just see a shower light ICA

2705
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:35,136
Loquacious

2706
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,928
Yeah I like it's just someone who's

2707
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:37,696
Good at

2708
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:40,768
And doing somebody

2709
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:43,072
No one is forced to

2710
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:43,840
To do this

2711
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:44,864
No one

2712
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:45,888
His foursome

2713
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:46,912
To sit down

2714
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:56,128
Enforcing to proved FEMA camps exist

2715
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:00,736
Piece of evidence

2716
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:02,016
That he brought up

2717
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:06,880
Understand

2718
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,416
He doesn't know how to have a

2719
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,768
Is deeply depressing

2720
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:15,328
He's trying

2721
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,120
Through this

2722
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:22,752
Is we get to this point

2723
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:23,776
Use the bunker

2724
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:24,800
Yeah

2725
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:26,080
Throw whatever spaghetti

2726
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:29,408
Narrative

2727
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,480

This is for domestic operations

2731
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:55,520
The only way you would ever have that perception

2732
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:57,824
If you read the Infowars article about

2733
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,360
Because that's not what have

2734
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:01,408
An exercise

2735
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,736
That one

2736
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:09,088
That was such a bummer like that was a bummer

2737
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:12,160
To the point to the point where you're like

2738

Weeks ago or something like that

2744
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:28,800
In the timeline in 2009

2745
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,336
We covered like

2746
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:34,688
Like this should be a piece of your mythology

2747
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,224
If you're talkin about FEMA

2748
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:40,576
Champs

2749
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:41,600

50 year span to get your information from

2751
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:46,208
And one of the things

2752
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:48,512
You're going to throw out is Ally from

02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:54,720
It's just for mechanics

2794
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:56,256
Instead of somewhere in the middle

2795
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:59,840
There's a lot of s*** articles and stuff

2796
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:01,120

They were wrong about 9/11

2803
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,296

02:23:54,624 --> 02:24:00,768
I did not understand that Dillon Avery

2821
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:04,096
And I was involved as well.

2822
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,400
Versions of it because things are like

2823
02:24:07,168 --> 02:24:07,680
That can't

2824
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:12,032
I appreciate

2825
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:17,920
Very clearly associated with

2826
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:19,712
Legacy of 911 truth

2827
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:22,528
I'm not going to say the Popular Mechanics

2828
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:25,600
I'm not going to stay there

2829
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:27,392
Right on all fronts

2830
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,928
But I'm going to say

2831
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:31,488
With them over there

2832
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,048
So Glenn Beck has this guy

2833
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,072
Exxon

2834
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:37,376
F****** boring

2835
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:40,192
Alex is fairly close to

2836
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:41,728
Predictions that he make

2837
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:44,032
It's about like the idea that they're going to go to

2838
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,824
These these FEMA

2839
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:51,200
Some stuff like that

2840
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:54,272
This is Mark from Newark playing

2841
02:24:54,528 --> 02:25:00,672
Totally text step 3

2842
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:04,256
There is like there is that Colonel of like

2843
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:05,280
I think

2844
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,304
If I were out

2845
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:07,584
2009

2846
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:09,376
And I didn't

2847
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:11,424
A mole at

2848
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:15,264
Yeah I would probably

2849
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,800
Adjust Bank online

2850
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:18,336
She has to do a TV

2851
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:19,872
He's not going to

2852
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:24,736
King Soopers

2853
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:30,880
Say 4 hours plus whatever discretionary time. In order to broadcast

2854
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:32,928
The reality of the situation

2855
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:36,256
Just going to respond to the most

2856
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:37,536
Popular internet

2857
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:42,912
What are the most popular

2858
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:44,448
FEMA camps

2859
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:47,008
I wouldn't

2860
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:48,032
I think if there's any

2861
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:48,800
Threat

2862
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:51,104
There is just enough

2863
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,128
A necessity

2864
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,152
To do

2865
02:25:56,224 --> 02:26:01,344
Right there's no there's no threat

2866
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,112
Episode

2867
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:05,440
He could have run a whole long list of like

2868
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:06,720
Glenn Beck

2869
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:13,120
Point and then I'm going to deflect away from it and do that I would argue that

2870
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:15,424
Necessary

2871
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,984
It makes way more sense than to

2872
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:24,384
Preemptively be wrong at not wrong about his predictions about what Glenn Beck is going

2873
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:26,176
Stay

2874
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:32,320
Preemptively

2875
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:35,648
If I were his like advisor I was like his wormtongue I be like

2876
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:39,232
We got to stop don't worry about the

2877
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:40,768
We got to stop giving him advice

2878
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:45,376
Even even in 2009 we got to stop

2879
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,912
For so long

2880
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:48,448
Don't even worry about this put on some

2881
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:49,216
Some sunglasses

2882
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:49,984
Just be like

2883
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:52,032
Get drunk in studio

2884
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:53,056
And just be like

2885
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:59,456
Hold on 28

2886
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,736
2018 Alex

2887
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:02,784
Take The High Ground of just

2888
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,576
Being cooler than him

2889
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:07,136
Can't prove your point

2890
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:10,464
It's been demonstrated because they're not true

2891
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:15,840
Part of that problem

2892
02:27:16,096 --> 02:27:18,912
Serious problem for your argument

2893
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:21,984
Don't try triple Lindy

2894
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:25,056
Land it that's that's kind of the argument I'm

2895
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:27,360
I would make

2896
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:30,432
I feel like you just invalidated cool

2897
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:32,224
I feel like Alex

2898
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:34,272
Is now the Jamaican vibes

2899
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:35,040
Bobsled team

2900
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:36,576
And you are ruining

2901
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,136
Here's the problem with your metaphor

2902
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:45,536
Those people

2903
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:47,072
UPN a bobsled team

2904
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:53,472
The reason no one said that it was absurd to think they could not be

2905
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:54,240
Because they

2906
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:58,848
Have the goods they could run there were like

2907
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:03,968
Wheeled cart all of the relevant skills

2908
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:04,992
Possible

2909
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,296
I don't

2910
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:08,832
I think that Alex just

2911
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:10,368
The good

2912
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:13,952
0

2913
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:16,256
I know that I'm just like

2914
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:17,536
Here's the problem

2915
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:19,072
Yeah what's the problem

2916
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:21,632
Took my problem is like

2917
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:23,680
I think that I think that

2918
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,264
Real life

2919
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:30,336
And all that but

2920
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:32,896
There's so much more in all

2921
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:33,920
Cut out all the stuff

2922
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:35,200
Just

2923
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:37,760
Ransom

2924
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:40,320
Yeah

2925
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:41,600
I just

2926
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:44,928
We Have Heard

2927
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,744
Like literally

2928
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,512
We've heard enough

2929
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,560
And that's why I'm getting really

2930
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:53,120
What about this

2931
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:57,984
It's because Alex has done an hour and 20 minutes

2932
02:28:58,240 --> 02:28:59,520
Of talking about his

2933
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:00,288
Defensive

2934
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:02,848
And all we've heard is him

2935
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,384
Moving the goalposts

2936
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:07,712
You know mentioning

2937
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:10,528
Executive orders that he got from us

2938
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:16,416
Fear chain email right we've heard news stories that are about different

2939
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:17,952
Not about

2940
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:19,488
He's talking about

2941
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,072
A couple of oblique references to the Iran-Contra scandal

2942
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:25,376
We've heard the citizen

2943
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:26,400
Pavilion

2944
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:27,936
Labor program

2945
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:28,704
The different cops

2946
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:29,984
Having

2947
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:36,640
None of this is real. The fact that you're putting together

2948
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:39,200
Damning indictment of the fact

2949
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:44,320
Is going to come off as though it was

2950
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:52,256
In such a way that it looks like I'm wrestling with that right now

2951
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:55,840
A hundred percent

2952
02:29:57,632 --> 02:30:00,448
I think that

2953
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:03,264
If this was your

2954
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,568
Look you have done

2955
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,296
This was your moment

2956
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:18,880
Suddenly betray all of our trucks

2957
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:23,232
It would be a real real coup d'etat

2958
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,256
The only

2959
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:30,656
Phasing f****** turn for you if you would he'll turn on Hollywood Hogan

2960
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:36,288
Folding pocket aces for two years of the goddamn World Series of Poker

2961
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:40,896
Lego

2962
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:41,664
Yeah

2963
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:45,760
Kevin Nash

2964
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:52,928
People like wrestling references and I haven't

2965
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:53,696
Bring this up

2966
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:55,744
For me I honestly think

2967
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,048
This is maybe a like

2968
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:01,376
An episode of our show

2969
02:31:01,888 --> 02:31:04,960
But this is a varsity level episode of Alex

2970
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:07,264
Perez needs to be

2971
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:08,288
You come correct

2972
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:10,080
And I don't want anyone

2973
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:13,408
Like I know that I am

2974
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:15,712
Coming back with you articulated perfectly

2975
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,272
I hacked

2976
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:19,040

2977
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:19,808
I'm not

2978
02:31:20,064 --> 02:31:22,368
The stuff that is not included in the clip

2979
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:24,160
Is so boring

2980
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:25,440
Stupid nonsense

2981
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:26,720
Of him just Randy

2982
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:29,280
Randomly referencing dumb s***

2983
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:34,912
That isn't specific all the stuff like document

2984
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:37,472
So we get to this point

2985
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:39,264
And Alex says this

2986
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,032
Which

2987
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:40,800

02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,904
Representing what civilian

3009
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:34,464
It's a non-military

3010
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:35,744
Employees that work for the

3011
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,024
Department

3012
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,048
Vacay

3013
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:42,656
Drafted

3014

Essential Personnel can be made to go overseas

3015
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:50,592
Working art

3016
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:52,128
Aaron Lewis

3017
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:52,896
Freak

3018
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:54,944
Call Jessica

3019
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:55,968
But also

3020
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:00,320
If you don't want to

3021
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:02,880
It's a job

3022
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:05,696
The part of the

3023
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:06,976
Department

3024
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:09,280
Yep do it's not forcing you into a

3025
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:11,840
CID

3026
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:12,864
First of all

3027
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:16,448
Is a misunderstanding

3028
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:17,472
Civilian

3029
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:20,032
Events

3030
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:21,568
Are you kidding me

3031
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:24,128
The f****** idea that

3032
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:24,896
To create something

3033
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:31,040
Is the army

3034
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:33,088
Of our country

3035
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:35,136
The biggest most-funded army

3036
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:36,672
Yeah in the world

3037
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:38,208
We're going to create a

3038
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:42,304
Times that Obama's hold on

3039
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:44,096
Excuse me colonel

3040
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:45,120
Foxface

3041
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:50,496
I'm not going to do your f****** dirty

3042
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:51,776
I quit

3043
02:34:55,616 --> 02:34:57,152
Really how it works

3044
02:34:57,408 --> 02:35:03,552
I think it is just role-played exactly okay well I mean I could still use

3045
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:05,088
Paycheck though so like

3046
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:08,416
Can you resend me your best

3047
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:16,608
Personnel

3048
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:19,936
Positioned slightly

3049
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,704
Essential

3050
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:25,056
You have to take a pay cut probably

3051
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,616
I mean

3052
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:29,920
Principles do demand that I

3053
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:30,944
Move Department

3054
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:32,736
Is that cool

3055
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:35,040
Oh okay

3056
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:40,160
So he's not on the level

3057
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:41,952
Okay well then can I

3058
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:43,232
Go back to my old job

3059
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:44,512
Yeah

3060
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:50,912
Sure I'm not an improv guy

3061
02:35:51,168 --> 02:35:56,032
And that literal one.

3062
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:58,592
I think what's really interesting

3063
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,872
Sing about that last clip

3064
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:01,408
Is that you can tell

3065
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,432
Beginning of it at

3066
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:06,784
Like right

3067
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:07,808
I have done it

3068
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:11,136
I've made this clear I've shown you all this stuff

3069
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:12,928
And you show anybody

3070
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:17,536
His pride and how spectacularly wrong

3071
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:18,560
Is

3072
02:36:18,816 --> 02:36:19,840
Admirable

3073
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,632
In a certain sense

3074
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:24,960
Cause of how bad

3075
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:33,408
Something

3076
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:34,176
Slim

3077
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:36,224
He has brought

3078
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:37,504
Nothing

3079
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:39,040
So here is the last

3080
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:40,832
Alex makes it close

3081
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:43,392
I think that this is a

3082
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:51,328
But I got surprised to hear all

3083
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:52,864
Because what

3084
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:58,240
Talk about that murder episode

3085
02:36:58,752 --> 02:37:00,288
And how that relates to Alex

3086
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:04,896
Talking about the FEMA camps top you are so good at bringing the hammer

3087
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,432
You can read

3088
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,576
Army regulation

3089
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:18,464
Right now

3090
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:19,232
I did that

3091
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:26,400
What do I get

3092
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:32,544
I get The Raw Story

3093
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:35,360
It says

3094
02:37:42,016 --> 02:37:48,160
Prisonplanet US troops in Homeland

3095
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:03,520
Silver is Mankind's oldest natural antibiotic

3096
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:05,568
I left

3097
02:38:06,592 --> 02:38:08,640
It's not my fault it's your fault

3098
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:10,688
He's what is all comes

3099
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:13,760
That is what you trying to express

3100
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:15,040
Even when

3101
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:17,088
Debunking of

3102
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:18,112
Glenn Beck

3103
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:22,208
Supposed debunker of the FEMA camps

3104
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:25,792
It's still just on some level 8 defensive like

3105
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:27,840
I don't want to feel bad

3106
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:31,424
Did not expect you to drop that

3107
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:35,008
I didn't expect it to happen

3108
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:39,616
So what just happened was this entire rambling

3109
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:40,640
Nonsense

3110
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:42,176
Nanja bunking

3111
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:46,528
Somebody else's

3112
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:52,672
Was really about him justifying himself not being the cause of the murder of three

3113
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:55,232
I mean I don't think it was meant to be

3114
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,096
But

3115
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:01,632
Like that to me was

3116
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:06,752
Like much more revealing than anything red in the axles

3117
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:13,152
Yeah

3118
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:14,688
Cops

3119
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:17,248
Like maybe the

3120
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:18,016
Keyboard apps

3121
02:39:18,272 --> 02:39:21,344
Control a lot longer than we realize cuz like that

3122
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:24,160
Hilarious because that's a Wipeout

3123
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:29,536
I imagined been like 15 different guys who have worked

3124
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:31,328
And every time

3125
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,096
He's like okay

3126
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:35,168
I'm going to let you train the next guy

3127
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:36,192
I know you were

3128
02:39:36,448 --> 02:39:36,960
Resigned

3129
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:38,752
Stay on for another couple weeks

3130
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:39,520
Extreme the next

3131
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:41,568
And the entire two weeks has been being like

3132
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,336
Okay so he

3133
02:39:45,408 --> 02:39:46,944
What year is it

3134
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:48,480
This one is

3135
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:49,504
Whack

3136
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:50,272
Do

3137
02:39:51,808 --> 02:39:52,320
Block Rocker

3138
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:55,648
Curvy

3139
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:57,184
Pausing a lot

3140
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:57,952
Block Rockin

3141
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,024
Give me that he's failing

3142
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:03,072
Rowan

3143
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:05,888
Everyone listening

3144
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:08,704
There's like a flowchart guide

3145
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:09,472
Looked

3146
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:11,520
John with the clips

3147
02:40:12,032 --> 02:40:12,800
We're done with his like

3148
02:40:13,312 --> 02:40:14,080
Whatever it is

3149
02:40:14,848 --> 02:40:16,128
I mean I don't know

3150
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:18,176
I don't know what to say about this like

3151
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:19,968
Write this is like

3152
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:22,528
Hate to use our

3153
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:23,808
What is own cosmology

3154
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:26,624
Colonel Travis at the Alamo

3155
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:29,952
Cloister himself

3156
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:32,000
Mobile

3157
02:40:33,024 --> 02:40:36,608
Yeah but himself into a bubble

3158
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:37,888
Like his

3159
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:41,984
The only evidence

3160
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:42,752
He was able to

3161
02:40:43,008 --> 02:40:43,776
Provide

3162
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:44,800
Veryable

3163
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:47,360
It's all

3164
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:48,128
Nonsense

3165
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:49,152
It's all s***

3166
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:50,432
Or misdirection

3167
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:53,760
The idea of the civilian labor

3168
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:54,528
Kroger

3169
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:58,112
Real and that the conversation we all should

3170
02:40:58,368 --> 02:40:58,880
Buckingham

3171
02:40:59,648 --> 02:41:00,672
But the

3172
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:06,816
He's not having to write

3173
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:07,840
Conversation about that

3174
02:41:08,096 --> 02:41:09,888
So even the things that are true

3175
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:11,680
AR

3176
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:13,216
Miscues

3177
02:41:15,008 --> 02:41:15,520
IComfort

3178
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:22,176
You failed you failed

3179
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:22,944
When

3180
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:23,712
Dismount

3181
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:25,504
The laughing

3182
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:26,272
You say

3183
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:28,320
After this arambol

3184
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:29,344
Break

3185
02:41:30,368 --> 02:41:31,136
Yeah

3186
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:31,904
Yeah

3187
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:37,536
Parting shot

3188
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:39,840
It's not my fault

3189
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:40,864
It's your fault

3190
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:42,144
Yeah that's sort of

3191
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:45,984
I don't think

3192
02:41:46,496 --> 02:41:47,776
I don't think that that's where it

3193
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:51,360
You was trying to do this for at least

3194
02:41:51,872 --> 02:41:53,152
Like trying to do

3195
02:41:53,664 --> 02:41:54,176
Like I'm going to

3196
02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:56,736
Debunked

3197
02:41:58,528 --> 02:41:59,296
I wanted him

3198
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:00,832
F******

3199
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:02,624
Because I wanted

3200
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:03,392
A good

3201
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:04,416
Gladiator

3202
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:05,696
To meet me

3203
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:08,256
I want

3204
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:11,328
I love this pic you wanted to test yourself against the best

3205
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:13,632
I love you

3206
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:14,912
And I love this

3207
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:15,936
I love what we do

3208
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:17,472
I wanted

3209
02:42:17,984 --> 02:42:18,752
This episode

3210
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:20,544
Alex Jones

3211
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:21,568
Nose to the

3212
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:22,848
Keystone right

3213
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:25,152
He is just

3214
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:27,200
Working is

3215
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:29,504
Trying to make sure

3216
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:35,904
Did you know that he is never been lying about FEMA camp and it's all f****** true

3217
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:37,440
From the jump

3218
02:42:37,696 --> 02:42:39,744
As soon as he started talking about it

3219
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:40,512
It's like

3220
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:48,448
The National Security Council and the department of national security problem

3221
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:51,776
Is

3222
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:53,824
Just miss representation

3223
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,872
Why like I wanted

3224
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:57,408
Even if you got off to that pic

3225
02:42:59,200 --> 02:42:59,712
Okay

3226
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:05,600
Fifa.com is ruled by the National Security

3227
02:43:06,112 --> 02:43:06,624
I would have

3228
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:07,392
Forgiving it

3229
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:09,952
If the other things he was saying we're like

3230
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:11,488
Some sort of

3231
02:43:11,744 --> 02:43:12,768
Proof of his cancer

3232
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,096
It started bad

3233
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:17,120
Middle bad

3234
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:18,144
Nick finished bad

3235
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:19,680
This is like a bad

3236
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:20,704
Comedy

3237
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,472
Shut up

3238
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:22,240
That you go to

3239
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:23,520
Iraq

3240
02:43:24,288 --> 02:43:24,800
No

3241
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:31,200
No

3242
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:33,504
Goddamn point man I was going to what

3243
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:39,392
Wrong that's not the right way to do things but Thursday

3244
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:50,400
You know like that's what you wanted Alex to have

3245
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:54,752
His motivation

3246
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:57,056
Play Sublime

3247
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:00,640
I get it

3248
02:44:02,176 --> 02:44:05,248
And we can have a more robust conversation about that other than

3249
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:06,272
He's wrong about this

3250
02:44:06,528 --> 02:44:07,808
He's wrong about that

3251
02:44:08,064 --> 02:44:09,088
It was so easy

3252
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:10,112
The show that

3253
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:12,160
The only thing that

3254
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:14,208
I think if we look back

3255
02:44:16,768 --> 02:44:18,048
Marginally interested

3256
02:44:20,096 --> 02:44:20,864
Governors

3257
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:23,424
Having power over the National Guard

3258
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:28,288
Which I think is a really weirdly specific thing for us to be like

3259
02:44:29,312 --> 02:44:33,664
I have conflicting

3260
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:36,224
FEMA camp in

3261
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:40,576
Well the separation of powers is

3262
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:47,232
Civilian labor camps others like a hundred percent.

3263
02:44:57,472 --> 02:44:59,008
Alex you're on the wrong side of this year

3264
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:00,288
Are they talking about

3265
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:04,128
Crazy to me

3266
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:05,152
It's crazy

3267
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:06,176
I know I

3268
02:45:06,432 --> 02:45:08,224
I recognize this as I'm saying

3269
02:45:08,736 --> 02:45:09,248
I know

3270
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:10,272
Did everyone listening

3271
02:45:11,552 --> 02:45:12,064
8D

3272
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:12,832
Deeply deeply

3273
02:45:13,344 --> 02:45:13,856
F***** up for me

3274
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:15,392
Bestowed

3275
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:17,952
You like it so f***** up

3276
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:21,536
I know I don't know why

3277
02:45:21,792 --> 02:45:23,584
Keeps

3278
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:27,424
It's crazy

3279
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:29,728
It's crazy that I still hold out hope

3280
02:45:29,984 --> 02:45:35,104
It it's behind it's it's it's that

3281
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:38,944
If there's some there's some part of me that thinks there's like

3282
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:39,968
Stop

3283
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:44,320
He's going to tomorrow he's going to get it right

3284
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:45,600
He's not Alec

3285
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:47,904
Idiot

3286
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:50,976
Do you think racist

3287
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:56,352
And that's never going to change

3288
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:57,632
I think it's

3289
02:45:57,888 --> 02:45:59,168
He so often

3290
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:00,448
Talks about topic

3291
02:46:00,704 --> 02:46:01,472
Text that we're alike

3292
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,775
If you would just

3293
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:05,823
If you would

3294
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:06,847
Cuz it's not

3295
02:46:07,871 --> 02:46:12,735
It's not far from his narrative it's not it's if you just

3296
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:19,135
If you would just turn it from like this thing to like not even 180° to 10 degrees in the

3297
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:20,159
Direction

3298
02:46:20,415 --> 02:46:21,695
All the sudden Gap

3299
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:24,255
Everyone's having a conversation about

3300
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:25,023
Slavery

3301
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:26,047
Which is what

3302
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:27,839
We still allow

3303
02:46:28,095 --> 02:46:30,655
You know if you would just

3304
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:32,191
It's not a lot it's not a

3305
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:40,127
Close but instead you're like

3306
02:46:40,383 --> 02:46:41,151
Safe

3307
02:46:41,407 --> 02:46:43,967
Harbor Freight near me

3308
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:46,271
Jordan

3309
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:47,551
This is our last episode

3310
02:46:48,063 --> 02:46:49,343
And I'd like to say thank you

3311
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:50,111
Everyone

3312
02:46:50,623 --> 02:46:51,391
Listen to our podcast

3313
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:56,511
May this year

3314
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:57,279
End of

3315
02:46:57,535 --> 02:46:58,047
28

3316
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:02,399
It's completely

3317
02:47:03,935 --> 02:47:05,215
There's a lot of people who are on

3318
02:47:05,471 --> 02:47:05,983
Bored

3319
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:07,263
A year ago

3320
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:08,287
Who are still there

3321
02:47:08,543 --> 02:47:09,311
I love you

3322
02:47:09,823 --> 02:47:10,335
We appreciate

3323
02:47:10,591 --> 02:47:11,103
You so much

3324
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:12,895
Interview jokes

3325
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:18,527
Look it's crazy

3326
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:20,319
How much

3327
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:21,343
I appreciate

3328
02:47:21,855 --> 02:47:22,367
How much

3329
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:23,903
Everyone is awesome

3330
02:47:25,695 --> 02:47:26,975
It's not to me

3331
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:28,255
Is it people have warm

3332
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:29,535
2 oz

3333
02:47:30,047 --> 02:47:31,071
Because our show is some

3334
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:33,375
Looking stupid

3335
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:34,655
The ideas

3336
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:35,935
You and I sit around

3337
02:47:37,983 --> 02:47:39,519
And I appreciate that so very much

3338
02:47:40,287 --> 02:47:40,799
Does

3339
02:47:43,103 --> 02:47:43,615
I can't

3340
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:44,895
This year

3341
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:45,663
Without

3342
02:47:46,431 --> 02:47:46,943
From

3343
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:49,759
You all

3344
02:47:53,599 --> 02:47:54,367
You make this all work

3345
02:47:54,623 --> 02:47:55,135
Worthwhile

3346
02:47:55,647 --> 02:47:57,183
Because if I were sitting around

3347
02:47:57,439 --> 02:47:58,207
I'm just researching

3348
02:47:59,999 --> 02:48:01,023
Anyways to talk about him

3349
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:08,447
Deeply depressing which you would do without their shell

3350
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:14,079
By the first three months of our show where almost nobody was listening

3351
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:19,199
If we had never met you would still be doing freezing point but it would just be about Alex

3352
02:48:19,455 --> 02:48:24,063
You would be gone probably if things have gone pretty well you would be gone

3353
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:25,599
And I would be talking to

3354
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:27,647
Hulu app

3355
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:30,719
I appreciate it

3356
02:48:31,231 --> 02:48:34,303
This is this is

3357
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:35,071
In some way

3358
02:48:38,143 --> 02:48:38,911
Reming the year

3359
02:48:39,167 --> 02:48:39,679
2019

3360
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:43,775
Thank you to everyone

3361
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:45,311
Thank you for listening

3362
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:47,615
Thank you for

3363
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:49,407
Changing my life

3364
02:48:49,663 --> 02:48:50,175
And a very

3365
02:48:50,431 --> 02:48:51,199
Specific way

3366
02:48:51,711 --> 02:48:57,855
And

3367
02:48:58,111 --> 02:48:59,391
I have gas

3368
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:03,999
You gave me gout

3369
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:08,095
It because of Alex Jones I have

3370
02:49:08,351 --> 02:49:10,655
Gout well I should also

3371
02:49:10,911 --> 02:49:11,423
Vapors

3372
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:13,215
What is gout

3373
02:49:13,727 --> 02:49:15,007
Also I'm hanging out with

3374
02:49:15,263 --> 02:49:17,055
The Whispers Gaslight Lake

3375
02:49:17,567 --> 02:49:18,079
Uric acid

3376
02:49:19,871 --> 02:49:22,175
Here's the deal

3377
02:49:22,431 --> 02:49:23,455
Everyone out there

3378
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:24,991
Romans

3379
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:27,295
Countryman

3380
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:29,855
We will be back

3381
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:31,647
Next episode button

3382
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,927
Until then I will say

3383
02:49:36,255 --> 02:49:37,791
What is a nihilist

3384
02:49:38,303 --> 02:49:38,815
Alright

3385
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:39,839
Okay hold on

3386
02:49:40,095 --> 02:49:40,863
So we have

3387
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:45,215
Which you were going to release

3388
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:46,751
The wiki

3389
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:50,335
Pictures of

3390
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:52,895
Honestly by the
