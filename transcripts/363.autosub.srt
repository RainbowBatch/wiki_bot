00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,448
Have you ever been trapped in a snowstorm

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008

Yeah like like trapped outside not like crap in your apartment by a lot of storm

8
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
A I think I meant like

00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
Snowpocalypse Chicago for that

10
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
Right

11
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
There's one time there was a really

12
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
Terrible blizzard

13
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Number of

14
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Is back

Real f******

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
I wanted to get out of the house

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
And

19
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Good buddy

00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
Neighbor has worked at a bar called

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
I believe it was

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
Dukes

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
And you know.

Snowden he's at the bar all of the buddies are going over there to just drink at a bar

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,808
I feel like it was the day of the Super Bowl

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,696
B b mixing up the memories

28
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
The bar it'll be

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Be great

30
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
And so Mike yeah that's it I'll get stuck in there

31
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
5 Steps outside

32
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
No f****** way

33
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
Nah is my back inside and

34
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Aniwatch

35
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
YouTube

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
Yeah I know I don't know I don't mind the idea of getting snowed in

37
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
You're mentioning this because we're having our first

38
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
Real snow of the Season here in

39
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,768
The Chicagoland area are the kind where the

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
It is it is

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,888
Believes having fallen off though so all the trees that were like

42
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
20 ft tall and I'm 5 ft

43
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984
There's a nice view out my window.

44
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Tree covered in

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Snow

46
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
Very idyllic it looks like like

47
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,152
Box boxing bags

48
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
Celestial Seasonings ass

49
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
I blow out the window

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
It looks to me a little bit like there should be.

51
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Teenagers throwing snowballs out there

52
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,792
Play before they go fight in World War 1

53
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
I was outside met up with a friend blast

54
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Last night for a drink

55
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
Uber

56
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
The guy was talking about

57
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
I was telling me about how like

58
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
Going to snow tomorrow I realize I'm so out of touch

59
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Like whether the world

60
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
That was happening

61
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Like almost

62
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Iocus

63
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
Snow in inches of snow a foot I don't give a s*** come home at all

64
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Very strange

65
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
They strange

66
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
Anyway I don't have to be

67
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,312
Concerned about snow that much given my normal lifestyle now but

68
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Fbe concerned about Alex

69
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
And I guess I have to be concerned about

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
A little bit

71
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,320
Looking into the present-day of Alex Jones

72
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,160
I've have been Talkin Bout Time Travelers APAC

73
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
Ogive time-traveling ourselves

74
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
This week

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
Mindy and we've not checked in on what Alex's dumbass is up to

76
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
So

77
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
I assume he's protecting Deadspin writers that's all he's doing right free speech

78
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,871
Curiously absent

79
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,199
Doesn't seem to care at all

80
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
29

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
I wanted to cover a wider

82
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Span of time but it's

83
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Not possible given

84
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
The Bangles

85
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
And I'll talk about that a little bit here in a moment

86
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
But before we get to that

87
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463

You're out there listening and you're thinking I'd enjoy the show I'd like to support the show with

These guys do support if I go to a website knowledge.com is Betances for the show we would appreciate

108
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
So Jordan like I said we're doing the 30th

109
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Wednesday of this

110
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,551
So on the 29th Alex's going on about just trying to

111
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Like basically get estate

112
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
I thought about covering

113
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
That Anna I looked into

114
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Do a lot of that

115
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
What I realized is we talked about a lot of that alright

116
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Yeah it's very

117
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
The same thing

118
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Talk about over and over and over and over again

119
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
And so much as I think it's important

120
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Keep an eye on that

121
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
The way that you use

122
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
You know increasingly and

123
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,991
Consistently calling his enemies devils and demons back to the same things that happened

124
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
In the early to mid 80s

125
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Martin

126
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Preschool casein

127
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
Now these things again about it we never ever ever ever will not ever

128
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Is rhetoric and other stuff

129
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Is very the same

130
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
I think it's important to

131
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Make a note of

132
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
But this is a lot of the stuff he's doing

133
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
But

134
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
I don't know how important it is to really

135
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Dwelling it

136
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,895
I mean I think I can sum it up usually with just hey you know those marginalized groups

137
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,735
Not only should they remain marginalized but it's their fault they're marginally

138
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
And we should marginalize them further or Satan

139
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Yes exactly

140
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
That's kind of what's going on in on the 29th

141
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
A.m.

142
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Keeping an eye on

143
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
It develops if there's a change

144
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Escalation

145
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Worthwhile to

146
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
The point out but I believe that the 30th

147
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Is X

148
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Actually far more

149
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Irrelevant

150
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Do Trenton

151
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
That we are seeing in Alex's show

152
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
That are are much scared

153
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Okay

154
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
I meant so

155
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Will we get over the course of this

156
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Episode is

157
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
So pretty pretty f*****-up white nationalism

158
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
To surprise you in the room now

159
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Just you and us

160
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Iuc

161
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Some things happening on this Epic

162
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Episode that I think are

163
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,119
Exactly what would you predict would happen on Alex's show exactly the directions

164
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
He's been going in for a while

165
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
But you still really

166
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Don't like

167
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Yeah they're going to start here in this

168
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
This first clip

169
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
He's addressing these new clip

170
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
Should have come out of Barack Obama

171
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
Saying that's a hey you know wokeness

172
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Advocacy

173
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Oh boy here we go

174
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
Here we go about that

175
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,511
Would be completely different because there's also a clip of

176
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Michelle Obama

177
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Let's come out

178
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
That is only rule of the right

179
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
So here is the first close

180
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
That talkin about

181
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Clips from the

182
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:52,223
And they're also telling you that we're on the verge of a global race war because white people

183
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
Are inherently evil and bad

184
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
But everyone's trying to get into countries

185
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Founded and that were Ryan

186
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
By the dreaded

187
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
White people

188
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Very interesting

189
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
I'm fact here's Obama

190
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
Telling us that wokeness is not activism and then

191
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Maybe he hasn't heard his wife's out doing

192
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,799
Spilling some of the biggest black KKK stuff you've ever heard

193
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,407
Obama talking about families

194
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Is being

195
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,039
The same whether they're immigrants or

196
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
Akka

197
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Cool talking about the one where she's like

198
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
White people moved away from Black

199
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Yeah yeah yeah

200
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Because

201
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
That was literally

202
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,655
White people moved away from black people against the law to move closer

203
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
Studies have been done about self-segregation

204
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
And the phenomenon that's a happen

205
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
About you now

206
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
Do white people on a macro scale

207
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
The way that Society

208
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
Cities have readjusted a lot of it is

209
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
White flower

210
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
But bedtime

211
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
You know

212
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
The countries founded by white p

213
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
People is little disingenuous

214
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
Oh well

215
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
White always has been in

216
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Exclusionary light

217
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
The idea of whiteness

218
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Has always been used

219
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
People out in the ways that label was applied

220
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
The inlets are the late 1700s

221
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
It's certainly different than it is

222
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Today

223
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
Concepts of whiteness of

224
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Revolved

225
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Svr

226
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
More or less

227
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,831
Spoke to the people wielding those ideas right

228
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Kind of silly.

229
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
To say that

230
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
Well well dream of bounded by y p

231
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Before they found his car

232
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
Protestant white people are Catholic white people

233
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Because they used to kill each other all the

234
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
Time where they routed by the Irish founded by the Italians

235
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
Zach even later periods of America's his

236
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,151
No it seems like the white is a is a term that includes

237
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
As the exclusionary Group Change

238
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
Yeah and whatever you needed to be that what it is

239
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,831
So it's always a little bit disingenuous

240
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
The heaviest like

241
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Everyone wants to get into the

242
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
These countries founded by white people

243
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Alright whatever

244
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Anyway he's mad at Michelle Obama cuz she

245
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:18,399
Is black KKK no different than the Immigrant families that are moving in the families in Pilsen the

246
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,543
The families that are coming from other places to try to do better

247
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
Because we can so easily wash over who we really were because of the color of our skin

248
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Tell because of the

249
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
The texture of our hair

250
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
You know that's what divides countries

251
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
Artificial is artificial things that don't come on now

252
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,423
Call the world with no skills training

253
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
You're pushing is a anti-white anti-American agenda

254
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,175
Everybody knows what you're up to you evil witch believable

255
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,527
Broad anti-white anti-American agenda

256
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
Interesting phrase anyway that the those two being so close together with

257
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Appoint any larger issue

258
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
Very over I can understand which is very over

259
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Strawmanning of what

260
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
She saying

261
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Changing it into a

262
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
Yeah you see this

263
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
In the

264
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Beginning of the episode

265
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
And it's

266
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,943
Yeah that's how we hoping yeah I was listening to this I was like

267
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
OD

268
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,783
Dear God what is going to happen on this episode

269
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
This is

270
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Really f***** up and it's not even like

271
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
It's not even like as anti-American

272
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
, anti-white cuz that means

273
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,559
A whole different than that means very similar things

274
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,631
Anti-white then, anti-American is very much like

275
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
White purse

276
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
That's what's important

277
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
And then naturally

278
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
But thing is it like Michelle

279
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
She knows what used

280
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Evil

281
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Evil evil evil evil

282
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Did you go back to

283
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,671
John D Rockefeller the first you go back to Margaret Sanger Planned Parenthood

284
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
The Colgate family

285
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
And others are public

286
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
Paris letters

287
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,007
And she was given billions of dollars billions back

288
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
I'd be Huntersville yesterday

289
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
So it's not

290
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,199
Not true of all the black leaders and black colleges

291
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
The Christians are set up they hijacked

292
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
The madman what you see this

293
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Is the plan

294
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Everybody

295
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,999
So you can look at the master black communities in Bible

296
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
I get mad at a butt

297
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
We're smart enough to really know the full gameplay

298
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
And I buy into this race war crap

299
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
How about we do that

300
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Because the whole thing

301
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Is a

302
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Shut up

303
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,735
You could easily hear this very similar rhetoric being used as anti civil rights

304
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,807
Ciara

305
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,183
These are black people who want to be able to eat at the same counter is me and I was white

306
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,071
I just don't know we're above that kind of whatever it is they're doing

307
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
I know you and I the whites

308
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:34,495
We're above that we're not going to get down in the dirty with all that jazz music

309
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
Haven't we talked about them are grits

310
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
The number of times

311
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
But at least the dollars is a billion dollars Sanger with hundreds of billions of dollars they needed to pay

312
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
I heard to come in and co-opted all this stuff we learned me because

313
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
Things to help Empower people butts

314
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,631
But they are all susceptible to billions of dollars a payoff putting an IV evil

315
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Genocide

316
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Margaret Sanger

317
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Oh yeah

318
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
Anyway Alex starts rambling

319
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Some more about towel

320
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Like his body

321
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
They have this

322
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Supernatural

323
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Right and that's what the enemy is jealous

324
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
Okay once you get the big agenda

325
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
The same thing

326
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
To the same thing you say like an hour later

327
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
You tweeted this

328
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
For speech

329
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
They said exactly what you said he said during the speech

330
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
We're simpatico

331
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
And that

332
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
Globalist looks at me and he just shook his head.

333
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Works

334
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
They're mad

335
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
We've got a sixth sense way more powerful than them

336
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Do you serve evil you lose the gift-giving

337
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
You get staytonville Twista

338
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Yep

339
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
The literal superpowers

340
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
The god-given

341
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
Superpowers are literal

342
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
Right2know which one

343
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Subaru

344
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,423
Super 6 in all right so I'll pass on that

345
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,287
I'm willingly given that one up Ono

346
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
I'm just going to let that one go

347
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
What next

348
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
What am I missing out

349
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,271
Magnises cuz I don't give a s*** if I can tell you what Trump is going to save 5 minutes

350
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
Yeah that's a bad power

351
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:32,511
I would rather Bruce Willis no dumb thing

352
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,607
Oh I know what a white racist is going to say

353
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,447
Yeah I would if it was telekinesis or flying

354
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Hell yeah

355
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,799
I believe in any God that lets me fly predicting

356
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Because Alex has believe it

357
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Power

358
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
He's talking about that you know the big

359
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Agenda

360
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
Continuation of his thoughts

361
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
About Margaret Sanger in this

362
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
Does Eugenics plan the globalist have

363
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Once you see all that you see

364
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
See you at all when you get superpowers that God gives you the ability to talk about Democrat

365
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Demographic replacement

366
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,519
Call you before another guide rate superpower

367
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
So

368
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
Like you know like we have these

369
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:24,223
Powers and then Satan gives like full super powers

370
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Alright

371
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
Man I wish I was high for the

372
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
This is really entry

373
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
Because I would argue that the things that

374
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
He's talking about here

375
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
None of them are gif

376
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,303
Okay I'll explain the other side

377
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
By the way

378
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,959
We're all pretty equal in God's eyes I agree with that Russian dependents equal in our skill

379
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
I don't have to get to being a long distance Runner

380
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
But I do have a gif

381
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Fortitude and focus

382
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
And the gifts that nobody's ever knocked me out

383
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Couldn't get in the habit

384
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Lead pipe

385
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
Handles

386
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Call got

387
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Different gifts

388
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
I do not believe also

389
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
Alex's head trauma

390
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
Have a very thick skull

391
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Avakin

392
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
What what familiarity with head trauma that I have been

393
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Laminated 2

394
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
Had abuse

395
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
Even smaller than it was before

396
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
What he's saying

397
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,655
R-Truth

398
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
It's not a gift

399
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Also

400
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:55,103
Long distance running isn't necessarily A gift either you work on right

401
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Cracker

402
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
I could get much

403
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Better at longest

404
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,063
Distance running then I am right now if I applied myself that's not necessarily a gift

405
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Maybe some people are

406
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Just like by their butt

407
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
Their physical like we all have different bodies

408
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Airborne

409
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Yeah it's summer maybe more conducive towards running

410
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
And other I try right but Michael Phelps

411
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
Clearly has some sort of proportions that make him Swim Good

412
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Now if you had

413
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
Praying that no he had the gift of swimming

414
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Dad

415
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Whatever

416
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
It's 88

417
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
Discounting of the process

418
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
Yeah just pretending it's

419
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
The gift not the other thing that I would say about this

420
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,695
Alex does not have fortitude nor does he have folks

421
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
The both of us staying Focus

422
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Is

423
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Furiate

424
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
Yeah

425
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Yeah

426
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Reading week

427
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
UE

428
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
I don't even allow breathing on the way

429
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,359
That's that's too far away

430
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
I could

431
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
I would also say that those are

432
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Practice behaviors to

433
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
Like focus is something you can get better at if you apply you

434
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,855
Yourself fortitude

435
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
Fortitude another thing

436
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
And will is something that you can get better at

437
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
By making

438
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Brave decision

439
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
I think he's only talkin about fortitude in the sense that he can take a

440
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,495
I think that's mainly his idea of fortitude my basement where he goes with

441
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
Ahead

442
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
I'd like

443
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:35,199
8 that he has to have a really good saving throw to make it through that without getting

444
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Ridiculous

445
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Ridiculous

446
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
So

447
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
This attack

448
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
On Michelle Obama

449
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Is

450
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Icon

451
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Necessary

452
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,023
And stupid and it's being couched in a lot of like a very

453
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
White identity ways

454
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
Sure it is absolutely a reflect

455
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
I'm sort of an insult

456
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
Security that he feels about this

457
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
Very powerful popular black woman speaking the way that

458
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
Yeah when she talks he might as well just Screech strong black woman and then hide in the f****** corner or whatever

459
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Something

460
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Do that that you can hear that

461
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Feel it from his

462
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Response

463
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
And because he's very stupid

464
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,952
Any lacks fortitude and lacks Focus he has been hit in the head with a lead pipe

465
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
The only way he can really

466
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,304
Experience this and move forward

467
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
To make

468
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Personal

469
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Bigoted

470
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
Yeah there we go on Michelle

471
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
We're going to talk about

472
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
The real rabbit hole next segment play Somebody's clips

473
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,920
From Kanye and then that Wicked devil Michelle Obama

474
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
That

475
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Sakuraba

476
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Wife

477
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,648
Dollars in advance

478
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
Going to be talkin about

479
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
Mrs woky Wok

480
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,584
So it's business going to descend a little bit it's a human flying B

481
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
Michelle Obama secretly a man

482
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,960
Over the years

483
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,568
Covering it talking about it a bunch and then being like hey we're just joking

484
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
Just joking around and then doing

485
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,480
Sirius special reports about it

486
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
It's disgraceful

487
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Disgusting

488
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
And very dumb

489
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
And we'll go see a little bit more of it as is

490
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Reveal

491
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
A big Special Report

492
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
That he is made

493
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,144
Don't know no no accents

494
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
No I okay

495
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
But I told you already

496
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Okay

497
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
It's still happening

498
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
Cry don't worry about

499
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
I'm there's a News special report Vine

500
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,712
Final yes addressing the age-old

501
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
About flattering

502
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
I want to be completely clear I do not believe

503
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
But because the

504
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,768
People have been lied to so much and they know they've been lied to now

505
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
Most people don't know what's true and

506
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,448
They've done internal polls and actual survey

507
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,312
$20,000 is a few months ago doing one

508
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,616
What color shoes to find out example

509
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Going on

510
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
What we thought

511
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
What

512
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Question where the earth flat

513
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Something else

514
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,744
I don't know if you saying you spent $20,000 on a flat Earth pole or if it's a different pole like

515
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Sandy Hook related

516
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Public

517
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
Ian Pollard

518
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
I don't know what you're talkin about

519
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:40,032
But the legal issues leads me to believe it has to be related

520
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
About legal issue

521
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,384
The law is it who is it

522
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,712
Help you could help guide your like

523
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
How you would behave in the Press

524
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,880
Court of public opinion

525
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Okay for me to say

526
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,232
What can alienate literally everybody

527
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,304
How could I bring you some Focus

528
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Get any

529
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
Semblance of focus

530
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Guess yeah

531
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
But it's the way he's talking

532
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
You did a f****** survey about Flat Earth

533
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,616
Hilarious probably not true but based on his life

534
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,480
The focus in inability to convey information that make it that's what he's saying

535
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
Anyway I don't really care about this stupid

536
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
Flat Earth report

537
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
It's just basically about the idea that

538
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
Government slide so much that it

539
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,976
It's rational to question whether the Earth is flat

540
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
And I would say

541
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
The opposite

542
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,608
It is probably true enough people have been

543
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,888
Baby conspiracy

544
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,496
B******* so long

545
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
Okay the government does lie

546
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
And having a healthy amount of steps

547
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
He's a healthy

548
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
But it's a healthy distrust

549
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,760
As opposed to an unhealthy distrust

550
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
Which is what we see manifested over the years when Alex

551
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Right I don't understand

552
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
In what

553
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Possible sense

554
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
The government is at fault for

555
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Whatever the government does

556
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
Has anything to do with whether or not the Earth is

557
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
I think you need to look in the Flat Earth theory

558
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
Is a little bit you'll understand what

559
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
That's not

560
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,288
I think you need to educate yourself

561
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
What isn't flat your revealing the you don't know shitt

562
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
So

563
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
It's goes down over the horizon

564
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,040
Off the edge of the world

565
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
Slowly

566
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,160
I don't really care about this subject and really well versed in

567
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,560
So I don't really even want to pretend to argue for the others but I do believe that the

568
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
People who believe that the Earth is

569
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Is flat think that the government

570
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Has invested in Macon

571
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
You think that it's round

572
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
Sure sure that's the part of it the

573
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Yeah I don't

574
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Anyway I think Alex is just trying

575
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
How to reach out to

576
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
So cool good luck

577
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
I wonder if we could turn those into white magic

578
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
Easily

579
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,392
So if Alex addresses the elephant in the room

580
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
The big issue

581
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
And that is Kanye West

582
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,512
Does new album

583
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,584
To really talk Kanye West on this show

584
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,448
I assume we're going to get into the music we're going to get into some production elements

585
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,104
He's going to talk about the opening track being an accelerated version of it

586
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
Has gone back and forth on the subject of Kanye West

587
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
Depending on how insane

588
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
He's behaving

589
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,392
When he's talking about slavery being a choice Alex is like

590
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
Kanye is a genius

591
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Where do you sort of walk

592
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Slingback

593
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,376
Doesn't agree to go on Alex's show probably

594
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
Opposition

595
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,752
But now Alex has finally made a determination Kanye West

596
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,104
Is For Real

597
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,688
Yeah I'm going to go Alex Jones level on you

598
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
What is he talking about

599
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
I said Friday

600
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
Hippie comes out against the

601
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,696
Genocide of black people to pick her up my Planned Parenthood

602
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Margaret Sanger

603
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Rockefeller Foundation

604
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
That spent billions of dollars in 19

605
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,168
2034 East

606
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
The target black people first termination

607
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
Black person on Earth

608
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,136
Hillary Clinton said black men are predators have to be in prison they're like dogs bring them to heel these are quotes

609
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,464
T.i. on this podcast the millions and others

610
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,048
Hey quit telling me about Trump and racism all day and that dog whistle

611
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,424
When is the Democratic party that founded the KKK

612
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,288
You gotta talk about that

613
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
The next day he did

614
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,152
Let's talk about Alex Jones level

615
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
And the next day he talked about

616
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Today

617
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Multicultural

618
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
Today I don't want no attention on the weekend now

619
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,464
So Kanye is come outside anti-abortion and Allergy

620
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
This is proof that he is

621
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,304
Completely for real he's legit

622
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
War

623
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,704
Kanye mentioned Alex Jones and so we're going to talk about

624
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
Well that is interesting that you say that

625
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Because

626
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,360
Alex is saying that Connie you think he's going to go Alex Jones live

627
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Here's the actual clip

628
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,648
Wake up wake up mr. West wake up culture

629
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,304
Supposed to be we brainwashed out here bro

630
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
Come on man it's a free man talkin

631
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,288
Democrats how does Bolton Democrats have food stamps for Years bro

632
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,688
Was you talking about taking a plan B

633
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
It was the same shoot

634
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,488
But they don't want to even more of it

635
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,792
Planned Parenthood and the purposeful Target

636
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,656
What really is the reservation

637
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:33,312
Okay good for you

638
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
Even Kanye if the state that he's in now recognizes that Alex Jones is crazy

639
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
I am not a Luna

640
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,160
Like Alex Jones I am specifically saying I'm Alex Jones

641
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
Crazy

642
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Sample of what

643
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,816
I am not doing while people accuse me of having a bit of a

644
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Episode

645
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Then again he is doing it

646
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
Yeah it was going out

647
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,312
It's debatable exactly what going Alex Jones level meaning

648
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
And what he means

649
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,968
Hair turns gold and his Aura goes from RedTube

650
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,040
LiteBlue I would suggest that I'm not particularly interested

651
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,624
Posted what's going on with Kanye West album

652
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:25,280
Great I would say

653
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Is that

654
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
I find

655
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Some of the

656
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
Surrounding element

657
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
Of this album

658
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
2B contradict

659
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Some of the

660
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Consumerist

661
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Elements

662
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Of this

663
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,616
I find it difficult to find

664
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Verity

665
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
In

666
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,968
Someone making an album called

667
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Jesus is King

668
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
And the last album was called

669
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Yeezus

670
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
And that one of the songs

671
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Cuz I am God

672
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,184
Play God thank you very much

673
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
Hold on one moment

674
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,144
Maybe that's just my hang up but I find it to be like

675
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,192
I don't even want to dwell in this

676
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
I don't care

677
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,872
Absolute there's nothing to care about you every literate like

678
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:16,992
There are zero reviews of Jesus is King that I have read that have not been like

679
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,808
The music Here's a review of the music

680
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
It's pretty good, he's a genius

681
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:26,464
And then it's been a thousand words on how it doesn't change my opinion of Khan

682
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
Kanye's personal or public

683
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
And like okay

684
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Great

685
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,912
Still some good tracks I don't know whether I don't know what you want

686
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
No

687
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
I mean it is on one level I guess you could look at it as

688
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
What is

689
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Rashes

690
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Like artistic

691
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Move you could make

692
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
Yeah and it's to become

693
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
Kind of Fundamentalist

694
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:52,576
Aggressively fun

695
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
Kind of something

696
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Put you in a

697
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,952
The corner

698
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
He's going like

699
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,792
The Prosperity Gospel like what's your

700
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:07,424
It does feel that way

701
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,520
Had a really really good producer and was not married to a shity

702
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Like that's what it

703
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
Keyboardist

704
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
Not shity

705
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
I don't know I don't particularly care but it's awesome that Alex

706
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Alright maybe I can

707
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Can get in on this

708
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,856
He said he said Alex Jones

709
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
Granted it was in a I'm not

710
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
Going Alex Jones

711
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
I can weave my way into it

712
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
So anyway

713
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
In Spanish

714
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
What time on that bud

715
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
I'm certain he's trying to

716
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
And

717
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
I don't think it's going

718
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Probably not

719
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
But Alex needs

720
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Get back

721
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,592
Michelle Obama a lot of time

722
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Insulting

723
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
It's only place this short clip

724
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,504
Talking about the like our families are the

725
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
The same

726
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
Just be superficial differences of skin color in hair

727
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
Texture

728
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
Alden Arizona

729
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
The division

730
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
Until Alex plays that clip again and then

731
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
It starts mocking

732
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,376
Because of the the texture of our hair

733
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
You know but

734
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,336
Millions of black people

735
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
Oh mother sick which I'm not kissing your ass anymore

736
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
She wears a big old silver dollars

737
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
Some kind of big old giant king

738
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
ATS

739
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,264
It's better the family show the real

740
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
I don't I don't

741
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
I don't know how to engage

742
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,944
That's too far that's that's

743
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Two races

744
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
To transfer Robux

745
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,112
It's just too everything I did it's just beyond anything that you can engage with

746
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
You're just like

747
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
You're crazy man

748
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,488
If that's a nonsense you're going to throw out

749
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
Yep

750
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
There's a absurd and

751
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,888
Disgusting preoccupation that Alex has about this Michelle is a man

752
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm kind of thing any value in playing this is because

753
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
When

754
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
Press to the wall and when he needs

755
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
To make like criticism

756
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,968
Do people like Michelle it does seem like

757
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,576
Things that he ends up eventually having to playoff is like our just joking around

758
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
That's where is buying two ghosts

759
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
It's because he's a cruel bigot

760
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
Yeah

761
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,976
So when he's talking about Michelle one of the criticize

762
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Vicky

763
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Rises with her

764
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
Is about

765
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
Like you don't say anything about the

766
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
The rest of the world

767
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,216
Problem and I find this to be an in

768
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Interesting

769
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Primarily

770
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Because it's

771
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,152
Super white identity-based and secondarily because it's

772
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Absolutely not

773
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,480
Michelle

774
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
What you think white people are really bad

775
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,344
When the truth is modern civilization

776
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
And the end of slavery is white people doing

777
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,816
We have the moral Authority if you want to talk about

778
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,400
Africa

779
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Muslims are still selling humans in four nations in Africa can you don't say a damn word you evil

780
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
Jesus he is angry

781
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:46,048
And that is because she said that immigrants are like us

782
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:52,448
Or I can be very comfortable in saying that he's expressing overwhites

783
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
Presentation that white people have a moral

784
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Superiority

785
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Slavery

786
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
States is

787
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
This kind of mentality absolutely whitewash

788
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
Is the hard work and sacrifices of

789
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
The people who are in the abolitionist

790
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,136
Nope white people on their own

791
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,464
With no other Christmas inspiration

792
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
Many abolition

793
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,536
It's too late they gave their lives today

794
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
And this you know

795
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
It presented the

796
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Slavery it

797
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,544
White people realizing it was wrong and deciding no more of that is there at minimizing their financial struggle

798
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,944
Ancestors World turned and looked at each other and they were like guys we got a not do this whole slavery thing for and nobody

799
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,808
We just learned on her own this also seeks to minimize the brutal racist system

800
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Brought in to replace slavery after he was 10

801
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Technically abolish

802
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,208
Slavery under other names like convict leasing program

803
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Continue for quite a while

804
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
I mean it's not like prison labor isn't still being used

805
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
Exploitative Lee all over the place

806
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Today

807
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
While these programs are running

808
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:59,264
Strictly on racial lines they are extensions of a legal system that disproportionately affect

809
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
Non-white America

810
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,592
Enter pretend otherwise is

811
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
Their inmates being used to fight fires

812
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Yeah right now for

813
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,856
$2 an hour We're reminded of that every time there's a fire

814
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
Yep ever

815
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:22,304
Seems to think that just because slavery ended in the United States white people did their part and everyone should just shut up about this race stuff

816
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,120
Leaving aside for a minute that Alex f******

817
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
Heats Abraham Lincoln

818
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
And Alex's family literally thought on the side

819
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,776
Did the Confederacy during the Civil War who would have absolutely

820
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
Continue play free if they've got in their way

821
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,920
We've all had stuff on the side of the Confederacy that wanted to end slavery

822
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,992
You forget that that side of the Confederacy was there right right

823
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,808
Even leaving all that aside without you saying isn't

824
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Incredibly stupid

825
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,624
But and likes any kind of nuanced understanding

826
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
Sanding of history or the

827
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:54,816
It also seems like one of the issues that Alex has years did Michelle Obama dares to speak about race issues in the United

828
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,400
Midstates but you won't talk about slavery related issues an African country

829
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:05,312
Did Alex not remember how in May 2014 Michelle was very active in the bring that Bring Back Our Girls campaign

830
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,152
Does he not realize that that was about 300 young girls in Nigeria who are

831
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
Kidnap presumably to be traffic

832
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,576
I understand that I was only operates on sound bites he gets from White identity leading right-wing publication

833
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
We can't possibly be expect

834
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
Did actually know the work

835
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
It someone like you

836
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Michelle Obama has

837
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:25,024
It's done but he really should do is research before launching off on completely unhinged

838
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
Racist outburst

839
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
Like that I've never seen any Muslim leaders condemned Muslim Terror

840
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
Like maybe a good place for Alex

841
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,032
To start would be the July 2014

842
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,104
Speech Michelle Obama gave it to Summit of the Mandela washing

843
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Fellowship

844
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Young Africa

845
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Can l

846
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
From that speech

847
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Quote

848
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
When girls in some places

849
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Still being married off his

850
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,344
Sometimes they even before they even reach puberty

851
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,904
What female genital mutilation still continues

852
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
In some countries

853
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,000
When human trafficking rape and domestic abuse are still too,

854
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,304
And perpetrators are often faced in Oconto

855
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Address for their crime

856
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:03,168
Then we still have some serious work to do in Africa and across the globe

857
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,984
And well I have great respect for cultural differences

858
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,080
I think we can all agree that practices like genital cutting for child marriage to Messi

859
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,640
Violence are not legitimate cultural practices

860
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
They're serious human rights violation

861
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
I have no place in

862
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
Any country on this Earth

863
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:23,136
Alex is creating a fictional version of Michelle Obama turns turns a blind eye to Human Rights issues

864
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:28,256
It's slavery in African countries because she's too busy trying to demonize the white people here in America

865
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
But that doesn't match reality at all

866
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Put simply

867
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Being racist is s***

868
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:41,056
It's this isn't the valley pretty now you could make a criticism that she maybe could do more

869
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
If you want to have that conversation

870
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
Fine but pretend pretending that you dozen

871
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
Do anything or

872
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:51,040
Why you talk about that that's not true

873
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
And the reason you think

874
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Not true

875
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Because you are very

876
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,416
Angry about your white identity being

877
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
And what she does is in some way

878
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,328
Castor the same eye that you does to the African countries

879
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,144
In this sudden the speech a throughout her career

880
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
Upon you and your buddy

881
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
You f****** can't

882
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Yeah

883
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
It does seem like

884
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,360
The only people that I hear talk about how

885
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,408
Somebody is saying that white people are in

886
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Apparently bad

887
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
Are these people

888
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,624
The people who are the people who bring it up as a strawman about what other people up at the conversations that other people

889
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
I'm Not Lisa

890
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,304
It does have some of that like weird sense of of guilt trying to escape out where it's like maybe you guys are the

891
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,608
The only people who think white people are inherently bad

892
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,496
Well I would say is I think they kind of do don't they any based on all of these arguments that begin with

893
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,896
See they're saying white people are inherently bad and then goes on a Litany of all the things that white people have done and they're like

894
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:53,504
Oh just cuz we did this doesn't mean that we didn't end slavery a****** and

895
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,112
Yeah yeah I don't I don't know I I don't want to come

896
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
Because I don't actually don't know what I think

897
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,464
But what they

898
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Perceptions are

899
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
Because also it could be very easily

900
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
Plantable as like

901
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Wow their criticism

902
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:17,824
Coming our way that I rather not a dresser discussing any any meaningful

903
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
That makes sense

904
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Just as much as

905
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
I'm having a

906
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,064
Deep-seated feeling that they're evil or whatever

907
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
Probably own slaves

908
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
So he probably has some guilt towards that

909
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Maybe I don't know

910
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,976
I don't care

911
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
So not only is Alex being

912
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
Completely

913
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
Disgusting monster regarding races

914
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,912
He is also pretty deep in his

915
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Anti Trans

916
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
Stuff in lgbtq

917
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
IQ stock

918
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
Which is always at least

919
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
MedExpress

920
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
Pretty solidly

921
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
Through conflation

922
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
People in

923
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,271
Various communities the drag queen Story Time stuff

924
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
And and what have you

925
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,879
I don't care too much of that cuz

926
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,159
Mostly just

927
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
Calling calling trans people pedophiles

928
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:13,119
Variety care about that too much I just want to point this out as like a really

929
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
Example of how sloppy is f****** work

930
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:20,543
And this isn't a religion of the elite and they're really into this you see I'm pushing on your kids everywhere

931
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,615
If you guys go

932
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
Men in Drag

933
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:38,207
Normal right

934
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
Another speech

935
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
I was a very very

936
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
So that arrested Alex is talking about

937
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,287
Have nothing to do with what he's

938
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
Pretending it does

939
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,407
This is a case of a person who is wearing a wig breaking into laundry rooms

940
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,687
Stealing women's underwear

941
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,271
As best as I can tell has nothing to do with trans issues

942
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
You said has nothing to do with children

943
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,671
It's just someone using a disguise to steal underwear for laundry room was he reading the underwear

944
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
No

945
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,999
It's an invasion of these people's privacy and

946
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
Insecurities and it makes sense

947
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
Did they arrested the thief but trying to make this a part of

948
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,631
Some sort of an Anti Trans narratives

949
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
Seems a bit pathetic

950
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,031
Like the guy who is setting off Bombs all over Austin a while back he wore a wig when he went to

951
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
To the FedEx store to mail off one of his

952
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Explosives

953
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
Criminals often employ disguises to avoid

954
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,479
Detection and that seems to be what this case is

955
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:38,623
Now I don't know cuz the stories I read I don't know anything about this guy particular lady

956
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,927
To do with the larger narratives that Alex

957
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Constantly

958
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,303
Yells about from from what I can tell it has nothing to do with drag queen story time

959
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Which he's trying to

960
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Conflate

961
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
It's just a

962
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,215
Creep who's breaking into laundry Road I mean he has a problem

963
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
Since people because

964
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
There were these bank robbers

965
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:03,455
Bunch of surfer guys really really f****** out on the edge there and they wore masks whenever

966
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Break

967
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
It was arrested with 50

968
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,599
7 pairs of underwear in his car

969
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,671
Now that's a Johnny Utah level amount of underwear

970
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,255
Also you can't get arrested in California for using the wrong pronoun

971
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,351
The bill that was passed there that they're all lying about has to do with doctors

972
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,727
Care providers not being allowed to willfully use discriminatory language or behaviors with their patients

973
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
In assisted living facility

974
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,687
Alex get absolute absolutely misgender someone all he wants and have no consequences under the law unless that person where an elder

975
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Really Resident Inn

976
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Does ologist

977
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,575
The classic right-wing Bolshevik

978
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
Strawman

979
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
Man eyes

980
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
You're going that hard just to be

981
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Addicted

982
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
That's our cue really want

983
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
So Alex

984
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,887
Spent a large part of the beginning of this show really being pretty

985
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
White identity

986
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,495
Yeah and really screaming by Michelle Obama talking about how she

987
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
She's the Man

988
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:04,127
Going real hard on this

989
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,919
People do right

990
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Even though

991
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
I felt like

992
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,039
There was an intensity to at that didn't

993
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
Field that normal

994
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,719
You know it felt like he had the spirit in a little bit

995
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,327
Off the rails here today just because there's a

996
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
Here today

997
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,495
Stage one from the dreaded

998
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
That's right

999
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
Never got to this Sunday or Monday or Tuesday I'm going to do it today at 6 a.m. for next hour very serious news

1000
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
George Soros

1001
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
And we said that he could

1002
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,183
Ben the will of God

1003
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,487
Close to you

1004
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:56,095
Public defender of free speech and trumpet Alex Jones are hurting our free speech

1005
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Total

1006
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
Inversion

1007
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
Reality

1008
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,775
So he's back on his b*******

1009
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,847
Anybody could have

1010
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Some sort of

1011
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
You know Russian

1012
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,455
TV is here but it's more important

1013
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:17,343
Yeah yeah why is there a little bit story about how he's crazy

1014
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
And who knows what even me

1015
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,815
Independent YouTube channel is come with a camera

1016
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
International news

1017
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
But whatever the case is he's

1018
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,959
He's a little bit more juice stop than normal because he's

1019
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
He's performing for an audience

1020
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,335
So you see that that like screaming about Michelle Obama

1021
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Compassion

1022
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,431
Then he might normally be although he still would be worked up about those

1023
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Yeah

1024
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,271
But that you talked a lot about

1025
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,599
And it's sort of my position that I don't really care about his

1026
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,183
No absolutely not interested

1027
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,487
Sing to me whatever he's bringing up is

1028
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Bulshit

1029
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
And I don't want to get

1030
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,351
Nope but he talks about

1031
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,911
Including this clip

1032
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
Assertive tertiarily

1033
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Involved in it

1034
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
I just because he makes an accusation

1035
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
I think

1036
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,151
Okay

1037
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,967
The children

1038
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
But who's Dracula

1039
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
The Duke

1040
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,207
Girls

1041
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,351
There's a certain famous black woman is the only black person allowed to attend these meetings

1042
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,167
Does she like her little girls

1043
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
Redbox they weather

1044
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,799
What you talked about Oprah

1045
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
It's all about Oprah

1046
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Gotcha

1047
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:49,247
Clear Opera of being a pedophile

1048
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,551
Yeah that does sound like that's what he was trying to say

1049
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,599
Yep that's a hundred percent ready saying

1050
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
I don't

1051
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,415
Eventually he's got to learn the less

1052
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
Nothing about what you can and can't say

1053
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,743
I don't know people

1054
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
It's a it's a

1055
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Pretty wild

1056
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,095
I think this is deeply

1057
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,679
Possible I think he's like a dog you have to have

1058
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,007
Your negative feedback has to come immediately after the X

1059
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,871
You know that he's being punished too long after the fact he doesn't understand he doesn't

1060
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,663
Put the two together is being like

1061
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,967
I was saying this like if he just got whipped

1062
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,807
Yeah I think that's the line

1063
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,159
Yeah there's no kind of Behavioral modification possibility even with him getting

1064
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Consequences

1065
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
Cuz now he's gone

1066
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Too far

1067
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
Along with the

1068
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,303
Everyone being like whatever

1069
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,351
Yeah that's a problem

1070
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
Why we're Where We Are

1071
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,423
Marla

1072
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,263
So he starts doing this he's talking about the Dracula and

1073
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,359
And all this s*** and he starts becoming preoccupied with the globalist

1074
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
Working for Satan literal Satan

1075
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
Yes of course

1076
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,551
He dissolved devolves into a bit of a described as a wrestling

1077
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Promo

1078
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
About Satan

1079
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,671
There's one way for the globalist to get out of this Mexican

1080
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:07,071
Because you're already slaves to the devil your father you can't do it

1081
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
So there's no way out

1082
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
But it's still important

1083
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
For you

1084
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Why

1085
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
Cuz your boss has to get permission

1086
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Oh

1087
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
The even

1088
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Blank is I

1089
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,903
Your boss is not in charge of anything either of you

1090
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,231
So you may have a bunch of slaves

1091
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,047
Bowing down to you all along but

1092
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:43,423
You don't run anything in this universe you don't even run this planet

1093
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,751
You have just been given a little bit of power

1094
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,031
To test the faithful

1095
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,823
You know that

1096
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,919
Can you imagine being a film crew in there and trying not to laugh

1097
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,967
Are you doing this I mean

1098
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:01,343
I can I'm at years at here's my I'm just looking off into the middle distance wondering when it

1099
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,671
That's my face

1100
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,975
Why is this show is long as it is

1101
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,303
What is listening to this

1102
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,583
That's people who out

1103
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
Totally scared

1104
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
People who are running

1105
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Themselves

1106
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,239
In the next clip Alex

1107
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,287
I have no other way of describing this

1108
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
Then just like Alex

1109
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,847
Freaking out

1110
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,687
About trying to scare his audience into thinking people are coming for their kids

1111
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,503
Okay big fat man

1112
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,111
Assaulting Christians in downtown Austin to go out and have a demonstration with family because

1113
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,207
Rosemary man are going to go teach five-year-old how to have sex with him

1114
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,743
Official Austin

1115
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:45,631
Five-year-olds are different gender not having anal sex

1116
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,079
You know why because that's their food

1117
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
What the

1118
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,679
F*** as great music choice that really swell there at the end

1119
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
Like I'm really

1120
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,751
You scared of the idea of someone taking

1121
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,103
Event at the other on the other hand I was just like this show is so f******

1122
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,431
It's stupid there's no way there's no way what kind of

1123
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
You would have to be

1124
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,551
Way too far gone if you were to hear him say that it's the official curriculum

1125
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:41,951
Teach five-year-olds about anal sex would be like that that's true

1126
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:48,095
And some sort of a metaphorical way

1127
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Kind of sex

1128
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,031
Yeah this is spiritually true they are coming on our kid

1129
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,823
But I'm exhausted

1130
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,895
Jesus just listening to him be that performance

1131
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
Totally fake

1132
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,503
Angry open

1133
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,927
There's a there's a film crew here sir

1134
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
Probably why

1135
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:20,607
It's absolutely why it up for the camera so anyway

1136
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,655
Also found a clip of Rashida tlaib

1137
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,959
And yet you take some issues

1138
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Share with her

1139
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,287
What a shock

1140
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,103
Talib

1141
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:38,271
How many of you have trouble breathing oleifera wo your old guy I'm trying to help you breathe

1142
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,623
Super clean air compared to China and places

1143
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,839
Where are the jet streams it'll happen to dump over

1144
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,887
The Midwest and Texas

1145
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
That's the truth

1146
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,127
BMF

1147
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,175
Preying on children

1148
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Uh-oh

1149
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,039
Palestinian Johari alright cool coco

1150
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,599
Rashida tlaib helped organize a

1151
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
Campaign called we have the right to

1152
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:20,511
To breathe in response to a billionaire in her District flaunting

1153
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,815
Environmental Protection laws and refusing

1154
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Cease operating

1155
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Semi trucks

1156
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
In residential areas

1157
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,935
Which is massively polluted those neighborhood

1158
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,775
According to her official page on the House of Representatives website quote

1159
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,055
When large piles of black

1160
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,591
Black. Started showing up on the

1161
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
The Detroit Riverfront

1162
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
Blowing into homes

1163
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,759
The parks in the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality told residents everything was fine

1164
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,063
Rasheeda collected samples and got the

1165
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
The testator

1166
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,903
She found that this was a carcinogenic

1167
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Petroleum Coke

1168
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,487
And she started this organizing

1169
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Campaign to address

1170
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Problem

1171
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,887
In the political climate were living in there's a real danger that environmental regulations

1172
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,679
Will be rolled back or just not enforced

1173
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
I want that ball starts rolling

1174
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
People get hurt

1175
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:07,103
We've had relatively clean air and water because years ago we put regulation

1176
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
Place a big business polluters

1177
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
The follow

1178
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,711
Alex is a hacking a liar

1179
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,271
So there's no real need to explain why he's doing what

1180
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,575
Drivesense that rank

1181
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,647
Vile everyday people who could be persuaded of the

1182
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
Environmental

1183
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
An argument

1184
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:26,047
They just don't realize the situation we'd be living in if those regulations

1185
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
Work there or wanted Force

1186
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:32,191
I suspect they just take for granted the relatively good environment that we enjoy

1187
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,263
So all of this came up recently with

1188
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,055
Rasheeda because there's a Chrysler

1189
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,079
Plant being built

1190
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,383
It's right and she's been vocal about the

1191
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
The company take

1192
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
Taking the responsibilities to the neighboring community

1193
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,623
Chrysler is getting massive tax benefits to build the plant and as such they have a very real responsibility to not f****** the lives of

1194
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,159
The people in the surrounding area

1195
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
And that's all she's talking about

1196
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,231
It's irrelevant concern

1197
00:54:55,487 --> 00:55:01,631
To the Detroit Free Press spoke to a couple that lives down the street from where the plant is being put up and they talked about how their house

1198
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
House was shaking

1199
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
From the construction

1200
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
And said they quote

1201
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,983
Keep dust out of the house

1202
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
It's awful

1203
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Also

1204
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,103
It'd be wrong to bring up this topic without addressing

1205
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Studies that show

1206
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,175
Clearly the air quality is not a consist

1207
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Something in this country

1208
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
And their demonstrable pattern

1209
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:23,391
According to research presented by researchers from the Ohio State University at the 2019

1210
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
Keep beating of The Americans

1211
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,463
Logical Society quote

1212
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:30,303
We're seeing that these pollution hotspots are the same year after year

1213
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,863
And every time they're in low-income communities

1214
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
Auburn communities of color

1215
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,215
This has implications for a wide array of Health

1216
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
Disparities from pre preterm birth

1217
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,847
An infant mortality to developmental delays in childhood

1218
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,639
Do heart and lung disease later in

1219
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,943
There is a cultural Gap here

1220
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,271
And low-income areas are hit incredibly hard by polluting companies

1221
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,575
And the research tends to show that this disk

1222
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Proportionately is

1223
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,135
True of low-income

1224
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
Predominantly black

1225
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
Quote

1226
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:02,815
We found it for everyone percent increase in low-income African-Americans living in an area

1227
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
The odds that an area would be

1228
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
Become a hotspot gruesa

1229
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Significantly

1230
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,519
This was also true but to a lesser extent for increases in low-income lifepod

1231
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
So yeah

1232
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,663
I'll keep rambling on about China's air if you want

1233
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
But that does nothing to address

1234
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
The situation the tons of America

1235
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
Where their health and rights

1236
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,343
Clean air and unpolluted environment are being neglected

1237
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
Did for the sake

1238
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,903
Of protecting corporate profit margin

1239
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,231
People like Reseda are trying at least

1240
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,023
To address these problems head-on

1241
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,815
In a way that serves the people's interest

1242
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
But I guess Alex

1243
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,631
That's just what Palestinian

1244
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
Jihadis

1245
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,447
The idea that

1246
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,543
Well see we're better than China

1247
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,895
Irrelevant

1248
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,943
Okay one child

1249
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
Less

1250
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
Died a f******

1251
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,039
Poison in their lungs

1252
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:59,647
Great we're better than China

1253
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:04,255
Like makes you feel good but I think you're comparing yourself to something

1254
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
Terrible then

1255
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,655
So I don't know if keep playing that f****** dumb game if you want

1256
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:14,751
It's it's just of it's just a f*****-up thing to do this if which cuz that's

1257
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
It's such

1258
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
It's such b*******

1259
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,615
Cuz that means that it's fine for us to slide

1260
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
Back

1261
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,783
Closer to China as long as we're still a little bit better than China

1262
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,623
All the people who don't look like me better than to the worst

1263
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,695
Worst case scenario is not good

1264
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:40,095
Don't compare yourself to a terrible example of something like air quality in if you want

1265
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,631
You consider yourself trying

1266
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,655
Right

1267
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
Ridiculous oil spill wasn't as bad as the Exxon Valdez so we're doing great

1268
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
You're basic we we are heroes actually yeah

1269
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
It's silly

1270
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,967
So anyway accuses her

1271
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,759
Rasheeda of terrorizing

1272
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:04,159
Children Rashid Talib

1273
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:08,255
I go into classrooms and

1274
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,583
You know the second and third grade classrooms to read

1275
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,703
You know Grace for president to end at the end I try to explain what my job is in

1276
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:23,871
Before I begin I just asked how many of you all have asthma have a hard time breathing and a third at the class will raise their

1277
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,431
And I tell them

1278
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
I'm my job is

1279
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
2

1280
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,551
Protect your air so that you can breathe

1281
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:36,671
And the kids are like eyes wide open I said sometimes it's really hard right

1282
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,559
What

1283
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
What

1284
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:44,863
This woman

1285
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,215
Looks like

1286
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,431
Great another powerful woman of color

1287
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,223
Target

1288
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Snake

1289
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,831
Snake know how

1290
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,391
In order to be a snake-like person

1291
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,463
Right wouldn't you then have to have knowledge of your

1292
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
Get stuffed

1293
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,095
What's your forked tongue

1294
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
Just a clear pattern

1295
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,215
Just a clear pattern

1296
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,239
And how Alex

1297
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Interacts with

1298
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
Other

1299
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
Now I'm just

1300
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Rereading

1301
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:30,175
Metaphor Metamorphoses in my head where the guy just wakes up and

1302
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
He just goes to work like

1303
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,479
Normal day in everybody's fine

1304
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,063
You're a butthole

1305
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
Metamorphosis

1306
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
But with that

1307
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,671
Metamorphose

1308
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,695
That's the sequel

1309
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
I was trying to find that punk

1310
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,535
So anyway it's keeps getting worse

1311
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
And Alex

1312
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,911
A second and third grader sometimes I wish they can be in this room

1313
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:57,055
And make these decisions because they're you know they know what's right and they know they don't have any kind of

1314
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:03,455
Political strategy behind of these no it's just the right thing to do and I wont.

1315
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,735
That you support

1316
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:09,599
Mother's Day

1317
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,695
You love

1318
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,999
My God is big

1319
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Myself

1320
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
Wow

1321
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,839
Is that legal action

1322
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,887
I don't know but I mean like it's just

1323
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,911
Gross

1324
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:29,823
Ask you support child suicide bomber because of just the fact that you're Palestinian

1325
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,919
Don't forget to also wants you to be able to breathe

1326
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,991
Sure so that is what is more like

1327
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
Isis

1328
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,783
Then

1329
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:44,927
Like legitimately Allina are all Alex's responding to is the possibility of Greater regulation

1330
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,999
For businesses and this is the response

1331
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
Pretty f*****-up

1332
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,607
And realize is really bigoted position

1333
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655
We're scenes very consistently

1334
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Play throughout this a

1335
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,215
Really really f***** up

1336
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,751
It really is amazing

1337
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
How

1338
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
Complete

1339
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:04,127
The the propaganda wall really is whenever you

1340
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
Convince people

1341
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,687
Go to vote against their own ability

1342
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,295
Yeah you know like there are people there like no we can't regulate the

1343
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:16,159
Those those company bring Jazzy can't regulate them or regulations like

1344
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:22,559
Okay then choked to death I don't know what to do I don't know what to do for you bunch of kids have asthma and we know

1345
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,583
Ways that we can

1346
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,143
Help this issue

1347
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,167
Unfortunately

1348
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Going to cut into

1349
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Corporate profit

1350
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,287
Can't do that at least we're better than China

1351
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
So there we go

1352
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,919
So we've seen attacks on Michelle

1353
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,455
That were very white.

1354
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
Exxon

1355
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,039
Rasheeda which of also

1356
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
Center around

1357
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Him

1358
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
Taking issue with her at

1359
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,951
You do a lot of white guys don't like it when black women have power

1360
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,023
No would you know that was a trigger for a lot of white dude

1361
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,327
It was like a crazy number

1362
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,119
And so now we get into

1363
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
To what do you do

1364
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
He's promised he's

1365
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
He's going to go over

1366
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
And that is some Soros

1367
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,751
But as he's trying to

1368
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,287
BC

1369
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,847
The pesky head of Tech problems

1370
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,127
Oh hey

1371
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:13,503
George Soros

1372
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:21,695
I want to be clear we are going to hear this sort of tech glitch this is not your phone f****** up

1373
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,303
This is from Alex's raw audio

1374
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,375
Big paws

1375
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
Finding where Jews written

1376
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:43,455
Stealing

1377
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,879
Getty warehouse for 60 minutes

1378
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,463
Our Father stole it from Susie was supposed to say

1379
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:01,119
So the situation with Madeleine Albright is a little different than what Alex is presenting

1380
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:07,519
He has a lie about George Soros that he always tells about it working with a notch

1381
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
Making a true story about Madeleine Albright

1382
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,895
Fudge the details to make it matches false version of the Soro store

1383
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,783
Madeleine Albright was accused by a man named Philip Armour of being in possession of things that were stolen from

1384
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
His family's apartment

1385
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
After WWII

1386
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:25,183
This was apparently done by Madeleine Albright's father Josef Korbel

1387
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,487
Who was the Diplomat at the time

1388
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,023
I need check for a minute

1389
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,327
They enter the other ended up

1390
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,911
In that country after finding refuge in London during World War II

1391
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,751
I say Refuge because many of Albright's family members were killed in the Holocaust

1392
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,079
Though she's a Christian she had many Jewish relatives

1393
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,615
Who's investor family was it rich

1394
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,639
During the war if they do

1395
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Didn't get out

1396
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,199
So they went to London then

1397
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,479
After the ending

1398
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Hostility

1399
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
Prague

1400
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,367
Philip Armour was not a Jewish man who had his things stolen in the Holocaust

1401
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:58,719
His family was German in the post-war years over three billion German

1402
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,743
I've been expelled from

1403
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Backcountry

1404
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
That that they were in

1405
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
The ventricle

1406
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Waqiah

1407
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,423
To be clear I don't know if Philip Armour himself is Jewish

1408
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,447
And I'm not

1409
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:14,847
The saying he's not or is I have no idea not because of the Holocaust

1410
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
But because of anti-german

1411
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,663
Did the post-war years

1412
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
After that point

1413
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,759
It said that Albright's father stole a bunch of there

1414
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
If this is the case

1415
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,855
That's shity and they should have their stuff returned

1416
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
I don't know the ins-and-outs of this case

1417
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,719
But it's nothing like what Alex is presenting

1418
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,559
Even Harbor said that the confiscation of his family's items

1419
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Quote

1420
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,887
It was understandable considering what the Nazis

1421
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
He's did to his family

1422
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,959
But it was not necessarily right

1423
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Yeah

1424
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,799
Nothing to do with

1425
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
What Alex is

1426
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
Presenting

1427
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,663
He's only using this story in order to reinforce

1428
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,711
He's completely about George Soros

1429
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:55,807
And like rounding up Jews during the Holocaust under the guise

1430
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
Coming

1431
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Stop or whatever

1432
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,671
That's just such a funny

1433
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
Clip for the wave

1434
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
To get into

1435
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
Like to do

1436
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:11,167
And so the Jews were all that

1437
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:17,567
It's almost like you just wanted to keep going. Bulshit

1438
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,919
Weird non-sequitur it like it might as well just been like

1439
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,247
Rectum damn near killed

1440
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:29,343
Dentist next flip Alex denies George soros's

1441
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,879
Is identity as a holocaust

1442
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,951
George Soros is really mad at me

1443
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,743
But I covered this and I talked about it

1444
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,535
Any puts out the pr

1445
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,839
And the

1446
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,631
Disinformation

1447
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,191
That

1448
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
He's a holocaust Survivor

1449
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,079
Well I guess that's kind of like

1450
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:57,247
Hitler is a holocaust Survivor

1451
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,367
I guess he was someone that was around during the Holocaust and he survived

1452
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,695
Please true that what did you say

1453
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,231
Sickening play on words

1454
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:10,047
Manipulation illegal

1455
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,631
So we know that Alex believes that Hitler didn't kill himself

1456
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,703
Okay

1457
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,799
Where in Boys from Brazil Terra

1458
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
Position for him to have

1459
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:27,711
And I don't really want to get into it as much as I would say let's stipulate that Hitler did

1460
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,295
Now Alex is saying that

1461
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,599
Similarly George soros's

1462
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:39,999
This. It's similar to Hitler's experience in war

1463
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
Is Holocaust revision

1464
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:48,191
You're engaging in minimizing Hitler's Behavior

1465
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:51,775
Turning whatever Soros did into the level of

1466
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
The person

1467
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,591
The fuhrer

1468
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,431
If either of those things is trivializing

1469
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,967
The Holocaust

1470
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,247
And I find it to be a

1471
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
Yeah I think

1472
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:04,831
He's really

1473
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,159
Arundel Aranda that you shot the Moon

1474
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
If this was a game of Hearts

1475
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:15,839
He got all the trip added for the cycle got the white identity

1476
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:27,615
Rashida tlaib is a Palestinian Jihadi was trying to terrorize children

1477
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
And now we've got Soros Holocaust revisionism

1478
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
You see you guys don't talk about that I think you can

1479
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,391
Maybe understand why this is an episode that

1480
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
Should be cover

1481
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:45,535
Jesus but also I really just want to gloat about Alex's horrible

1482
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,815
Sound quality

1483
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
Issues

1484
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,167
And far be it for me we've had some sound issues to lately

1485
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
Yeah I don't I don't mean

1486
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
I don't mean to begrudge

1487
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:01,407
Hey we recording my bedroom and he is a millionaire

1488
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,687
Play changing qualities

1489
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
If

1490
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
My s*** sounded like this

1491
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,551
I would never put it out

1492
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:38,271
AccuWeather hiding place

1493
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,319
Small 47

1494
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,903
Remember all that run out at night

1495
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
They called the Bloodhound

1496
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:52,095
I will completely making that up 100%

1497
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,119
Nothing that's there is

1498
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,655
Said he has no proof

1499
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
Did Soros answer you

1500
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,471
Went and found juice

1501
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,287
Hiding places and then brought the Nazis back

1502
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
This is one of the worst

1503
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,103
Kind of Slanders

1504
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,407
You can accuse someone else

1505
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,687
This is

1506
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,711
Disgusting

1507
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,551
I don't even mean this just because like a iluv Soros or something

1508
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
Play Let's Not by angle on this at all

1509
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,623
This is

1510
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
Cognate

1511
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,743
And it just absolutely trivialize

1512
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
The Holocaust

1513
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
When you use something like this

1514
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
As a political cudgel

1515
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
Against one of your enemies

1516
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
What you're doing is

1517
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,727
Making it okay to commit a holocaust

1518
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,287
Alex

1519
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,567
His family eat he should

1520
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Have to worry about this

1521
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
Cuz his family

1522
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
F*** Hitler

1523
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,943
Alright

1524
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,647
And now that man has the ATL until they're probably lost it or say I'm a Nazi

1525
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:52,767
That is obscene I almost don't exist

1526
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,071
And time and space

1527
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Because

1528
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
Hitler

1529
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,079
And then a monster that served him and rounded up shoes

1530
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,639
Fun swatches

1531
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,175
Me and my family to live

1532
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,247
And I'm just if there's Justice in this universe Mike

1533
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
Can't we

1534
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,855
Do something about George Soros and his son out

1535
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,903
Standard openly funds

1536
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,439
Antifa

1537
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:26,303
Republic those documents are fake and what you're doing there is calling for someone to her

1538
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:32,959
You can't interpret it any other way on Alex's show like you hear something like that

1539
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,495
And like

1540
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,055
Should something happen to either of them

1541
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
I ain't like

1542
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:43,199
The person who did it there's a listener of Alex's show that is a clear-cut example of

1543
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,783
Like he is just been like

1544
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:52,159
Oh there's any justice in the universe ain't God's will can someone take care of them

1545
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
Meanwhile

1546
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,255
On a show like within the last month Alex's said hey

1547
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,559
Vengeance is God's but sometimes

1548
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:04,959
You got to be God's instrument you got it. Cause you to do things somehow that makes sense in both Direction within the

1549
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
The Canon of Alex

1550
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,031
Does work you have all the pieces Nessa

1551
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,847
Siri to think God is calling you to kill George Soros

1552
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
Alex

1553
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,407
Not saying we got to do something like

1554
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
We need to

1555
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,967
Institute of wealth tax

1556
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,271
He's not he's not trying to solve

1557
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,831
That problem he's not trying to solve any of the

1558
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,599
Even if

1559
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:25,951
Soros did do the things he's not saying let's send him to the f******

1560
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:30,559
Hate to stand trial he's not doing any of that

1561
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:35,423
That's f***** up this is unacceptable

1562
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,471
Alex has a guest

1563
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,263
Sure a lawyer

1564
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:45,407
No that's nice for once it's not one of his lawyer

1565
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
Turning Point USA

1566
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,039
And so that Alex wants have a conversation about it

1567
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
And I hear is that little bit of an in

1568
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,951
Is being censured and targeted

1569
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
Bye

1570
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:07,167
Turning Point USA

1571
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,959
All this why are there best people

1572
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,495
Being shuttered

1573
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,079
So Alex has a guest coming up who's on the outs

1574
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:20,479
Turning Point USA for the interviewee mentions that turning point is good organization as a whole

1575
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,271
Candace Owens

1576
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
No

1577
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,111
It seems worth mentioning that Alex just got done with a

1578
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:31,743
20 minutes segment of Holocaust revisionism and lying about Soros rounding up Jews during the Holocaust

1579
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
Tootsie

1580
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
When you been transitioning to an interview by saying it was wrong for turning point to part ways with Candice probably relevant to know

1581
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,447
Why they did that

1582
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,751
It's like we're at what you said recently

1583
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:46,079
You are not more important than the

1584
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,407
Every functionary in these operations as usual

1585
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
I'm told they're not

1586
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,991
Even when you make quite a name for yourself if you go Main

1587
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:57,087
Streaming some sent you can reach a point where you're just too f****** dumb or too toxic

1588
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Property

1589
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,135
Continue being associated

1590
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,695
That happened for Candace Owens in December

1591
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
2018 when she

1592
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
He said at

1593
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,023
Turning Point event

1594
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,607
I actually don't have any problems with the word nationalism

1595
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,703
I think the definition gets poisoned by elitist that actually want globalism

1596
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
Globalism is what I don't want

1597
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:19,871
Whenever we say nationalism the first thing people think about at least in America is Hitler

1598
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,663
You know he was a national socialist

1599
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,711
But if Hitler just wanted to make

1600
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,783
Germany great and that things run well okay fine

1601
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,111
The problem is he wanted he had dreams outside of Germany

1602
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
You wanted to globalize

1603
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,719
He wanted everyone to be German everybody to speak German

1604
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,023
Everybody to look at different way that

1605
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,815
Not to me that's not National

1606
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,399
Leaving aside how this, definitely seems

1607
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:46,495
Implied that it internally operating genocide would be totally cool with her

1608
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:49,567
Sing something like this publicly you just f****** embarrassing

1609
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:54,687
It demonstrates a very shallow understanding of what happened in World War and what Hitler was up to

1610
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,735
When someone says something like this

1611
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,295
You consider what other completely idiotic and

1612
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,367
Profoundly offensive things they might accidentally say in the future

1613
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,927
And if you're smart you decide to cut ties with her

1614
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,719
Yeah it's important to note

1615
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,815
This has nothing to do with the substance of what you believe Turning Point USA

1616
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:17,215
Probably probably exactly

1617
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Add Griffin

1618
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:24,383
You don't say it out loud question of what else might we have to do damage control about a future

1619
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Get her out of here

1620
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,687
Yes

1621
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,527
The most generous reading of her comment is that she knows nothing about the subject

1622
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,855
She's talking about the Holocaust

1623
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,695
Both of these are bad for the brand

1624
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
This is a holocaust

1625
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,255
Supporter

1626
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:46,143
Within certain borders I got both these are bad for the brand and turning point USA is all about that grip

1627
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:52,287
I think this is important to recognize however because Alex is saying that they were wrong to cut ties with

1628
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,359
In one of the motivating factors was clearly this comment

1629
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,407
Easily be interpreted

1630
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
Minimizing of the Holocaust

1631
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:04,319
That's really f***** up to here after Alex's just Rewritten elements of the Holocaust

1632
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
His purposes

1633
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,159
It's also really f***** up to here considering that

1634
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:12,255
Owen Shroyer had the host of Red Ice Radio is guest on his show

1635
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:17,119
This week he did what ya man so they're going full throated

1636
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:21,983
And it'll be even more f***** up or just dropping the hoods on when we get to who the guest

1637
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,519
He's introducing

1638
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:27,871
Well Nick Fuentes really appreciate him

1639
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,783
Coming on Nicholas J Fuentes

1640
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,367
Oh really you're really familiar with his work

1641
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:44,767
That's going to be a problem here in a minute who's this guy so we briefly mentioned Nick Fuentes in a recent episode in relation to him

1642
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:50,399
Working with that Network that also employed Joey salads the racist hoax video guy who peed in his own mouth

1643
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:56,031
I kind of hoped that would be the only time this dude came up on our show but apparently I don't get what I want

1644
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,103
Nick Fuentes is a pile of s***

1645
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,455
But he's also clearly a troll so talking about him gets into murky territory where you

1646
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,503
Can really never know how much of what he saying is

1647
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
Jason Sierra

1648
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:10,111
How much is Just intentionally provocative strangle people angry protest

1649
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:14,975
Doesn't matter f*** that guy he has a show called America First that is just

1650
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:18,559
It's really terrible green screen backgrounds Lobby bulshit

1651
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:22,655
It's terrible but I've listened to enough of this work to know that they're definitely something

1652
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,423
But he's very sick

1653
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,215
About and they're all bad things

1654
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
For one he believes that the United States

1655
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,055
To the country specifically for wife

1656
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,967
You'll generally resists the title of white supremacist or any of that stuff he pretends that he's just wanting to uphold

1657
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,783
Hold the intent of the founders of the country one of the country

1658
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
Be a place

1659
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,575
Typically for what

1660
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Now

1661
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,951
I'm going to go out on a limb

1662
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
When does

1663
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
Right

1664
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
It's an issue

1665
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:53,375
I don't care though

1666
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:59,775
Don't care I'm just saying it's there everybody to know it's there and then we can move on that is

1667
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:03,103
Interesting consideration whenever you have these sort of

1668
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,127
Escalating

1669
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Exclusive

1670
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Miss

1671
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,711
Position

1672
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,527
Do you not think that you eventually won't pass

1673
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
The test you are at

1674
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
Skating in that Direct

1675
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
It is

1676
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,903
It is one of those things where it's like

1677
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,719
The further on the edge of the in-group you are

1678
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,303
Seems like the more aware you should be that the in-group is going to

1679
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,631
Slop off those they're going to shed their skin Whenever there

1680
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:29,215
It does not go the other direction

1681
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,287
So the other thing that's very consistent

1682
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,847
Nick Fuentes work is it strain

1683
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
Hatred towards

1684
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,919
The Jews and Holocaust revisionism

1685
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,759
In this clip will hear Nick on his show America first

1686
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,295
Complaining about Matt Walsh

1687
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,087
The crying white nationalism

1688
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,623
After the shooting in El Paso

1689
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
From a little white Waze

1690
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:52,255
And please be advised listeners he's going to use some language

1691
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,047
It is very uncommon on Archie

1692
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
A kid

1693
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
2007

1694
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
Is very refreshing

1695
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Some people say

1696
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
And I'll take a selfie

1697
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
Deposition March

1698
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,615
Digestive iwaste

1699
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,151
Notice how the clause

1700
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Sorry for the late

1701
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,063
People like as a family

1702
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Matt Walsh

1703
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Guy

1704
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:18,879
Baguette

1705
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,671
And

1706
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:21,951
He's always lie

1707
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,999
And when a white person

1708
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,535
Suddenly is a big top

1709
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
Scumbag Steve

1710
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
People

1711
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
Yeah you're real

1712
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,127
Sorry for the language

1713
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Pictures of all the Lang

1714
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,687
Yeah that's what it is

1715
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,039
For their own pee

1716
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,647
Matt Walsh a busboy

1717
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,695
What it is

1718
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,487
I know some people don't like

1719
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
Use that expression

1720
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
Nobody else

1721
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
Nobody else talks

1722
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,239
White races

1723
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
Hayden public

1724
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,847
Brutal about it

1725
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,127
Keep typing on

1726
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Twitter.com

1727
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,687
Faget

1728
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
RaceTrac

1729
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
You work for

1730
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,855
So that's the kind of things that he

1731
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
Espouses

1732
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:27,487
Familiar with his work

1733
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:33,119
So if you take that for what it is you have a guy was offended at someone not supporting white nationalist

1734
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,679
In his responses to call him a race traitor

1735
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,983
And then talk about how he works for Jews

1736
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,519
Interesting

1737
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,335
As for Holocaust revisionism

1738
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,895
Nick engages in a crypto form of denial is

1739
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,687
That's pretty popular in neo-Nazi

1740
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527
Which would they do is they talk about the killings in the Holocaust

1741
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
Using the language of bacon

1742
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,087
Cookies

1743
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
I know it

1744
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,903
Sounds weird but you'll see what I mean in the

1745
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
Mac says

1746
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,463
As if I take

1747
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,743
One hour to cook

1748
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
A batch of

1749
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Cookie Monster ice

1750
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
15 ovens

1751
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,351
Working 24 hours

1752
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,375
Birthday everyday for

1753
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,399
For five years

1754
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:09,215
How long does it take Cookie Monster to make sick

1755
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
6 million batches

1756
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
I don't know that's a good question

1757
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,616
Certainly

1758
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,224
Are those really sound correct to me wait

1759
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,528
Takes 1 hour to cook a batch

1760
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,832
And you have $15

1761
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,112
Probably

1762
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
Four different kid

1763
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,440
Doing 24 hours a day everyday

1764
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Day for five years

1765
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Here's how long would it

1766
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Chameleon

1767
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:36,864
I don't know it certainly wouldn't be five years right the math dozen

1768
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
So 6 million cookies

1769
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,240
I don't buy it

1770
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:48,896
I don't even care to engage with a sort of shape but I wanted to play that for you so you could understand that this is a guy who uses his platform to

1771
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Super taken explicit Olive

1772
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,712
Holocaust revision

1773
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
In denial

1774
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,040
Nick is very young it doesn't know very much

1775
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,368
But he has a good handle on really far right talking point

1776
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,184
Is able to Rattle them off pretty quickly you know enough to

1777
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
To trick idiots

1778
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
He knows what he's talking about

1779
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,304
Consider him to be like an anti-jewish been

1780
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Sapiro

1781
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
A person a coincidence

1782
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,400
Which probably has nothing to do with you

1783
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
Shapiro's very public

1784
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,216
I don't know why you would

1785
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,544
What makes us absolutely unacceptable is that Alex's

1786
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,312
Cuz he knows Nick

1787
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
Nobody likes his

1788
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,480
If you had no idea who Nick was and had him on then that's a huge f****** and assign that he needs a better vetting process

1789
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,528
But knowing who he is

1790
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,576
And giving him a friendly platform is that

1791
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,112
Support for his ideas

1792
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
And what are you staying

1793
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,440
Mainly Holocaust denial and white Nash

1794
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,024
So congratulations Alex you're almost at your true form

1795
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Yep

1796
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,912
I heard that he was on I was like well this is progressing

1797
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:49,312
Dim the Red Ice being on Owen show

1798
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,104
Exactly the transformation that

1799
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,384
You know you yeah.

1800
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,688
It's basically what I was sorta predicting once

1801
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,736
At the deplatforming came

1802
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:01,600
And maybe took a little bit longer than you know you would expect like

1803
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,416
It may be he Jump Right In but he probably had more cash

1804
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,464
Before

1805
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,304
No it was almost it's almost Admiral how long he tried before he just

1806
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
Decided to become a white Nash

1807
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
Probably trying

1808
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,472
But all these people f******

1809
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
The ND

1810
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
This is how you do

1811
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,824
Discuss

1812
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
Assertive

1813
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,872
Neo-Nazi

1814
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,456
Holocaust Revision in a winking

1815
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
Isn't it funny

1816
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Cookies

1817
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,552
MattyB talk about cookies

1818
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,344
Hey you know it's easy

1819
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,648
The Holocaust was

1820
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Bad

1821
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
No matter the number

1822
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,768
You don't have to work that

1823
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
Yeah

1824
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,728
What you do if you want to have it if you want to come with it's okay with it then you really got to work hard don't you

1825
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,568
So Alex is going to talk to Nick Fuentes

1826
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,848
Which is how great

1827
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,896
Answer what the big

1828
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,712
Reason that Alex is having them on or so he

1829
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,600
Yeah is that Nick got into a little bit of beef with Turning Point USA

1830
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
Charlie Kirk

1831
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,696
Sure I don't care about their payday,

1832
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,720
But

1833
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,744
It's interesting

1834
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,768
Because they're having this

1835
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,536
Fight

1836
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,584
Alex's

1837
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
Looking at things

1838
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,216
Interested

1839
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,288
Turning Point USA national events they say it's

1840
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,456
We'll compromise in the left

1841
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,296
So turning point USA is not a little left

1842
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,368
Federally funded by right-wing billionaire cash

1843
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:43,232
Infusions are absolutely 100% the two of the right trying to look cool in college game

1844
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,304
So why is that likes hearing that they're a little left

1845
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:53,216
I don't know possibly because he's now exclusively hanging out with crypto-fascist to me or not

1846
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
A little bit left

1847
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,776
They still say the Holocaust

1848
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
Is real

1849
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
Yeah

1850
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:04,224
That is really what they're saying really is what they say

1851
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,856
Country

1852
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,184
If you have someone telling you to Turning Point USA is a little left

1853
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
Baby but you're talkin

1854
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,488
Someone who is

1855
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,280
Emily on the far right

1856
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:23,424
They appear to be a little leftist to them because their standard of where something falls on the political spectrum is

1857
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
Wheatley f***** up

1858
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,312
Considering Alex's Network as head Red Ice and Nick Fuentes on in the same week tells me

1859
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,592
All I need to know

1860
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,128
He's dropped any pretense

1861
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,944
And this network is on its way towards becoming something

1862
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,224
Very extreme

1863
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,784
We're turning point USA is possibly on the left

1864
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:45,696
The terrifying development but I'd be lying if I said I was surprised look at it look at these left this over here saying that Jews

1865
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,976
You should be allowed to live

1866
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,280
Come on budget lives

1867
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,048
Lives

1868
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
So

1869
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:58,240
Alex believes this is going to be a thing where they talk about turning point USA being a little laugh a little

1870
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,288
Whatever any please

1871
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,592
Clip that I have to assume that Nicks

1872
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,408
It said this question

1873
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,688
This guy asking

1874
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,224
Question at one of

1875
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,760
Turning Point 3

1876
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,832
Interspersed with

1877
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,856
Charlie Kirk

1878
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,136
Something directly contradict

1879
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,672
And then

1880
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,952
At the end

1881
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
There is a clip

1882
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,256
Charlie Kirk

1883
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,304
Saying that Israel is special

1884
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,376
Okay there we go

1885
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,936
On the left indeed Alex

1886
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,520
I think is a little bit surprised by the part at the end

1887
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:34,080
Being about that just overtly

1888
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,896
Not connected at all yet part prior to it

1889
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:40,224
And just being about him saying that Israel is a Holy Land

1890
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
This is not good

1891
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:48,160
Falls apart very quickly as Alex should have known it would if you knew anything about Nick Fuentes

1892
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,208
We're just out of that club in there to talk about it

1893
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,280
There you go

1894
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:58,144
2016 sprinklers talking about Charlie

1895
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,424
Why

1896
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,008
The fact they have contact with Trump

1897
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,152
Yeah I know there's a lot of other videos online

1898
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,480
Only telling Whoppers of lies or he has

1899
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:15,552
Amnesia brain damage

1900
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:20,416
Maybe maybe he's got a head injury or anything

1901
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:27,584
You know I definitely think that's possible certainly he could be mentally retarded as you like to say or he could just be straight up lie

1902
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,728
People get involved in conservative politics and maybe say one thing

1903
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,360
Or send them they get people funding the organization I get some connections they rub shoulders with power

1904
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,688
Purple people like the president or his son in the case of Charlie Kirk

1905
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,016
And then all the sudden they're pennies start to change and then suddenly

1906
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,832
It all their love for America becomes a love for

1907
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,392
Another country so yeah I mean he could have been

1908
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:57,792
Brain damage may be dropped out of

1909
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:04,704
I'd like to point out that at the beginning of this episode Alex talked about getting hit in the head with the light pipe in an axe handle another talking about Charlie

1910
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,984
Having brain damage

1911
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
Real fun

1912
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,104
That is exactly what you'd expect if you bring

1913
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,664
Nick Fuentes on your show he's going to

1914
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
Suggest

1915
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:18,784
That he doesn't love America he loves his real

1916
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,600
So Alex I don't know if he recognizes

1917
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,880
By this point

1918
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,184
This is where the interview is going to be

1919
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,000
Be driven and he doesn't want any part of that

1920
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:34,400
I know that this is what happened it's a good thing that that whole like dual citizenship right to return

1921
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:37,216
Kind of stuff is staying well within this far-right Fringe

1922
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,496
Call chicken

1923
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:42,080
I'm glad that you never see people on national TV saying that

1924
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:46,432
Somebody could be disloyal to the United States because they are

1925
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,760
Yeah but I don't even I don't even know if Charlie Kirk is Jewish

1926
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:54,880
I think this is even just like a

1927
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
Surefire

1928
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,928
I'd look throw it all in there

1929
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,952
So in order to me

1930
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:01,280
Make it not like interview that's going to be ended immediately

1931
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,608
Nick gets into some of his other positions that Alex

1932
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,376
B

1933
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,168
Be more interested in

1934
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,496
I'm 3xpress is his position on immigration

1935
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
Here we go I bet it's

1936
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,056
Very liberal

1937
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,616
Do USA Style

1938
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,248
Am I shall we oppose not just Mast illegal immigration but Mass legal immigration as well

1939
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,552
Now we know that the demographic change

1940
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:29,952
Stay in place

1941
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
And so on

1942
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,280
It makes into the uiy genocide mean

1943
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,328
That's so cool

1944
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:39,424
Illegal immigration of non-white folk

1945
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,704
2 dni

1946
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,752
It does sound like that's what his

1947
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
Stated position

1948
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:52,224
So it seems like I think like that one's he's wearing it on his sleeve than Alex

1949
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
This

1950
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,136
Sort of rhetoric about their look at the world the world needs more of that in the in the you-know-what

1951
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,720
Let's not worry about the coke on our Shores Dan

1952
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,512
Let's hurry about f******

1953
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,536
Keeping immigrants

1954
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,328
Great

1955
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,376
Here we go here's some more

1956
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,192
Chip that Alex will just have to allow on his show now

1957
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:15,008
Patriot on legal immigration

1958
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,312
I think he's anti-christian because

1959
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,128
Degeneracy

1960
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:26,784
Lady Maga some kind of make America great again theme drag queen supporting homosexuals in his organization

1961
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:32,160
He's not a patriot in terms of his own country I think a lot of people suspect

1962
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:35,488
Rightly so that he has a dual Allegiance or a Jew loyalty

1963
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,512
Israel

1964
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,816
Okay alright

1965
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:44,704
Wow so yeah I mean associated with homosexuals and anyway is anti-christian behavior

1966
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,032
Generous generous DeGeneres

1967
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,872
Where is this f****** kid from

1968
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:56,224
Chicago 1930s what is f****** happening

1969
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:02,624
He's from that's a very racist part of Chicago

1970
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:10,560
God damn it I believe that I have heard videos where he has expressed

1971
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,376
Well I mean if you're if you're already

1972
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,656
Comfort with a

1973
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:20,032
Interracial relationship that you're probably against

1974
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:20,800
Kind of a

1975
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,336
Denigrate

1976
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,712
This guy is so far past like what's what should be allowed in

1977
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:28,736
Normal Khan

1978
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,296
That I even find it

1979
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,088
Tough that we're talking about

1980
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,648
Like I don't even like the idea.

1981
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,672
He's come into our

1982
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:39,488
Spear by way of being on Alex

1983
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,024
Yeah

1984
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,304
Just like I did

1985
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,072
You think we would see the

1986
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,352
The day where

1987
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,888
Alex is falling apart

1988
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,704
I really want this and red eyes

1989
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,752
In Auto Show

1990
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:51,776
I mean

1991
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,336
It's just becoming more and more overt

1992
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,640
Yeah this is a white nationalist radio show

1993
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:02,016
Yep they go

1994
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,856
Uncritical interviews with people who are

1995
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,648
So beyond the pale

1996
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:13,280
I'm not just going to pretend to debate David Duke anymore I'm going to tell him to

1997
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,584
Full throated screaming from The Mountaintop

1998
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,376
I don't think you could do that because David Dukes

1999
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:22,752
Yeah I think I mean metaphorically

2000
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:29,152
It wasn't all about turning point USA campus

2001
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,432
Associated with Candace Owens

2002
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,456
Because of her

2003
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
Gas

2004
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,576
It's all about Optics as opposed to the actual car

2005
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,624
So Alex

2006
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,160
Seem to be surprised there

2007
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,208
About Nick saying this

2008
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:48,608
About that his loyalties to Israel

2009
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,656
What have I done

2010
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,680
If you listen to this

2011
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,984
Text Cliff I do think that Alex has a little bit back on it

2012
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,288
It's a country that we get support

2013
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:02,688
I just about every way shape and form monetary support Military Support belligerent

2014
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,504
I want to get you on

2015
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,600
Be glad to know it's not videos about it

2016
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,184
Where are the try to keep you from coming to those while saying they're open

2017
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,720
They're doing this and they

2018
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,256
Basically didn't stand up

2019
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,792
Candace Owens

2020
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,120
Personally I'm a libertarian

2021
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,656
Until I like

2022
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,704
The fact that Trump you know that his convention

2023
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:30,336
Indian we don't hate you

2024
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,272
Alex

2025
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,832
The needs to redirect man

2026
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:44,672
He does not want to have this conversation

2027
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:51,584
Ocean ocean

2028
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,984
As soon as possible in fact right now

2029
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,288
When you got this

2030
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,336
Hard right dude

2031
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:05,152
On the show

2032
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,712
Be constantly bringing up Israel stuff

2033
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,272
Alex is smart enough to realize like

2034
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
I

2035
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,320
I've stepped in

2036
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,624
I'm waiting for him to like

2037
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,648
Artificially

2038
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:23,072
Can't hear you good time for a glitch

2039
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,376
He needs to refocus the argument or that the

2040
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:28,448
Discussion into place where it's more about the

2041
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,496
Trivial culture

2042
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,032
Pop culture issues

2043
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,824
I got

2044
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,616
Somebody complained about something

2045
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,688
And that's all he can do

2046
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,992
It is it is kind of interesting that

2047
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,088
It does seem we're really close to him having to be like

2048
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,952
Right you know like you really all of his

2049
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:53,536
For all of his free-speech b******* we're really close to him being like

2050
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,608
I know

2051
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,936
I know he didn't even push back on it no be with his

2052
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:04,288
Don't do it later in the episode was we got a use those freedoms or else they'll go away

2053
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
God

2054
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,152
So Alex like I said the trivial issue

2055
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,968
Kind of thing is he needs to refocus this back on the tourney

2056
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:16,064
Greenpoint USA Petty drama is really what he wants

2057
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,088
To talk about because

2058
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,112
That's worth some money

2059
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,392
That's where some attention is

2060
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,696
Answer

2061
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,744
Makes a little bit of an argument

2062
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,768
I think is really in

2063
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,816
Interesting I think it's really

2064
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,632
Not Universal but it's very common

2065
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,400
I'm in these world

2066
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:33,984
This whole thing could have been averted I wouldn't be on Infowars right now

2067
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,032
Yorkie no controversy

2068
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,336
If he simply allowed me to take the picture

2069
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,616
Are going to the event

2070
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:45,248
I think a lot of people are now scratching their heads almost exposed himself he's made a bigger deal out of it than it is

2071
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:51,392
What is he so afraid of why does he not want to stand these questions

2072
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,232
So the sort the idea is essentially they Charlie Kirk Bain

2073
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,536
Nick Fuentes from

2074
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,840
I would assume that there's probably a good reason

2075
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,888
I bet there have been some interaction

2076
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:02,912
Between the two of them in the

2077
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
Past

2078
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,984
I know that I I was able to find some

2079
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,520
Medication that

2080
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,848
I got years ago Nick Fuentes was invited

2081
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,152
At a turning point of

2082
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:16,992
So there is some interaction between him and the organ

2083
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:19,040
I wouldn't be surprised if

2084
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,064
Naked Ben

2085
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,088
Like critiquing

2086
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
I'm saying like

2087
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,928
You dumb Jew lover

2088
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,488
Think that's entirely possible

2089
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,512
You clearly an antagonist

2090
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:33,888
Troll right why wouldn't he be behaving that way in the lead-up to Charlie say

2091
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:38,752
Don't allow that guy in I see that is incredibly likely

2092
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,800
But what are you saying here

2093
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
Is a classic manipulation

2094
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:48,224
To any right-thinking Observer this is more or less supposed to be stopped at Nick Fuentes

2095
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,248
Running

2096
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,528
Expensive Charlie Kirk

2097
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,064
And ultimately there's no good

2098
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:52,832
Solution for Keurig

2099
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,184
What's being done is that Nick is putting Charlie Kirk in a situation where he has to offer

2100
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,280
The first is to take a picture with an associate with someone who is a coup

2101
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,048
Clear bigger than

2102
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,840
Control who is outside of what you

2103
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,120
To be acceptable disc

2104
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,448
By that Association you'll be giving this voice your test

2105
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:11,008
It support which is something you absolutely don't want to do

2106
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,568
The second option is to choose not to us

2107
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
With this entity

2108
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,128
And based on

2109
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,920
A very reasonable assumption

2110
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Reply format

2111
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,016
What you doing

2112
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
Keep them out of your

2113
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:27,904
But this doesn't work either because now you've given this bad faith into the appearances

2114
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,440
Can't handle their ideas

2115
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,976
You're shutting down free speech

2116
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,816
By protecting your space from a holocaust revising White

2117
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,888
You end up giving the person precisely the fuel they need to

2118
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,680
To get the publicity they were after in the first

2119
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,752
This is a win-win situation for Nick Fuentes

2120
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,032
And that's exactly why

2121
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,312
You doing this and

2122
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,336
It is

2123
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,104
Evade

2124
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:47,872
Like

2125
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,688
You can feel Charlie BMI

2126
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,224
Like I want to say

2127
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,296
I don't want you here because you're a holocaust-denying

2128
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,576
Nazi lunatic

2129
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,136
But if he said that he loses

2130
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:02,976
Half of Turning Point USA Spotlight wikiHow

2131
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,072
Clear about like

2132
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,376
No of course I don't want this

2133
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,656
F*****'-a

2134
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,448
Masshole anti-semite troll

2135
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,520
Hanging around I think he has been cleared

2136
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,312
Well good for him

2137
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:21,664
What me there are limits I mean well he's on Alex's show

2138
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,736
Charlie Kirk

2139
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
Oh no yeah

2140
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,064
There's still a veneer there

2141
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,368
Whatever the case

2142
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,904
Now after this whole thing

2143
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,720
Other people in Turning Point have

2144
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,256
You know come out in desk

2145
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
Supported Charlie Kirk

2146
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
In this

2147
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,328
This kerfuffle

2148
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
And Nick had some,

2149
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:47,520
And you know what else is so troubling is after this whole event we see people like Turning Point USA

2150
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,664
People are now standing up and calling

2151
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,272
Everybody asked questions last night at his old is Ohio State University event

2152
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:02,112
Last about Israel asked about his support of homosexuality so on

2153
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:07,232
People working for Turning Point USA saying that if you opposed the Charlie Kirk

2154
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,512
Conservative agenda

2155
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,560
You're homophobic you're racist

2156
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:16,960
I think Benny Johnson said we were the Westboro Baptist kids because we're Christians because we support the Bible

2157
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,664
And none of the sexualisation of children

2158
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,760
What does that look like

2159
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,600
What is that pendulum going back to the other direction look like

2160
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:37,952
Why do you think that gay people being allowed to exist in Civilization and it

2161
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,768
It was just in the public is sexualizing

2162
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:47,168
Children of the pendulum needs to go back away from them being allowed to exist in public they need to hide again so I don't ever feel it

2163
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,448
Any discomfort at all for

2164
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,984
My way of life not being

2165
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,032
The only way of life that

2166
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,824
More less what we're getting here

2167
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,616
It does it does feel like

2168
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,408
Like this

2169
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,688
Fuentes kid

2170
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,712
Is so much

2171
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,576
Like I have to see these older guys like Alex Jones and all these people looking at Nick went

2172
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,648
Buckeye made you

2173
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,928
Yes

2174
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:12,512
You are you are what I created and I can you do

2175
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
And you don't know

2176
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
No they do

2177
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,840
Diving Nick

2178
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,424
Made by Mommy doesn't know that he's

2179
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,984
He doesn't know that the all of that Holocaust

2180
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,520
Denial and all of that

2181
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:26,848
Anti-Semitism and stuff is supposed to be about the Griff

2182
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,616
First

2183
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,736
Yeah yeah

2184
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:36,832
Hates you know like Alex doesn't with that like

2185
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:42,464
Iodized a x x I think we get caught up too much in how much

2186
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,232
So much of this

2187
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:49,888
The performance underneath that there is still some pretty freaking out about us

2188
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,168
Muslims

2189
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,704
A pool supply store Princeton

2190
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,752
That kind of thing is

2191
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,032
Still real for now

2192
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,592
What I think is more

2193
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,152
The point is like you see this me like I am

2194
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:03,456
Partially responsible for your

2195
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
Attract

2196
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,504
That you've gone down

2197
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,784
I cannot control

2198
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,600
Anymore yeah yeah you're better than

2199
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,208
You guys much more smart

2200
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,560
Then Alex next generation is

2201
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,584
Explore More compact

2202
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,376
Then the past generation

2203
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
Someone like

2204
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,472
Nick could be really dangerous

2205
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,520
With the level of

2206
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:33,664
Exposure that Alex has more of these two used to have certainly I don't think Alex would ever have him on

2207
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,200
Back when he was doing well

2208
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,224
No I mean if

2209
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:36,992
If he

2210
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,016
Yeah

2211
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:41,088
Like Nick Fuentes wouldn't have been there on the night Trump wins

2212
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:47,744
Not at the height of Alex's power itself never going to happen also to even be too much of an issue

2213
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,792
To even have his an employee

2214
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,328
But now

2215
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,376
I don't know I still think Alex

2216
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,144
Vivid Seats

2217
01:40:54,400 --> 01:41:00,288
He threw a pretty quickly and realize this

2218
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,848
The job offer treatment

2219
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Yeah I don't know

2220
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:04,896
It's f***** up

2221
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,944
Play one last leap year and it's

2222
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
Nick Express

2223
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
You watch them fall

2224
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:13,856
In the day which goes to your point and

2225
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,416
No I've been in this for

2226
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:20,256
2 3 or 4 years now I remember watching when I was in high school

2227
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:24,352
Donald Trump appear on your show and it was probably one of the coolest things I ever saw

2228
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,680
Everybody believed in 2016 the things were going to be different

2229
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:31,520
Donald Trump being insurgents in the Republican Party the hottest

2230
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,544
It'll take over

2231
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,080
Anna becoming president

2232
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:38,432
Everybody believed that it was going to be a real America first movement that

2233
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:44,832
The John McCain Mitt Romney George Bush conservative movement big tent conservative movement was done

2234
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:47,648
To see all these people that wear the Maga hat

2235
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,768
They co-opted Donald Trump message to Donald Trump look the Optics and everything

2236
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,328
Use the same tactics of

2237
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,680
Do you know they're really embracing this model party globulus mentality

2238
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,984
So he thought that Donald Trump was going

2239
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
To bring an end to the big

2240
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,312
10th.

2241
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,360
And what do you mean by that is

2242
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,384
Non-whites

2243
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,176
Are you mean by that is not

2244
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,224
Y'all pretty means by that

2245
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,296
Is anybody who doesn't think that the United States

2246
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,832
Does a white Christian country

2247
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,856
Weather is

2248
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,392
Should be a power Monopoly

2249
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,672
In the hands

2250
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,720
Of those people because of

2251
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
There's

2252
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,280
And there

2253
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,560
Choice of religion

2254
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:30,912
It is fun to watch you hear someone talk about trying to get rid of the Big Ten

2255
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,448
Ethiopia

2256
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,216
Who has a

2257
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:37,824
Expressed about like let's say a guy who isn't into white nationalism

2258
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,128
Calling a race traitor who works for Jews

2259
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:43,968
Yes you can't hear Holocaust denial and revision coming out of somebody

2260
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:50,368
And not think getting rid of the big tent at the GOP probably mean something different to you give idea

2261
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,392
Is what they're talking

2262
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:53,952
Certainly it's the ideas that there

2263
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:58,304
It's all about the free market of ideas it's just infuriating

2264
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,072
Agates

2265
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,888
It's a dating I don't really care I mean

2266
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,192
I'm at Karen one-level but like

2267
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,752
This to me is so expected

2268
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,288
It's not like

2269
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,104
I see this episode this 30

2270
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,920
It's so

2271
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
If you have the

2272
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,504
You have the the s*** with

2273
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
Michelle Obama at the

2274
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Beginning

2275
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,624
You have the the receipt at slabs

2276
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,904
Stuff but just

2277
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
Repug

2278
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:28,768
You have this long Soros diatribe

2279
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,792
Where you going

2280
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,560
Further

2281
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
Then he hasn't

2282
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,168
Oh yeah so Rose in these behavior in the Holocaust

2283
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,704
In World War II

2284
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,496
Revising elements of

2285
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,288
Of the Holocaust

2286
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,104
Then he talks about Candace Owens shouldn't have been

2287
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,152
Cut Loose from turning point USA

2288
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,688
And the reason that she was

2289
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,456
Because it was

2290
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
Because of

2291
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,904
Deny around your show

2292
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:01,792
Who you introduced as someone who you like they're working you're well right

2293
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:02,560
Like this

2294
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
Use

2295
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
Bad

2296
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,912
It's what you expect

2297
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,960
Because of what Alex has

2298
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,752
Been promoting

2299
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,032
Throughout his career

2300
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,848
But just not over yeah yeah

2301
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,152
Coming off

2302
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:17,920
A bit

2303
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,992
And it's

2304
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:25,344
This episode is a certain thing that it's just like well buckle up

2305
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
Cuz

2306
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,904
A month two months

2307
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,952
Now who the f*** knows that the

2308
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,720
The show is going to be

2309
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,512
Like imagine

2310
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:38,400
Yeah so red ice is coming on Owen show because they got kicked off social media

2311
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,680
Because of the

2312
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,472
Made a choice

2313
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,240
Yeah

2314
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,032
So if they're being

2315
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,056
Put on

2316
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,080
People who are being

2317
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,128
Deplatform been censured

2318
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,408
Like us

2319
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:53,248
Alex has an alternative for that he has his own band

2320
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,784
M.video site

2321
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,344
Where people who have been kicked off social

2322
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:00,160
That's where it's supposed to be where those the

2323
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,184
Things go

2324
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,000
Now is Red Ice going to get a channel on there

2325
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,280
Racine the great merger

2326
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,840
Infowars ice

2327
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,376
Kind of see

2328
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,656
The possibility

2329
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
That this

2330
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:14,240
Network that Alex's built

2331
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,264
Infowars

2332
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,056
And its tendrils

2333
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,104
Like this new Band. Video

2334
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,408
It could very easily be co-opted

2335
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,456
By people who are

2336
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,248
Far worse

2337
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,016
Burnham

2338
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,296
Fireworks

2339
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:28,832
And also this

2340
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,624
Yeah yeah

2341
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,648
And that's so that

2342
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:36,000
The troubling possibility but it's also I believe what I predicted might happen with the

2343
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:36,768
Is

2344
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:44,448
Video Endeavors that if he does allow other people on guess who's going to be

2345
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:46,496
Take a look at all the replacements

2346
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:49,312
Conservative Replacements to Twitter turns in

2347
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080

Yeah I get it yeah

2350
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,944
If what you're if the problem you're trying to

2351
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,712
Dissolve

2352
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
Is a problematic

2353
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:57,760
Exclusively

2354
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,528
Almost

2355
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
Exclusively applies

2356
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
2

2357
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,088
Racist

2358
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,112
Nazis

2359
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Fascist

2360
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:07,488
Solution it's going to be populated almost

2361
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,096
Reply to roses

2362
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,376
Crazy

2363
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:16,448
It's because you're solving a problem that they only they

2364
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:18,752
I really

2365
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,800
You know it's telling

2366
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:23,616
The disillusionment every generation

2367
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:27,456
As their disillusionment with their with the president that they helped us

2368
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:30,016
Like for us with Obama

2369
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,320
Why didn't he close Guantanamo

2370
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:34,880
Why didn't he stop torturing people hours

2371
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,672
Torturing all of that stuff

2372
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,208
That I was very deluge

2373
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
Dissolute

2374
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,304
And for this guy his disillusionment with Trump is

2375
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,352
Why can't I torture people

2376
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:47,936
Why can't I drone people why can't I buy murder people

2377
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:52,544
Maybe not the life is difficult samples but like why isn't it this white country

2378
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
Exactly

2379
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,592
Why haven't we

2380
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,360
You f******

2381
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,920
Crackdown on the gays and non-whites

2382
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:04,576
What is going on that was the promise you that I heard in truck

2383
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
You made it to me

2384
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:12,000
Don't you end up in trouble be like I didn't make it to you there's good people on both sides now you know what you f****** say

2385
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,280
It's because

2386
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,304
This side

2387
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,584
Strong

2388
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,960
Yeah they have a supernatural healer

2389
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:25,056
So I do not appreciate the

2390
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,616
So I think it sucks

2391
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:31,200
I think that Alex is veering into territory that was very good

2392
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:31,968
Quickly

2393
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,528
I'm so far past the point

2394
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,320
Social acceptability

2395
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,368
That I just got

2396
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,392
I don't think I

2397
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:44,512
I mean any much further than this and I'm kind of the opinion that maybe we should

2398
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:47,584
Yeah we shouldn't cover that show it all if it's

2399
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:51,424
I don't know our responsibilities something maybe we should

2400
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,960
The sky

2401
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,008
It when you see this sort of thing

2402
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,032
Like wow this

2403
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:59,872
This is bad sign for the future but also good that you're also doing this

2404
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,432
The shift in the middle of a going-out-of-business

2405
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,480
Everything Must Go

2406
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,016
Good luck Alex

2407
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:10,368
Buck I wish you the worst of luck and I hope you fail them
