1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

2
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,512
Beverages

4
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:09,376
Doesn't talk a little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Do you have any allergies

6
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Peanut allergy

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008
Or the light

8
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
So at least not

9
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,664
Normal allergies I believe myself to be allergic to avocados

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
But I'm not positive that that is

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,040
Is the truth all right there's a story behind eye

12
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,856
You know it's one of those things that I've never gotten

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
Officially tested but I got

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,048
Sick eating guacamole or avocados multiple times

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
When I was younger

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Not get sick

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,752
Times that I ate two avocado

18
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,824
Trick to it but I have no confirmation on it and I haven't had any

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,688
Avocado

20
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
Like I could touch it

21
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
My girlfriend

22
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,648
I think there's severity levels with the allergy

23
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
I don't know

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
I've been

25
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Sandblasting

26
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,120
For saying I might be fair

27
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
I could be I could not be

28
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,592
That's what we're going to get a lot of messages like avocados in the only hypoallergenic fruit there is worse.

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
I don't think there's anything else other than that I've had

30
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Everyone's allergic

31
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Victaulic poison

32
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,952
Maybe I don't know

33
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
But I do know a lot about Alex Jones

34
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
Theme of the show

35
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
Right

36
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
That's murder

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,992
I don't know if you get off the cuff struggling to EpiPen

38
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,112
We got an interesting absolute to go over will be covering

39
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,440
The present day of August 28th

40
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday of this week

41
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,072
Uneventful days nothing much going on these days

42
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888
There's some interesting stuff going on with Alex

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,192
But I'll be honest a i8

44
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
We care about a whole lot of

45
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Just

46
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Spiller

47
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Nothing happening

48
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
In many sectors of the infowar

49
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,784
Or at least Alex's version of it and a lot of the stuff that you look into it

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Expecting to find

51
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Is that

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
You find nothing

53
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Which is strange

54
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
Abu get into all that your involvement

55
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Before we do

56
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Give a shout out to

57
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024

I'm a policy wonk

68
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976

00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Watch So Adam

72
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Nah

73
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Or nausea

74
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
I can't remember I was corrected on this

75
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
I do not

76
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,503
I am a real

77
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
Thank you so much though

78
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,183
And this one might actually be stealthily trying to get up

79
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Commercial in here

80
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,791
This might be a real thing I do today

81
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
Play some goddamn Farrelly brothers movie I've never seen

82
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,359
But the Palermo roads executive Search you are now

83
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
All wonderful take

84
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Democrat

85
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
Heroin

86
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,303
Is freakishly large

87
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
So one of the reasons that I needed to get back to the present day

88
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,647
We're at the front of the the

89
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
The Syracuse

90
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
The first

91
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Was

92
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
Lawrence O'Donnell

93
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
AIDS

94
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
They was kind of unwise

95
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
No very explicitly

96
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
Maybe too-good-to-be-true and irresponsible to get on TV

97
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,791
Report to put his own f****** name

98
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,911
You know that but I felt like this was the perfect opportunity for Alex

99
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
Seeing as

100
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Heated the f*** off mat

101
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Spoiler alert

102
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Not one mention of it

103
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
It seems like just a layup

104
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:58,815
It was a gimme for Alec

105
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
Saxony didn't he does not to take that so

106
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Me to check in on the present

107
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Null set

108
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
All that

109
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,591
Now the other one was yesterday

110
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
It's on Wednesday

111
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
The the Trump

112
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
He tweeted that

113
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Fox News

114
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
Are we need to look for a new news Outlet

115
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Very fun

116
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,415
Which I expected to be Alex's Greenlight

117
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
To be like

118
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
I have been here all along

119
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:38,239
Firefighter

120
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
All the races

121
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,103
I kind of had a feeling of like we might end up

122
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
Alex really try

123
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,479
Not necessarily to Taylor's contact cuz it's already there

124
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
We might

125
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Stewardess

126
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
I'm trying to fill that void

127
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Pay close attention

128
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Do that

129
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
As I think we might be

130
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
We might be at a point

131
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Of of

132
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Demarcation

133
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Released

134
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
One of the things that I was

135
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Considering

136
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
As excited like

137
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
Let's stay in the present here

138
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Check in

139
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Necessarily

140
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
I don't see Alex

141
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Really

142
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
C m notice

143
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Ricky's chicken

144
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
For real

145
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Maybe Alex is actually

146
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
Finally in that state

147
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Just say I don't want to work

148
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,351
I know if it emotionally at times it does

149
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,471
But I don't think it's fair or accurate thing to say that Alex is

150
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Messerli checking

151
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Because I think he is still

152
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
The game

153
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Yes it's

154
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Starting on the 28th

155
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
And Alex the begin his show

156
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
By explaining the globalist

157
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Populate the planet

158
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
In order

159
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
To rid themselves of competition

160
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
It seems

161
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
It seems like a strange motivation but

162
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
That seems to be what he is

163
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Bowser

164
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,007
Broadcast off yesterday

165
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
Cover story

166
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Wow.

167
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Bruschetta population

168
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Wilmot house

169
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
The competition

170
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,567
Earth

171
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,135
Transhumanism

172
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
I looked it up

173
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Oh boy

174
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
This is it this is a hot start to the show

175
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
So what is coverage of a new book that was written by noted futurist James Lovelock called Nova

176
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,743
In the book Lovelock argues that in the future

177
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
Species of being in the universe

178
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:47,423
He's being poopy so far past us in terms of intelligence probably not even be interested what we're doing

179
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Mulatto people interact

180
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
It's all good and well to take your shoe with a few

181
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Futuristic

182
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
But it's entirely separate to pretend that the role of a futuristic Society is to unveil the actual

183
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
As if they have some otherworldly psychic

184
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Gift

185
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
That's how I look seems to think about future

186
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
Does it there modern-day soothsayer

187
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,743
Making predictions about Trends in technology and culture

188
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,583
But they're telling the world with ease and what will definitively be

189
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Yeah you already has a

190
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
And we've seen how well he

191
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,495
Right must be able to see the future

192
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
It's

193
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Crazy

194
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Way too thick

195
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Dumb

196
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
In our endgame coverage we went over a bunch of the failed predictions of Alex's other favorite futurist Ray Kurzweil

197
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
We don't need to repeat all that over again but

198
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Suffice it to say his batting averages

199
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Is not great

200
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Beatrice

201
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Batting average

202
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
Is not great

203
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
He's most famous for his 1974 Gaia hypothesis

204
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Which stated the Earth

205
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,263
The Earth itself is a living organism

206
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
Itself and has for millennia

207
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Environment suitable for life

208
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
In the years since the Gaia hypothesis

209
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
Science has come out to demonstrate how this

210
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Barely unsupported

211
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,623
Or is the New Scientist put it the ideas beautiful but flawed

212
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
There are elements

213
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
With understood science

214
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Is much as ecosystem

215
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Systems can recover from

216
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
Some forms of damage

217
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
Ecosystems are in

218
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Interdependence

219
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
With a larger point

220
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Seem like

221
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Gets grounded

222
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,127
This is the largest contribution Lovelock and is made to the culture

223
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
View as a fun thing to think about booking

224
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Completely off base

225
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Scientifically

226
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
There's no reason to not look at the predictions

227
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
How is a 100 year old man

228
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
As equally idealistic

229
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Chicken fun to contemplate

230
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Not that realistic

231
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
I have often said

232
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
The same thing about the

233
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Expelliarmus

234
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
It is very fun to think about

235
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Necessarily

236
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
I'm guessing this is a final chance

237
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
Harry Potter

238
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
Harry Potter ever

239
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Recognize Real

240
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,575
Zodiac

241
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
System of his

242
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Hypothesis was

243
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
That

244
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
When it was refined the later

245
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
He had some scientist

246
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Criticism towards a

247
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
Then he resigned his theory to make it more in line

248
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
With the Saints

249
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
Really laid down what he was saying

250
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
People that respond to it was like

251
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
Well what's new about this isn't accurate

252
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,783
Accurate about this futuristic

253
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,855
Aspect

254
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Relay

255
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Scientific

256
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Fanfic

257
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Sure

258
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
It's just the nature of the sort of future

259
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Twerk

260
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
These people are often

261
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Never actually right about much

262
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
But they presented compelling a romanticized version of things

263
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,663
As they often still latch onto a metaphorical truth about the time

264
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
Which is easy to confuse with being right

265
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
Alex is so desperate

266
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
2% of self is correct about his

267
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:20,159
Theories that his enemies are trying to kill off the population

268
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
To tell you how

269
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
It is

270
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Larry Flynt

271
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Now it's important

272
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
To point out that

273
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Other stuff used

274
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
There's more than one Albert

275
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Einstein in

276
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Attitude in the United

277
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
One of them is a non-profit the bills itself as being dedicated to

278
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
Supporting nonviolent resolutions of international

279
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Crazy

280
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
Criticized by many is actually supporting efforts

281
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
For US Bank

282
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
Regime-change

283
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
I'm not a criticism without looking

284
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Too deeply into it but whatever the case is

285
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
It exists as a foreign policy entity the folks

286
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
This is on International conflict

287
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
The other one is Albert Brooks is personal

288
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,727
The other is the other Albert Einstein

289
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
Institute is also known as the max

290
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
Planck Institute for gravitational physics

291
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,455
These are unrelated entity

292
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
Because the guy who started

293
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Inspired by Albert Einstein

294
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Signs

295
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Non-filer

296
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Yeah

297
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Whatever

298
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,583
I looked into that I can't find any real concrete connections

299
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Epstein or either of these

300
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
Nor can I find any concrete connection between Lovelock

301
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Either of the

302
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,567
If I had to guess I would say that the most likely possibility

303
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
Here is the Lovelock might have given a lecture at the

304
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Science one

305
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
And they might have donated to the political

306
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
But I can tell you with certainty

307
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,879
She is the Jeffrey Epstein was not the Omni budsman of either of them for the last 20 years

308
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
Partially because it's on butts

309
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
Partially because he wasn't the Ombudsman of either of us

310
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,935
Omni budsman

311
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
Criticize your ass

312
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Editorial

313
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
What kind

314
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:21,503
Idiot would hire f

315
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
It's a it's a little silly

316
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Straws

317
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,719
It's really really easy to believe that Alex wouldn't realize there are multiple

318
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Albert Einstein

319
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
And you just be so desperate to

320
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
The appearance

321
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Connections that don't exist in order to

322
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Sports.

323
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Do this

324
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
Until I see some actual evidence

325
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
Provide

326
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
Yeah at all

327
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
So you starting off

328
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,063
And when I heard that I was like

329
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
Is not good

330
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
There are no citations

331
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Today is Alex's

332
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,999
Just making an argument that to this guy this futurist

333
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
Telling everybody

334
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
That humanity is going to be

335
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
Be killed off

336
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Goes to which is

337
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Strange

338
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Specific

339
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
This is bad work

340
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
Alex

341
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
Kind of deals with why he's doing such a bad

342
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
That

343
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,095
Elsa show

344
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,967
Alright

345
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
You a****** 20 f******

346
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
All your life has been preparation

347
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
You should have prepared

348
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,511
15 years ago

349
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,143
Cleo I don't have the information available to make

350
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Sit down for an hour before the show

351
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
Actually talked about the depth of the rabbit hole

352
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
That's it that's your whole

353
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,015
Popped out

354
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Still

355
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
Trying to find

356
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Prince

357
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,679
More preparation

358
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,775
Alex is really big into

359
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,383
Kundalini Yoga who got to do that before the show

360
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
I will accept

361
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,783
So this is get to the bottom of the global conspiracy

362
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
I'll just ask

363
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,903
I think this is demonstrable of like one of the things that I see

364
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
In the present day that makes

365
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
It's not very

366
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
And that is

367
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Isn't that

368
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,815
This is a really sad display

369
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,655
Other person comes on air makes a bunch of

370
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
Tenuous connections that may or may not exist

371
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
And asserts them as proof

372
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,127
Like the globalist they're trying to kill off people to eliminate

373
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
Competition

374
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,319
As I promised yesterday I was going to prove shape

375
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
How sad is this

376
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
That's not good

377
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
It's it's a mess

378
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
It's exactly how you would

379
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
If you are trying to get

380
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Fired from you

381
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
A job

382
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Turns out you own the company

383
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,471
Like that

384
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Is anybody going

385
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
That's right I Ono

386
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
At least I'll give you a

387
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Abused Alex

388
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,551
I'll give it up to him like he's a smiley pirate he hasn't

389
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,439
And not only has two excuses for why he's unprepared no

390
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Tomorrow

391
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
Complaining

392
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Call me this morning

393
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
What's your problem

394
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,223
Security

395
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,063
Was he

396
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,183
Hookah stores around here

397
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
You're the f****** CEO and

398
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,751
President and head of the figurehead the face

399
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Chief talent to this company

400
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
You got a deal.

401
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
What the f***

402
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,391
You don't actually saw this happen on Monday Tuesday

403
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:19,232
Steve Doocy he was going to bout to do father and friends and then they went to a remote

404
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,328
Chasing a guy who stole his backpack citizens arrested at Horsethief

405
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,680
Save it for Alex is like

406
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,544
Do you know all of his talk of I do six hours of prep for every show I'm in the

407
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,384
I'm in the studio hours before getting my articles in line

408
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
And getting everything

409
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Straightened out doing research

410
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
If you get completely

411
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,880
Like how long was that call but this a not even happen

412
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,232
Okay but that's mental space that's at least a half-hour

413
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
And half-hour phone call completely derailed population

414
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:06,336
That you've been screaming about for over a decade go f*** yourself

415
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
I just like

416
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
I love the juxtaposition

417
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
He's like I'm about to

418
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,112
Reveal the entire conspiracy behind the globalist

419
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,000
Play we're going to go all the way

420
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
730 f****** chaos

421
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
There is one

422
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,056
Version of this I could see it being real

423
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Okay

424
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
That was an important backpack

425
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
If there was something in there that Alex

426
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
Didn't want to get out

427
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
I could see that ruining

428
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,976
Who gives a s*** I think it was actually the coronation

429
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:03,424
What was it like a backpack full of footage of like things that invalidate his narratives or

430
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:14,176
Search supplements cam openly

431
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
I understand

432
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
The way you're presenting

433
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,392
It wasn't employees backpack

434
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
Also

435
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
How did that happen

436
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:33,120
You have snipers on your roof

437
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:39,520
There's guns everywhere another employee

438
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Convenience stores

439
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:52,576
I don't understand that either

440
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Goodbye

441
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
Also is Alex

442
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
The head of

443
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,656
Third person is well he would be like that security had to go get it

444
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,960
Security camera

445
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
I don't know

446
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
I mean

447
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Bring out the guns

448
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
DeVore

449
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Also

450
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
How do they trace that

451
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
Backpack to a convenience store

452
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,808
Accidentally took the wrong

453
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
There's no way back

454
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,232
There's no way that he's like somebody took a backpack from the Infowars Studio

455
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:37,632
We're going to set up a two and a half kilometer perimeter Global is drop-off points are generally

456
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Piggly Wiggly

457
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,056
Send the gendarme is around 2

458
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Anywhere that sells a twin

459
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
We're going to get to the bottom of this thing

460
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Ridiculous

461
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
Prepared

462
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
Doesn't stop him

463
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
Which is talk

464
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Bible

465
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,816
Okay you don't have a lot of preparation

466
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
It's important

467
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
The fall back on

468
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Like the Deep Wells within you

469
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,216
Religion

470
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Alex Goes to the scripture

471
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
And I

472
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
I don't think he does a great job

473
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Because

474
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Well

475
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
You'll see

476
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,016
Because

477
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
You're going to override it

478
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
Fishers

479
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
You're going to conquer all

480
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,328
Forms of

481
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
You will conquer the universe

482
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Garden

483
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
Good and Evil

484
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:08,512
Action

485
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Alright

486
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,960
Knowledge of evil

487
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
The spirit of the devil

488
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
So adamant

489
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
It has like

490
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
He seems to think that

491
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:32,576
When Eve ate the apple original sin was created at Original Sin

492
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,368
Is globalism

493
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,976
I'll be in a little bit

494
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,536
Just basic coding information

495
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
The Villa whatever

496
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
Like

497
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
It is little big live but I don't think

498
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
It's far off

499
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,056
Now you're absolutely right

500
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,640
I want to point out the one

501
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
Gigantic

502
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Flaw in Alex's interpretation

503
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:05,344
He seems to be suggesting that the knowledge of good is the knowledge of how to setup good systems that encourage Humanity

504
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,184
Have a knowledge of evil is the knowledge of how to setup parasitic anti-human

505
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
Is that a thought.

506
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,840
God forbid Adam to

507
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
From the Tree of knowledge of evil

508
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
It was a knowledge of both good and evil that was for

509
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,056
Genesis 2 verse 16 clearly says

510
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:31,456
And the Lord God commanded the man you are free to eat from any tree in the garden but you must not eat from the Tree of the knowledge

511
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Image of Good and Evil

512
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
For when you eat from that tree you will certainly die

513
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,392
It's been ology of both good and evil that God tells Adam he's not allowed to

514
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
Is that so

515
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
In the Bible is to hold

516
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,096
Explicit knowledge of how to create human empowering system

517
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
This is an inescapable conclusion

518
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
The literal text

519
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,728
The Bible and Alex's Express believe

520
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Which is a problem for our

521
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:01,152
If Alex wants to say that the globalists are creating a bad answer human system which is the offshoot of possessing

522
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
The knowledge of evil

523
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
Send it

524
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
He's just as evil according to the Bible

525
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
Because he's very clear

526
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:14,976
Create a good human empowering system which relies on the knowledge of which was equally

527
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Right

528
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:26,496
Essential problem with Alex's

529
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,312
Interpretation of this scriptures

530
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
His conception

531
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
God it makes

532
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Because

533
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
The way he can

534
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,272
Steve God I don't think that guy has any idea how to create good social system

535
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
That makes no sense

536
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Interpretation

537
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,720
For you to have but I don't think you're preaching

538
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
Biscuits

539
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
Point

540
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
Never heard of

541
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Anybody

542
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Literally

543
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
Who interprets Jennifer

544
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Photo I've never heard

545
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
I feel like

546
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
I'm a little bit worried

547
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
About Alex's relationship

548
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,664
Kinship with scripture cuz it's so full of aces

549
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Jesus

550
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
Which is the practice of letting your own son

551
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
Subjective beliefs and ideas

552
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
Seep into the text

553
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,880
Itself as opposed to a exegesis where you take

554
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
The text

555
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,208
And you'd approach it from an objective

556
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
Seems to really want

557
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
The text

558
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,120
To support his worldview

559
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
So he inject them into it at

560
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Then interprets

561
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Which is

562
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Sloppy

563
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
And malicious

564
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
Much closer to militia

565
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Doctor visit

566
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:46,368
Globalism into the world

567
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
Essentially

568
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
The argument you know well what I think

569
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Do you say

570
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,816
Is that God would have been cool if you only ate from the capitalist

571
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
But then they eat with the

572
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,424
From the goddamn commie Apple to

573
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
And that's how we know the

574
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
Sure

575
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Again

576
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,128
Even if from the capitalist Apple

577
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,736
Still forbidden by God

578
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Fair enough

579
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,832
Still forbidden by God according to Allen

580
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
Eve is not fought through his position

581
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
Huge

582
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Pool

583
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
It is in his lodge

584
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Sty

585
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,704
Large portion of the show because he didn't prepare his I don't know

586
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,776
Collegiate level course on the bottom of the Rat Hole

587
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
Sure Taylor Swift I guess you got a video music award

588
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Speech

589
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
He pointed out that a music video there's a

590
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Petition for lgbtq

591
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Atq right

592
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Right

593
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
Is criticize China

594
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Fine

595
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,728
Because there's repressive laws about homosexuality

596
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
That's all good and well

597
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
I guess

598
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
But

599
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,384
Because Alex is dumb

600
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
He slips up and

601
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
Implies something in this next clip

602
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
It's Towing

603
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
I feel like if you listen to that

604
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Carefully

605
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Alex's

606
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
Kind of endorsing locking up

607
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Lgbtq

608
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Tiki people

609
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,344
Because he is

610
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
They believe

611
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
That's the Chinese

612
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
They know not believe know what really

613
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
Get you there because it means that we

614
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
They know

615
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:12,032
As we know the reality which is that as there are more of those people.

616
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,152
Yeah absolutely that

617
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
They lock these people up

618
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Alex

619
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Conclusion

620
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,344
I think well I think what he's

621
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,392
She's doing is criticizing them

622
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
As like

623
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,280
See look they're locking people up just for their non

624
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Informative

625
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,168
Whereas you're criticizing the Trump Administration

626
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
It all we want to do is make sure no more if you happen

627
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
It's it's

628
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
I think he's easy

629
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
Difference of degree that I can only describe as

630
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
The slightest

631
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,968
It's weird and I think the other thing

632
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
Is that he thinks he's criticizing

633
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Policy

634
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,416
The Chinese Behavior

635
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,768
Is offering an explanation for eczema

636
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,840
Horribly

637
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,168
Support of the action

638
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,264
China right with the action is not something to eat

639
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
To be interested

640
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Except

641
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
A prop

642
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
To use against John

643
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Right

644
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Right

645
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
Lego

646
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
You hate

647
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:31,136
Neo-Nazi

648
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Is there a divorce

649
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Civilization collapsed

650
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
Hitler he would have killed them all

651
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
So

652
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
Wait are you

653
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376

654
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
Directions

655
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Birkenstocks

656
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Your intent

657
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
To listen to some of his

658
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Commercials

659
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Because of this

660
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
V

661
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
Listening to it on the podcast form

662
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
The audio stream

663
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
That's released you get the Genesis Communications

664
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,464
So you get like still water filtration companies

665
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
The sponsors that the network has

666
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
Get the cut

667
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,608
But when you watch them on

668
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
On the infowars.com

669
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
Stream

670
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
All you get is Alex

Bulshit

672
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Oh really that's crazy

673
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,104
Some of these commercials were going to listen to you little bit later are

674
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Absurd

675
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,200
But also a lot of them are just

676
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,320
Little shorts videos

677
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,880
They're not even commercials as much as they are like

678
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:40,256
We just.

679
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Insane

680
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:46,144
Villa Rebel of non-interest for people who have money

681
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,704
Buying up time on Alex's program

682
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Unheard of

683
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,568
If you're actually advertised

684
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
No I don't

685
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
Okay if

686
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Kiku

687
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,480
If someone would pay to advertise

688
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
Count dankula Meandering

689
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,880
Commercial break

690
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
I can't imagine ideas.com

691
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Even if it would be cheaper

692
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
Time to buy

693
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,632
50 bucks

694
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,424
Herb dip latest meme

695
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
During commercial break

696
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,592
That means that no one will pay Alex $51 advertise products

697
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
It's devastating fixer

698
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
What's going on

699
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,552
Okay so it didn't surprise me at all that Alex

700
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,856
Descended into a very desperate sales

701
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
You're on this August

702
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
28th episode

703
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,488
He spends a really long time outlining the new special

704
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Which is if you

705
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,560
You buy some product

706
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,400
For 50% off you get a giant bottle of another product for free

707
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:56,032
It says

708
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Hey kit

709
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
There's even a point

710
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,944
In one of these episodes where he's talking about the special and he's like we're losing money on

711
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,992
If people keep telling me Alex

712
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:11,648
Stop it it does sound like if his numbers are at all accurate this is

713
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
This is bad

714
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Bad sail from the visit

715
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
This perspective

716
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,096
Towards the end

717
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
Trying to sell this new

718
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
New cell

719
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
He has another

720
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
But he wants to

721
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Makes me

722
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
It makes me think of it like

723
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
The it's a tough time

724
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,712
Station

What

732
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
Important

733
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
When are sales

734
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,432
Your local TV station

735
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,296
It is to support the Mothership

736
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Please

737
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
Reach Out

738
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,208
Local station

739
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
I've heard him say stuff like this by

740
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,816
Before but not with that kind of desperation

741
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
That I feel

742
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Like

743
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,680
Sales pitch

744
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,240
New special

745
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
Ratings are not good

746
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
At the local station

747
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
No one wants to buy ads on those station

748
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:13,760
Here's Alex signaling that he's in Jeopardy of losing zody's unless people were pulling for him

749
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
Separated by ads

750
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,088
Not as a sound financial decision

751
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,648
But as an ideological move to support him

752
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,304
It makes sense why you would think that's a reasonable thing for people to do

753
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,888
The station's program director that he would buy commercial time on the show

754
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,448
It makes sense that he would just assume this is how things

755
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
What does this

756
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
And that's just trying to get his audience

757
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:41,408
Do you like artificially keep him afloat because no one's interested in buying ads

758
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
If no one

759
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
Buying ads

760
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,272
That means there's a large audience

761
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
Listening on the station

762
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
So I think

763
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
I think there's a crunch happen

764
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
And it's a little too late from

765
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
Start the 60

766
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
The movie hatched

767
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
Probably

768
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,352
I would say so I don't think he's going to community

769
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,424
Manipulate

770
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
It's the

771
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
A good plan

772
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
I've heard this

773
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,200
Steward of thing from him a lot over the years I can't imagine anyone actually

774
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
As ever

775
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,088
Stepped up in the way he's looking for a telephone by billboards

776
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,416
I'm just sending a $20 check

777
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,464
To your local

778
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Is that what like

779
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,936
Care of Alex Jones

780
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,544
Buying those little I donated in your honor things for your birthday but it

781
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Instead it's

782
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,128
Wcg on over the

783
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Yeah it's

784
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
Ludacris

785
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,480
And also

786
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Sacrilege

787
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,648
But also wbcr in Tennessee would be my bet for the last station that will ever abandon

788
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
So it's them

789
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Feel

790
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,352
From profit or business standpoint

791
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Strong ideological allies

792
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,984
Play the BCM program

793
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,056
Their website is just a bunch of ads for young product

794
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,872
And poorly formatted articles about the evils of

795
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Fluoride

796
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,712
I was thinking about it as I was looking at their website

797
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,552
Feels like this is the future of what Alex is going

798
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
To have left

799
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
If Trends continue support will be live

800
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Living in those

801
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Those types of presents

802
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,912
If there's a part of me that feels like maybe that is all that ever really was

803
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
Behind the glitch

804
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,984
Overproduced

805
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,312
The artificial traffic

806
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Yeah like

807
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,920
Maybe that's all that ever was there behind a facade of

808
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Yeah

809
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,040
All the johnny-come-lately to get seduced and with

810
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
Fun conspiracies

811
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,112
Stick around for a little while and then

812
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,208
Get disenchanted need to go to the hardocore stuff or come to their senses

813
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
Like once that in and out slow

814
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Disappears

815
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
And your left

816
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,840
Just went through Zack

817
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
What you doing

818
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:14,240
I think you just got a lot of buggies that Geo cities ass pages

819
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
It comes to mind is

820
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,128
Bottom of a rat hole

821
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,920
There similarities

822
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,272
And it's weird

823
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Them to be eating

824
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,344
Call

825
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,928
And caller expresses

826
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
Did you share

827
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
A little bit okay

828
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:43,168
A little bit more worried about that I was

829
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Before

830
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
Based on Alex

831
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
What is rhetoric

832
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:52,128
So is what's going to happen when Trump is not around because we know Trump's going to win in a landslide he's waking up a lot of people

833
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,431
Things are happening because of him

834
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
But my biggest fear Alex is

835
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
What's going to happen when we don't have

836
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,855
You know our commander-in-chief you know and then

837
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
What's going to happen after

838
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
That's my biggest fear

839
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
No you haven't

840
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,007
Aussie idea that you've

841
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,031
Express sometime

842
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Is about

843
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,591
Fear of trump.

844
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,687
Stepping

845
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
Not just drop it likes

846
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Trump supporters not accepting

847
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
I don't I still think it's a little bit

848
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,767
I don't know not paranoid but a little bit like

849
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,423
No I think there is like a part of it

850
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
Could be getting ahead of ourselves

851
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,591
Really Grim predictions about

852
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
But

853
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,431
You want to listen to tune in to Alex's show

854
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:03,039
Sitting here like it just being bandied about between Alex

855
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,695
I'm so if the reality that

856
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
Comes about dozen

857
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:17,119
Match that we've already decided to stolen election

858
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,215
Narrative and rhetoric stand for

859
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,031
I agree with you it's inevitable that that will be the argument Alex

860
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:29,407
Now too or Trump agrees with that

861
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
I think

862
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,735
Will be out of our depth food

863
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
Speculate that Alex

864
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,159
Alex has Kaitlin Bennett

865
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,207
Kent State gun girl

866
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Who is turned

867
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
To an Alex Jones

868
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Employee

869
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
She's on because

870
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
I guess

871
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Are you looking today

872
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,703
Okay strong

873
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Don't care

874
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Situation

875
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
Apparently Dan Crenshaw

876
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
The

877
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Congressperson

878
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,991
He is in favor red flag laws

879
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Forgot

880
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Right and this is a big

881
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
Problem sir Alex

882
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Yeswelder

883
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,207
They respect a man who looks like a pirate

884
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Right

885
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:22,143
A couple days before Alex was screaming about how piker didn't

886
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Show

887
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,775
Crenshaw appropriate respect

888
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Wait wait now you hate

889
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
What's going on here

890
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
And apparently

891
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Kaitlin Bennett

892
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Said something

893
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
And then he

894
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:44,671
Sandra DM video where she read the DMs

895
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,975
I don't know

896
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
Didn't look at the care

897
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:54,143
I will I will only I will only listen to this if she read it in

898
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,727
Alright

899
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
I just

900
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
Have a couple of clips

901
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
Because I think they're demonstrative

902
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
But more important

903
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
The first is

904
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,687
Alex doing what he always does

905
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,015
Anyone else has a story that he wants to co-op

906
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
Message me

907
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,119
Appreciate

908
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
He's trying to piggyback

909
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:39,455
She has it on her own channel

910
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:45,855
That's correct

911
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
He's doing this

912
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
All the f***

913
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:52,511
So awesome to see every single time

914
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,839
Do I got to use his terms

915
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,423
The attention economy that they're they're they're getting

916
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
I just

917
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,847
Infowars is covering it

918
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,919
So in this

919
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
Talks about how she

920
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
She doesn't mind being

921
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Criticize

922
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,623
She did make a video of about Dan Crenshaw Santa Clara message

923
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
But she does not care

924
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,975
About people criticizing her listen to themselves

925
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,815
Certainly not for stretches longer than 30 seconds

926
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
I think it's self-contradictory

927
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,711
He's so deep into the

928
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,015
Insult somebody to like

929
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:54,207
I got silenced because trying to silence

930
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
That's cool

931
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
Clip she does David she called him a name

932
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,151
Father by me calling him names

933
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,735
Come on

934
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
Just stop it

935
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,879
Trying to silence me feel bad

936
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
For me

937
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
Trying to silence him

938
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
And make him feel bad

939
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
It's son

940
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:34,655
I'm not I'm not I'm not coming out in Crenshaw

941
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,447
Nothing but I am going to say

942
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,775
Her go f*** yourself

943
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Stupid

944
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,455
Red flag law a little bit I want to say that I don't believe

945
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,735
Disposition on on

946
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Red flag laws

947
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
Which for the most part is

948
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:57,951
We already have laws in place about like if you say you're going to kill someone they can lock you up

949
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,767
Yeah right I don't believe that position

950
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
I don't I don't believe it at all because

951
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,887
Certain things

952
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,727
Vicky uses as examples of like we already have laws in place

953
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
Personally don't work

954
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,335
Is there any circumstance

955
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Where in Alex wouldn't

956
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,431
Scream about how this person was being oppressed

957
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
Until after the fact

958
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
Of them committing

959
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
Okay there is no

960
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,879
You like even if someone beat their wife

961
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,023
Are there it's domestic violence

962
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
To protect themselves

963
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
You did bulshit

964
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
Soap

965
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,335
Shootings happen

966
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Trump came out

967
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,711
Better background checks and possibly the

968
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
Red flag laws

969
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,831
And Alex is like a don't worry about it

970
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Now

971
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
He has a really interesting

972
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
Perspective on this

973
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Now

974
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
I'll get into it after

975
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,375
What about it

976
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
He said

977
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
Because it wouldn't do anything

978
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
So like a

979
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,415
This is his position here

980
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
It's

981
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,815
Like Trump

982
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
Red's this bill

983
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,935
And then somehow was like God

984
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,495
We already got it covered

985
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
That's the position that you're putting forth

986
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Here

987
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Which seems like a

988
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Problem

989
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,919
Because up till this day

990
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
August

991
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
28

992
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Shooting

993
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,551
I was his narrative has been completely

994
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,087
About what Trump did

995
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
He tries to present the position

996
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
He liked what he was doing

997
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Donald Trump

998
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,839
So there's a shooting and he knew the Democrats wanted to take away

999
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
So what do you do

1000
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,191
Was he pretended that he was open

1001
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
2 gun

1002
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
Registration

1003
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,775
Gun regulation

1004
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
So with that

1005
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,639
Is that the Democrats out to the open

1006
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:28,223
They revealed that they wanted to take away everyone's guns and they've been caught

1007
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,039
Is Donald Trump has exposed them

1008
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:36,415
As being the gun grabbers that they are and they walk away with nothing that was his

1009
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:40,255
Consistent narrative

1010
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Anytime

1011
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,583
Trump says about being open

1012
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
2 gun

1013
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,935
Reformed

1014
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
Did Trump is just trying to Rope A Dope

1015
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,567
Position is that Trump was opened a gun reform

1016
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,639
Read the Bells

1017
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Exact

1018
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
Okay

1019
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,271
Way more sense and also

1020
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,391
Exist

1021
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Response

1022
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,975
The red flag laws

1023
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
Which makes it troubling

1024
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,071
Because I'll be leaving

1025
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,655
Himself

1026
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,495
Alex makes both arguments on this episode

1027
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:26,591
Listen to this

1028
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:31,199
About

1029
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,903
Emotional

1030
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,327
This is a completely contradictory s***

1031
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
He's trying to preserve

1032
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
Impossible to narratives as to Trump

1033
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
Response to this gun

1034
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
Legislation

1035
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,871
Like legitimately he is abusing the s*** out of his listener

1036
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:05,759
This is this is not okay believe both

1037
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,903
Trumped-up

1038
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
Trump is

1039
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:22,399
He's got he's got it all wrapped around his little finger alright

1040
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
In the other scenario

1041
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,751
He was just lying

1042
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
From the jump

1043
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,591
I think it was

1044
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
Situation

1045
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:35,199
And he's trying to manipulate the Democrats into overplaying their hand

1046
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:44,415
In the second scenario though he's just you just read the bill

1047
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Position

1048
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Zenith

1049
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:53,887
In reality

1050
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
If you just lie

1051
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
Sure

1052
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,751
That's not mutually exclusive

1053
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:04,127
Another call and this guy is a real real sucking weirdo

1054
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
But I mean

1055
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
What else can you

1056
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
Weirdo

1057
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,551
Let me go

1058
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,623
I have body armor for your

1059
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:21,023
Would like to have it

1060
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:44,319
What a plot twist

1061
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,855
Never happened before

1062
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
I would love to

1063
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,975
To give your employees body armor sound

1064
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,327
Call Ana recent

1065
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,143
Present-day episode

1066
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
Dispatched

1067
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,191
A team of three

1068
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Employees

1069
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,311
1/2 to 30

1070
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
Chance of snow

1071
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,407
As far as I know yet

1072
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
To cover the protest

1073
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,271
See something is that he's employees over there but could not remember the

1074
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,551
The third person's name

1075
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:21,951
And I'm thrilled to report that he still doesn't

1076
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:36,287
The other self

1077
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:40,639
So rude

1078
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:48,575
Where were the third person is you got to get a new job

1079
00:54:53,951 --> 00:55:00,095
Nobody knows your name and you can just take your resume right now and move on over you are

1080
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,399
Get out there's time

1081
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,191
You are

1082
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:09,055
Please make sure you never learned the others

1083
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
The damage has not been done

1084
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,663
Two years I worked at

1085
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,199
Others at Infowars

1086
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,527
So put that on your CV

1087
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,111
So we have one last call from the 28th and I was taking more calls

1088
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
Here is really a

1089
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
Spoiler alert

1090
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,303
You get to call her

1091
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
What's interesting about

1092
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,911
Is how Alex response

1093
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Reasonably

1094
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,127
Thanks for calling around here

1095
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:51,551
Alex this is Adam with no more news. Org I've been one of your biggest fans for 10 years

1096
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,135
And perfect topic today to talk about treason in China

1097
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,695
Because ever since the rise of trump I really

1098
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,511
Studied it deep and realize that all the

1099
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,839
Accusations and rumors about you being a Zionist

1100
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Apologist

1101
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:09,471
Propagandists are all right and Trump is a completely a Zionist agent

1102
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,543
Owned by Edelson a pack.

1103
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,407
Bailed out by the Rothschild in the early 90s for billions of dollars with Wilbur Ross

1104
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,455
Our Commerce Secretary

1105
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:24,063
He got the top Zionist award in 1983 from the jnf

1106
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,135
The Jewish National Fund founded by Theodor herzl

1107
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,439
Are you already getting why this is

1108
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Is weird

1109
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,743
He's not saying anything

1110
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,767
No

1111
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:38,911
He's letting this guy talk

1112
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
You might be chewing

1113
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
If he's not

1114
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
Is he okay

1115
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:48,127
Did he stroked out is he staring off into the middle distance

1116
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,175
This is what he does with collars like

1117
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
He wants them

1118
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
Able to speak their piece

1119
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
Yeah I don't know why

1120
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
It doesn't

1121
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:00,159
Feed the need to interrupt them yell at them like he does

1122
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,951
With other callers who have

1123
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,999
Contentious points

1124
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,535
Other collars

1125
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:11,935
To converse about what their topic is interrupt

1126
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,263
This is not a natural reaction that Alex has

1127
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
2 calls

1128
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,895
Totally controlled by Netanyahu and Kushner

1129
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,991
Trump donates to Kushner who is hibachi donates to Abad

1130
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,295
They consider Christianity idolatry

1131
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
That's who got to Trump support

1132
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
And you

1133
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,183
Blaming everything on China deflecting

1134
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,023
From who really is controlling and conquered this country

1135
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:43,423
Is treason George Washington with accuse you of being a traitor and you should be ashamed of yourself

1136
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,519
For covering up for who really consideration

1137
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
I barely think about Israel

1138
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:04,671
Israel

1139
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Israel

1140
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,239
Everybody around Americana

1141
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,031
This is just like a

1142
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,567
Crazy to me

1143
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,127
This is not how he responds to

1144
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,247
It's very specifically it to Joy seems like this

1145
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,575
I made the other situation

1146
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,647
This is totally scripted this whole thing is a f****** fake

1147
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,695
No I don't think so

1148
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,327
Is b******* not ending

1149
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,679
List of Clear Lake

1150
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:54,591
He's not responding to any of Alex at all either this is not how a flute

1151
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:59,967
Sick like the guy from no more news. Org

1152
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,527
Alex Jones both of them are

1153
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,575
Scripted

1154
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:10,975
Your your conspiracy about this is not something I'm going to support

1155
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:18,399
Evidence of that I'll come around to it I don't believe necessarily that needs

1156
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
To be true

1157
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:23,007
I could see a situation where someone who holds the believes that this guy does

1158
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,055
Could compose himself in order to

1159
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,847
Confront Alex in the way that he is

1160
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,895
On that call

1161
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
I don't

1162
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,735
Received this criticism enough

1163
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:38,367
That he could have a service boilerplate way he responds to it after the call is done

1164
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,415
None of that is necessarily

1165
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,463
Indicative to me of some sort

1166
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
Scripting

1167
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:47,583
What is weird to me is the way that Alex allows him to speak

1168
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,167
For over a minute uninterrupted and then at the end

1169
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Can I talk

1170
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,519
Can I make my point

1171
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,847
And is a choice Alex's make

1172
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
I don't know why he's made

1173
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,687
It seems very weird

1174
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,223
I don't think it means

1175
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
He's f******

1176
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,063
Supported by Israel or responded by Israel

1177
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,599
A shield for the Zionist

1178
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,415
Then he wants to deflect this criticism or whatever

1179
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,951
I don't know what it is

1180
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
My working

1181
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,743
Siri in the past

1182
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
Because I've heard this behavior from and before

1183
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
It's very out of line how we interact

1184
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
Active callers

1185
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,167
My working theory is that he wants

1186
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,935
Accusation

1187
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,959
Shenzhen criticism

1188
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
Of him

1189
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
To look like this

1190
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
He wants

1191
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
The perception of

1192
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,103
People who don't like him to be

1193
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,407
The world

1194
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,479
And I understand why that has some utility

1195
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
It's very weird

1196
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,831
Supports my theory that it's

1197
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
On the other hand the only believe this like this is not a conspiracy theory

1198
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
Specific

1199
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Thing is

1200
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,071
Is is b*******

1201
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,959
The only other ever the only thing that I would say

1202
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,263
Possible Theory here is

1203
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,311
How regularly

1204
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,359
Talk shows have fake collars

1205
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
About

1206
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:15,391
I want to listen to I mean listen to the tone of his voice that's a terrible because they supposedly a right

1207
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,951
Alex Jones

1208
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,999
I don't know

1209
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,815
Not the only other thing that I will give you though is this

1210
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,887
It is entirely possible

1211
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
The way Alex

1212
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Said

1213
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Can I talk now

1214
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:32,031
In such a resigned almost childlike tone

1215
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,615
Is that that is exactly how he was berated as a child

1216
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,199
And for the longest time that's how his dad would

1217
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,759
Would completely come down on how you be like

1218
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
Can I

1219
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,551
Can I talk now

1220
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
I don't know

1221
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,415
The 19th

1222
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,951
Okay

1223
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
August 29th

1224
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,535
And Alex

1225
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,351
Dim the show by laying out the

1226
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,375
Full breath

1227
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
Of his

1228
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
Conspiracy

1229
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
About immigration

1230
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:07,103
He just lets that

1231
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
Alex spells it out

1232
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,343
Border crisis

1233
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,359
Will use giant third world population

1234
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,711
For 6 months to a year

1235
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,759
Literal

1236
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,319
Organize them

1237
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
SMUD

1238
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
The borders

1239
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,719
Other Western Nations where

1240
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,791
You are set up to receive

1241
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,327
They are deployed

1242
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Welfare

1243
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,175
And then give them ideas

1244
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,015
Driver's license unionized and then weaponizer

1245
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,855
Okay

1246
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Alright

1247
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
So

1248
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,975
How do I join the subs

1249
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,767
Union

1250
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:35,423
Julia local 415

1251
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,983
Goodwill

1252
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,847
Steal all their buddies got to be touches all of his bases of things he hates

1253
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
Emigrate

1254
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,151
Democrats

1255
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
Union

1256
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,015
Just make sure it's all melange of all that stuff

1257
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,295
Smorgasbord

1258
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,855
I'm going to I'm going to be brutally honest

1259
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:58,463
It might be partially because I've been a little bit my sleeps

1260
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,743
Disrupted

1261
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,791
Construction on the building

1262
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,583
And maybe

1263
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,399
Baby I don't have as much patience as I usually do

1264
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,703
Where is maybe I will try it

1265
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,055
My response to a clip like that is

1266
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,383
Dude that's f****** crazy

1267
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,903
Explore the idea of refugee camps beating brainwashing centers

1268
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,463
Go f*** yourself stupid

1269
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,127
I know they're going to leave them on the border for a while and then they're going to be

1270
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
Deploy to the left

1271
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Union

1272
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,015
They're going to take him and give them welfare and jobs

1273
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,343
For the

1274
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,487
Complicated portrait

1275
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,559
Yeah he

1276
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,119
You might accuse me of punting

1277
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:13,215
But I'm a no-go fuc yourself

1278
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,543
So Alex unionizing sub slaves

1279
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,871
Alex says something

1280
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,151
Location for his ID

1281
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
Conspiracy

1282
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,759
And what do you know

1283
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,575
This is an absolute

1284
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:43,423
By 2050

1285
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,239
Resolution

1286
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:48,799
Milia

1287
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,895
Our population

1288
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,687
Who will be

1289
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
Uncontrolled

1290
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,063
This team's first of all

1291
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
Unrealistic

1292
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:01,855
Wow

1293
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
First of all

1294
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,183
Know our population

1295
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,999
But also like even if it were

1296
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,279
I mean

1297
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
Ridiculous

1298
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
Just Plumbing

1299
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
Numerical stay

1300
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:22,079
So what are you doing here is he's just lying about a 2000 report titled replacement migration is it a solution

1301
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,871
Declining an aging population

1302
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,199
If you notice you look closely

1303
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
Question

1304
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,319
Hypothetical scenarios and looking at ways migration

1305
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,367
Problem

1306
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Swordigo report

1307
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:44,095
These 600 billion figure comes from an extreme example and hypothetical scenarios raised in the report where low birth rates

1308
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:50,495
Would require large numbers of migrants coming to stabilize the workforce among other population-based societal consideration

1309
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,615
There were other scenarios with lower numbers but Alex Jose this one cuz it's the highest that it makes

1310
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Morse

1311
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
Sensational

1312
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,271
At no point is this report recommending at no point is it laying out of

1313
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,415
Plan it's just a report looking at population-based hypothetical scenarios that goes on to look at whether or not by graichen

1314
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,719
Could be part of a solution to a problem

1315
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,743
In those situations

1316
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
Alex is a complete liar

1317
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:20,447
Image of 600 billion non-white

1318
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,983
Pictures the story that way

1319
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,823
The goal is to create animosity towards immigrants

1320
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,711
Doesn't even see them as people with their own motivations anymore but his weapons of the globalist

1321
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,271
It's trying to take down the white Western Civilization

1322
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,855
And that way is narrative is not only deeply manipulative

1323
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,391
Based on lies and betrayal

1324
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
Presentation

1325
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,999
This is all this is about

1326
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,047
Sometimes I think the UN has

1327
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Contest

1328
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,095
To see who can write

1329
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,119
The most terrifying

1330
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
To White

1331
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Conservatives

1332
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,775
Like they've had so many great well-written like

1333
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,359
Question is just a question that

1334
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Mirrors the

1335
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
Deepest darkest

1336
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Sphere of

1337
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,015
Should migrants replace some of our population

1338
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,647
Very sensitive Oak

1339
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
Preoccupied with

1340
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
But

1341
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
There's other news

1342
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,447
That the queen

1343
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
Has allowed

1344
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
Shutting down of Parliament

1345
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
At the request of

1346
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,383
Boris Johnson

1347
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,199
Which

1348
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,247
Probably not great ones

1349
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
You realize all of that is

1350
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
What some

1351
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,391
Simpsons writer wrote

1352
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,415
2010

1353
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:49,535
Like not literally but

1354
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
Pointless calendar

1355
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,399
Eventually took over the

1356
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
F****** UK government

1357
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
Aynax

1358
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
And successfully

1359
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,287
Garcia

1360
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,871
That's banana it's pretty wild

1361
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,199
So Alex is a slightly different

1362
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:15,647
Obviously that's behind

1363
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,463
But it turns out he likes the queen

1364
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,479
No no no

1365
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,247
No

1366
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:47,135
No no no no it's a little misleading to say that the queen suspend Parliament

1367
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,975
It's more the case that Boris Johnson

1368
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
Okay

1369
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,071
That's kind of parole though it is ceremonial

1370
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,679
She began to legitimately meddle in the Affairs of government directly real problem

1371
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:05,311
The Monarch is rolls like appointing the Prime Minister but that doesn't mean that the queen just gets to choose whatever she wants

1372
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,103
Does prime minister hope you f***** up

1373
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:12,479
Johnson's request for probably lead to a greater likelihood of a No Deal brexit

1374
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,039
Disastrous outcomes for the British economy

1375
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:18,367
Way out of line for her to not except

1376
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
Because he's the head of

1377
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,303
Experts consulted by the BBC said quote impossible for the queen to turn down the price

1378
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Service request

1379
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:33,983
Like literally for heard of rejected the request would have led to a whole different conversation about the return of monarchic rule

1380
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,519
I would have said a horrible president

1381
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,567
Really would have been

1382
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,127
Like it would have been really funny

1383
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
Speaking well

1384
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,295
Because from my position

1385
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:53,695
I'm looking at this and I'm seeing that in the very recent past very clearly that the queen and her in Thai

1386
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,743
Lydia

1387
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,863
Of a decade-long the One World Government

1388
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,143
They're legitimately

1389
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
Evil incarnate

1390
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,215
And every single thing you said about the

1391
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,495
British royal family

1392
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
Has been over the top

1393
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,311
And cartoonishly skating

1394
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,639
Did he him now be like that.

1395
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:19,039
It's an absurd narrative shift that you tell anyone

1396
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,439
All of this up as he goes along the very end of her life

1397
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
All of those

1398
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
Blood

1399
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Fusionzone

1400
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,375
Adventure acknowledge

1401
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
And Trump

1402
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
And The Patriot

1403
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
Send a picture

1404
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,239
It's so weird

1405
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:44,639
I thought that might just be a throwaway like now

1406
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:48,479
Talk about we're supposed to kill the queen two episodes ago

1407
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Probably

1408
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,319
A blues track

1409
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,623
Arrestor

1410
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:00,255
But I also think that was in 2013

1411
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,143
I thought

1412
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,447
Your queen

1413
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
But

1414
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
He does get back to it a little bit later

1415
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
So

1416
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
He first

1417
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
Needs to

1418
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,759
Like I said the beginning resep

1419
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,087
Alex's Behavior was

1420
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
Is it all

1421
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,951
Notable after Trump insulted Fox News

1422
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,975
Animed

1423
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
An indication

1424
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,583
Shinto like we need a new outlet which does open up

1425
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,863
Space for Alex

1426
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,679
I would have thought that maybe you'd be able to

1427
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Lucy some indications

1428
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,983
And there's not much

1429
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,775
But Fox News does come up

1430
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
Interested

1431
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
In Trump's

1432
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,151
Thick shiting on

1433
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,455
I want that

1434
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,295
Confronted by Fox host about criticizing the network

1435
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,855
Except for 45 host on there

1436
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
Because they're planning

1437
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
You ready

1438
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
Person test

1439
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
Election

1440
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,175
So are you

1441
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,319
Sure

1442
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,623
So I don't

1443
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,951
See him being all that interested in the actual conversation the tap

1444
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,767
About Fox News

1445
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,559
Which seems to be almost

1446
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,839
The best ploy

1447
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:53,407
The smoothest play which is out of character for

1448
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,431
Yeah

1449
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Is interest

1450
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,855
Could you have expected you would have expected him to

1451
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,135
Either have gone

1452
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,463
So far in the bootlicker direction of like

1453
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:11,583
Job I'm right here for you

1454
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,375
Or two

1455
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,423
Dancing on the grave of Fox News

1456
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,823
This kind of situation is forever and

1457
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,895
Right there eventually but it's

1458
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Cuz you should be

1459
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,503
Yeah based on everything about is prior actions

1460
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,623
Weird

1461
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:41,023
Ever three people to whom he remembers their name

1462
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,047
To Hong Kong

1463
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,351
There's another person in Hong Kong

1464
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,143
Others Paul Joseph Watson

1465
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:50,495
Goddamnit what was he

1466
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,775
I think

1467
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,799
Vagina

1468
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:57,151
It's a pretty consistent thing that I don't care about people's personal lives

1469
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,711
So I have not looked into Paul Joseph Watson

1470
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,527
Some personal life at all but I remember Alex saying

1471
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,319
Explain

1472
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,647
He's on

1473
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,719
And he has a little bit of

1474
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
An angle

1475
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
On the

1476
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
The situation

1477
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
And

1478
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:21,215
I think that this is really indicative of how Infowars is covering

1479
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
The protest

1480
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,335
Ridiculous partisan bickering

1481
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,151
Societies largely United

1482
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
Behind the protests

1483
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
Against

1484
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,295
Migration

1485
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,343
Which is super sing that Society

1486
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
It was a lie

1487
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
He said quote

1488
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,975
They drain our resources

1489
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,351
Making it increasingly

1490
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,007
With this Mass migration from the Middle East and North Africa

1491
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,967
Is being friends

1492
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:07,039
The China as a result of this Mass migration

1493
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,575
So

1494
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Just tried to

1495
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,743
Twist my arm into a f******

1496
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,279
Principal pretzel with that

1497
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Stupid

1498
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,071
Ill-informed

1499
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,351
Nonsense Aztecs

1500
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,679
Actually really enjoy

1501
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,007
Really sums up Infowars

1502
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,799
Position on the protest in Hong Kong

1503
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,591
It's purely an attempt

1504
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,127
The Coop the protest

1505
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,943
Interbeing about their Marquee issues

1506
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,223
Their number events

1507
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,319
Instances of this throughout the episode their coverage of the Hong Kong stuff

1508
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:45,695
Videos

1509
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,743
That's just like I was getting kicked off

1510
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:53,375
Do you know there's instances like that but I think that this is the clearest cut one where you can see the duplicitousness

1511
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
And the manipulation

1512
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:00,799
The people in Hong Kong have complained about people from mainland China coming to Hong Kong in a road in their political autonomy

1513
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,151
Alex and Paul Joseph Watson scream all day but the UMP

1514
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,711
Invading masses of third-world refugees

1515
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
To come to the United

1516
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,087

People voting against Alex's preferred political

1518
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,487
It doesn't take too much examination

1519
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
The massive

1520
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,303
Have them between those two arguments

1521
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,631
The close enough

1522
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,423
Did you blur the edges

1523
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,215
You can create a narrative that

1524
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,775
Yeah if you know nothing about either

1525
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,823
I mean they're basically just trying to

1526
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,591
To take

1527
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,175
Big similarities

1528
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,223
And try and turn it into like

1529
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:50,463
Play how they're covering it which is one of the reasons why even if

1530

Protests in Hong Kong

1532
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,839
You still can survive without

1533
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
Now.

That's

1548
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,047
I feel like that's an unhealthy

Specially for like

1579
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,600
He's running out of gas also worth noting

United right by

1582
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,800
I don't know why he wouldn't

1583
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,872
Based on every other thing he's ever said in his

1584
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
F****** life

1585
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:55,296
He wouldn't think that another world war was also orchestrated in order to create something on the other end of it

1588
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,960
I was blown away

1589
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,520
Because I had that moment while he was listening to

1590
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
Is he

1591
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
Sing the queen over

1592
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
It's not like she

1593
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,408
She's just that

1594
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,504
And then I was like oh no

1595
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,904
Is looking at boats and decided that

1596
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
It was right

1597
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:37,792
He's just a weird old lady with a lot of that I think he either thinks that

1598
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,120
He knows the reality but he thinks

1599
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,656
Narrative

1600
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,448
We flipped the queen

1601
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:49,568
Is much better for him because it's better for the

1602
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:54,176
American Patriot

1603
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,224
Subverting Parliament

1604
01:21:56,736 --> 01:22:00,832
Never been done in 400 years

1605
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,952
That's not good

1606
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,000
So the question of how long it's been

1607
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,280
And something like this is

1608
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,584
Define what happen

1609
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:17,472
Technically Parliament is disbanded basically every year for a break

1610
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:20,288
Boris Johnson is arguing that that's all of this

1611
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,152
That's clearly a live by the pro No Deal brexit

1612
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
Supporters

1613
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,992
It's business as usual

1614
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,600
Is the longest Parliament would have had since 90

1615
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,416
E-40 calls at the end of World War II

1616
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:43,072
What's interesting is Alex's using the brexit people's position in terms of

1617
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,144
But he's also wrong about it being 400 years ago

1618
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:50,240
Alex is referring to what happened back in 1629

1619
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,800
When King Charles the first dismiss Parliament

1620
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:56,128
They shouldn't be using that as an example of what's going on now

1621
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,920
Since it totally works against

1622
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,688
Does argument

1623
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,808
Charles dismiss Parliament because he believed that he had a divine right to be the sole ruler

1624
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,624
The bike's tension what's going on according to Alex

1625
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,160
This should be seen as a coup

1626
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,464
And a return to a democratic system

1627
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,512
But oh well isn't favor brexit

1628
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,560
It's our The Narrative WorkSource f******

1629
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,888
Then I go to bed

1630
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,424
Even without that historical

1631
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,192
Go Contacts

1632
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:24,032
He should see this is a COO

1633
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,664
He's a demon

1634
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,992
Right

1635
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,528
This actually give him

1636
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,600
Reason to pause and be like maybe I'm on the wrong side

1637
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:45,536
What is radius

1638
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,304
Position

1639
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,584
Conception of this is

1640
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120

Is creating One World repressive system is all of a sudden pretty cool with me

1644
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,920
What you're doing

1645
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:08,320
Yeah I know I said a lot about it and that breakfast

1646
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
Great toe

1647
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,392
We got

1648
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
The birth

1649
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,560
This to me is why this is so important

1650
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,608
That indicates so strongly

1651
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,656
That none of the things he's ever said

1652
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:27,520
About the queen about the monarchy

1653
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056

1655
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,688
Years that I would normally wouldn't

1656
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,504
But the only reason I am only 10 years old

1657
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:41,344
But the only reason I am is because Alex made a big deal of the big

1658
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,928
400 round

1659
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,256
If you're going to say

1660
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,560
He said it's a big round number means

1661
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,400
Providence

1662
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,704

420 years

1665
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,200
From our position Alex should believe this is

1666
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,272
And not Democratic thing

1667
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,600
Sure

1668
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,184
It is

1669
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,584
She's just doing exactly what ceremony demands that she otherwise

1670
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,960
I'll be f***** up it would lead to better conclusion possibly

1671
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
Right

1672
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:36,384
The complete British government code

1673
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,200
It would be in Simpsonville there is no good

1674
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,784

1675
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,368
There is a ridiculous.

1676
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,256
Alex should be strongly against

1677
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,048
Send

1678
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,584
He knows

1679
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
Fit what she's doing

1680
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,888
Isn't it

1681
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,496
There's a bunch of pedophiles

1682
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,520
Salute

1683
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:08,640
What

1684
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,064
Just flipped her dictator switch

1685
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:16,832
What

1686
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
And so she just dropped

1687
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,632
This is his story

1688
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,192
All I got to say so

1689
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,312
Going to be spectacular

1690
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,176
The world

1691
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,760
Structure

1692
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,040
Two fronts

1693
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,488
I will side with the last

1694
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,304
Hughes

1695
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,888
Also pitching this as a war against Islam

1696
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:07,008
And all that

1697
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:14,432
The

1698
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,248
Alex fields

1699
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,784
But there's a holy aspect

1700
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,624
To this new world war

1701
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,648
Right

1702
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,696
Unhealthy

1703
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
Yeah

1704
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,512
Well we've never had people who thought that way

1705
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Forever

1706
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:34,912
It's also a position you've really really don't like to hear out of a staunch isolationist

1707
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,960
Intervention

1708
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:45,664
Paul guy

1709
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,456
Get involved in Florida

1710
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:53,856
I want to World War

1711
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,928
I don't even know what

1712
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
What to say about

1713
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,232
Someone who's

1714
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,560
Putting forth position

1715
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,608
Not just

1716
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,144
Advocating

1717
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,960
For a World War

1718
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,496
About the prospect

1719
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,032
Because he is

1720
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:22,784
We got our side now it's just like those other world wars

1721
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,832
No one died in

1722
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
Craziest

1723
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,928
Almost done 11

1724
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
It's so callous

1725
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:30,976
Yeah

1726
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:35,072
It reminds me so much of a

1727
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,352
Patton Oswalt joke about

1728
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,912
Wouldn't you want to die

1729
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,680
Apocalypse

1730
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:45,568
You know I don't want to know how did you die over the super boring but apocalypse

1731
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
That kinda

1732
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,736
Are you really does want to die in the epochal

1733
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
That's because then he's a

1734
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,832
He's one of the final men

1735
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,952
So in this clip

1736
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,256
The episode

1737
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,304
From break and really get into

1738
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,120
The situation with the queen

1739
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400
Solve that Queens

1740
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,960
Just leads me to believe

1741
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,856
A deal with the EU

1742
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,072
Control

1743
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,864
We got to get Lord mantra.

1744
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:47,264
Why do they

1745
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,592
Anymore

1746
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:53,664
So we can still get monster

1747
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
Probably

1748
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,504
So

1749
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,272
I mean

1750
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,064
The idea that this is like

1751
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,088
Queen decree

1752
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
Situation

1753
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:11,584
Amanda presentation of it as they did this to have more time to negotiate

1754
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Is also

1755
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,680
The completely out of line with every reading

1756
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,960
I've had about this

1757
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,776
Every person who's no one

1758
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:23,616
Is presented

1759
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,640
Results

1760
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,944
It's a clear attempt

1761
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,968
To sabotage

1762
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,248
Negotiation

1763
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,528
Cancel the part of

1764
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,064
Boris

1765
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,624
He is allowed to speak in public without

1766
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
For lying

1767
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
Straight Talk

1768
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,488
Like what

1769
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,328
Like everything that you said about why they're doing that

1770
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,120
So bald-faced

1771
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,168
Like he might as well have a

1772
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:50,752
The sign that says I'm lying directly above his head while he says

1773
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,080
You should

1774
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,152
Try harder the

1775
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,432
Stay out

1776
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:01,248
I told you that's the last normal

1777
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,832
Surreal

1778
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,624
How to play I told you earlier

1779
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,416
Amazon Play commercial

1780
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
The real commercial

1781
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:13,024
Episode

1782
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,304
We've been seeing this

1783
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,328
Trend in the

1784
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:22,752
Upsetting like I want American expansionism to come back right

1785
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,032
Buy Greenland

1786
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:27,104
Who cares anyway it's on there

1787
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
12 million dollars

1788
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,944
You have

1789
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,016
Just like real domestic problem

1790
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,552
The way you sees the United

1791
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
Red State

1792
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,344
And now you're seeing

1793
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,952
The Hong Kong protest

1794
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
And then after

1795
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,000
The same time

1796
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,304
Encouraging and supporting

1797
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,120
Phrasing the idea of Another World War

1798
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,400
Damn you just have like

1799
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
One of the most

1800
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,448
Bucked up

1801
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,984
Autoline dude

1802
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,776
Episode

1803
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
Like just bouncing back in

1804
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
Fourth from

1805
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,664
Firearm

1806
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,944
Political alignment

1807
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,016
They are co-opting

1808
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,064
A protest against

1809
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,624
Oppressive authoritarian regime

1810
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,184
To prop up

1811
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,280
Their preferred oppressive authoritarian regime

1812
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,584
Supporting protesters

1813
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,864
Ostensibly wallet

1814
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,632
At the same time

1815
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,912
Supporting

1816
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
A return to a monarchy

1817
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,800
In the UK

1818
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:32,640
His perception of the ACT

1819
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,176
It's her not

1820
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,736
Interfering

1821
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:40,064
Government inappropriately

1822
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:47,232
Pushing the dictator button but what I'm saying is we're just bouncing around from different angles on oppressive

1823
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,256
Authoritarian regime

1824
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:51,840
Depending on Ultimate Lee doesn't matter to him he wants

1825
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,632
Authoritarianism

1826
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,400
He just wants it to be

1827
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,728
Is China in the middle right

1828
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,288
In order to achieve that I guess

1829
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,592
To do with anything other than they don't look like

1830
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,432
Don't feel like there's much more going on

1831
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
So

1832
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,528
The last we leave with that bitter pill

1833
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,320
Still lingering on our tongue

1834
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,368
I present to you George

1835
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,416
A commercial that Alex has

1836
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,952
For his new Proto

1837
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,720
Bars

1838
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,256
This

1839
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,536
Is so f***** up

1840
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
I mean

1841
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,888
I honestly understand that this is an attempt to be funny

1842
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:29,216
And there's a portion of me that thinks like this is kind of funny

1843
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
You'll see you'll visit

1844
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:38,944
Well today then poured high protein bar

1845
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:44,576
I just put Ballard your cousin in 45 protein bar

1846
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:51,232
I need

1847
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:04,032
Walmart tires Walmart

1848
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:37,824
I can't hear anything other than a response to our theme song

1849
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:45,248
Either that or he's gone

1850
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,368
No way

1851
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,416
Pictures of problems with that

1852
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,976
He would never buy into that b*******

1853
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,000
Japanese

1854
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,024
Sharp edge

1855
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,608
The big the big joke that he has in there I guess

1856
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,376
Is

1857
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:07,008
Looking at

1858
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
Your cousin

1859
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:15,456
It's the bars cuz I love that so much is a complete non sequitur

1860
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:20,064
In context

1861
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,392
When I hear that

1862
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,440
A couple times

1863
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Just goes

1864
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,048
It was bizarre plays a couple times

1865
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
The thing is like

1866
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,888
If you really listen to it

1867
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,680
They couldn't admit that

1868
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,984
Put it together without some clips

1869
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
Free sounds

1870
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:39,776
Completely dry

1871
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,592
So f***** up

1872
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,896
I generally thought they were

1873
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,944
I'd like altering the audio

1874
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:53,344
I think in order to make it match whatever but like

1875
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,368
I'm good

1876
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,952
And then also if you watch the video of the commercial

1877
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:03,072
It's the same thing with that that clip with him drinking the bone broth what he looks

1878
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:07,936
Disgusted by it out of the protein bar

1879
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:08,960
Like

1880
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,008
A person enjoying approach

1881
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,848
Kevin it's like how much protein

1882
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:21,760
Todd look at it

1883
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,784
Greens or whatever

1884
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,856
12 to 20 g of protein

1885
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,928
I hearing the words Infowars protein bar I'm like

1886
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,488
You can't make a thing out of that much protein

1887
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,304
75 G protein

1888
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:38,400
All it is is a muscle muscle

1889
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,984
It's called the constipation

1890
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,568
Delicious vanilla

1891
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:50,176
I feel little bit qualms with playing that even

1892
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,576
Gmi2

1893
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:59,136
I'm not threatening its kind of awake

1894
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:01,440
Penetrate

1895
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:07,840
When did that is

1896
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,632
Little bait on the hook

1897
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,448
But at the same time

1898
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,616
Desperate for any memes

1899
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,664
Promoting himself

1900
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,968
So many Avenues are blocked off to him

1901
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,016
He's become so inundated in this

1902
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,296
Weird memes

1903
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,600
Kind of sphere

1904
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,136
This is what you

1905
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,928
Forced to do

1906
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,512
I know you look older

1907
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,304
You're still 45

1908
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,328
This is

1909
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,888
Becoming Behavior primble 4508

1910
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,216
Sounds exactly like a Japanese

1911
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,032
Commercial that John Travolta would have started right

1912
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
Before you baby

1913
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
Is comeback in Tulsa

1914
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,616
You know whenever is like

1915
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,152
You're losing your hair

1916
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,432
You're not going to make it

1917
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:58,784
Go to Japan do a couple commercials get a quick cash out and then come back and

1918
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,808
Tarantino robot

1919
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,000
From

1920
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,536
Don't think this is moving protein

1921
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,328
I just put more protein in

1922
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
Nice bar

1923
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:15,168
Through

1924
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,192
Exhausted

1925
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:21,568
We survived in one piece

1926
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:24,640
Passionate about

1927
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,920
This

1928
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
Stretch of time

1929
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,992
I don't feel all that

1930
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:31,552
Like interested in it it's not

1931
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,320
Yeah

1932
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,368
Alex is not into

1933
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,184
All that much

1934
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,512
Department

1935
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:41,792
That's a part of it

1936
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,864
He's just a razor Superior rating into like

1937
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,680
A complete monster but I already know he's a monster

1938
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
So

1939
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,496
Much revelation

1940
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,520
End of

1941
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,336
Nothing

1942
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,360
Co-op these

1943
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,384
These protests

1944
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,432
Pretty f*****-up

1945
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,968
To misrepresent

1946
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
Queen

1947
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:07,392
It's f***** up in the sense that it reveals so much about how little is narratives mean

1948
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,952
Change it like the Rothschilds could become good

1949
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,744
Right

1950
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,560
Just one day's work

1951
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:18,144
1 days worth Rothschild's could be rehab

1952
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,448
And Alex is a narrative

1953
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:24,288
There's that I guess there's some value to that but

1954
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
I don't know

1955
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,592
I need a

1956
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,128
Alex

1957
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,664
Consider this

1958
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,480
Editorial note

1959
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392

1961
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:46,816

1963

1965

How to get Spotify

1970
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,744

1971
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,024
Have to go to a

1972
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,048
Fairy ring

1973
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,840

I'm Neo I'm Leo
