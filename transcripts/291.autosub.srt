Who's your favorite movie

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
I don't like scary movies but also talked about Like the Wolf

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:33,792
Real monsters I didn't like

5
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
But I did like the song The Monster

6
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
Okay

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,544
I want to talk about my

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,128
I want talk with something real quick

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,712
No I knew about all of Boris Pickett

10
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
Other songs

11
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
Swim

12
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,600
And the sequel to The Monster Mash and the climate Mash

13
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,232
Yeah okay

14
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,472
A long time ago

15
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,360
Kind of credibility in my trying to clean. I don't feel like I can talk about my

16
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,896
Love of the idea that he just

17
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
Captivating Go song

18
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Because

19
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Point that out

20
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,880
It's not a novel observation for me and that's pretty much my relation

21
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Zip with monster

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
Who's your favorite universe

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Classic movie monsters that's what came to my mind

24
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
There we go

25
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,968
1 time for a live show I wrote the holiday show

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
Pick of the Monster Mash 2

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
I don't remember

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,048
I don't remember exactly but it was like

29
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Facebook podcast

30
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,288
About to the Monster Mash song parody

31

Long-lost

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,176
Incorrect

34
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
That's correct

35
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Which will be a humdinger

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
As I told you over text

37
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,000

I don't think that I can over selfie

40
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
Wonderful

45
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,256
I could do

46
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280

Watch The Postman

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,560
These are all right I was thinking it was

51
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
From the movie The Postman

52
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
El Postino

00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,056
He was also in Waterworld, Connecticut

Also finally

55
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
Although much like a paper crafts

56
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites a bucket of poop

The tri-state area has been randomly hit by measles so you've heard the bad news

62
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
The bad news

63
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
People people have

64
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,479
I we are now below

65
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
That's exactly like how my life goes

66
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Cousin

67
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Going to get this tattoo

68

Butts

69
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,495
I'll get to that

70
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,311
Maybe another documentary

71
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
People are interested in that

72
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
Could

73
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,671
Maybe we don't have the technology

74
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,303
Wacky Wednesday

For you for you

77

Yeah

78
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
Okay you know what you know what this is

79
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
One of the things that I value

80
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
About doing Wacky Wednesday

81
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
Alex Jones

82
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
Being able to tell stories

83
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Google to get into

84
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
And

85
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
What I'm about to

86
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Present in front of you

87
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Is a

88
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Literally insane

89
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,983
Things I learned about

90
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,543
Something I was working on it still

91
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
And that is

92
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
Are you ready I am never been more in suspense as to whether or not this is truly a hump day

93
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
It's awesome.

94
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,111
Last episode of Adventures

95
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Convicted murderer Mark Richard

96
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Music actually

97
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
A secret space program

98
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
On that last time do we look

99
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
Tell Mark is full of s***

100
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
After

101
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,567
Trailer for that document

102
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
The story of Mark Richards is absolutely wanted

103
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
More attention

104
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
Is it true crime

105
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Angle

106
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
That's a love story you know both with Mark and his wife and with Mark and the Raptor princess who's in space

107
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,071
No alerts for the high card

108
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
This story has it all really it does so the ideal humidity about it obviously I'd like

109
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
But

110
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
I got very excited about the possibility that someone who had the funding

111
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,711
Interview people involved in the murder that Mark committed

112
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
Carrie I got really excited about that possibility what we could

113
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Compliment

114
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
My tone was very positive about

115
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,559
On the trailer which

116
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Hilarious Moments Mercury cast

117
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
He tries to convince the

118
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
The filmmaker

119
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
That Mark was off-planet when the murder happened and is friends with raptor

120
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,335
But the more I thought about it the more something

121
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Fit right

122
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,759
Who was this guy making this documentary

123
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
Find out the guy who makes the documentary is even crazier than

124
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
What I realized

125
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Aries accusation that he

126
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,351
The dildo salesman

127
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Cast of The Reptilian

128
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
He's right on that I realize what I really

129
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
He knew about it

130
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,431
Is there anything I tried to do on this podcast as much as I can

131
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Especially

132
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
I don't know nearly enough about this British guys making this documentary about a subject that we've covered on our show pretty much since we saw

133
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Started doing the show

134
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,815
So I set out to learn a little bit more about this guy

135
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
And that's what we're going to be talkin about here today

136
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
You're convinced three children to murder

137
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
He's mad at Mark Richards cuz he took his record

138
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
If you take Kevin at his word here is his rationale for why about Mark

139
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
This is the first docu-series

140
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
Orbitz kind

141
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Communities that are represent

142
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
As well

143
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
To the communities

144
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,823
Is a credible research

145
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Two people

146
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
When people trying to explore

147
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
There's a greater reality

148
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
And when it's met with misinformation and disinformation

149
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,719
You know that's something that I can't

150
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Cooling right now

151
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
2

152
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Show The Office

153
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
What's this song

154
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Some of these so-called whistleblowers

155
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
Use that you may seem like

156
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
Little bit overly capricious

157
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
Like you're being a little bit overly judgmental based on

158
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
What you assume is

159
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Going to happen

160
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,807
Like what

161
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,135
Write well but that means I can mean a whole bunch of different things

162
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,231
If you take there are credible researchers in

163
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
In the field and people like Mark

164
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Derrida service

165
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
Abby's always people who are actively searching

166
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
I think there are

167
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
People who aren't crazy who are into aliens

168
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,079
And stuff like that

169
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
But just boil down

170
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Blind Center

171
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,087
Motivation for making a documentary

172
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,903
He reiterates that here in this next clip

173
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Why did I do it well it was

174
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
It was just to try to

175
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
Give us some contacts in the stories that are out that nowadays

176
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
What riches is one story

177
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:22,751
There are so many other stores how many how much disinformation do you think there is in the field

178
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
You get the sense that this is really how you presented the motivation

179
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Embarking on this documentary

180
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
About Mark Richards actually being a murderer

181
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Joanne Richard

182
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
These people were full of s***

183
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,159
And helping him push his story on the map

184
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
So

185
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Is this Fair

186
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
Is this complete b*******

187
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Only time will tell

188
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,167
You know a couple hours ago now

189
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,751
You have a pretty good idea in a couple hours

190
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Kevin Moore has a YouTube channel

191
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
2011

192
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
What he posted a teaser trailer for his forthcoming

193
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Show called The Maury Show

194
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:10,367
This is a show that he was trying to sell to people that was vaguely a spiritualist talk show

195
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
On which you would interview writers and actors from the UK

196
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
As well as astronomers and political Act

197
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Being a pretty normal show

198
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
But just with a slight undercurrent of new-age

199
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Yeah what time

200
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,543
As far as I'm not going to buy into everything you say

201
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Trying to get into

202
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
Like a non-aggressive new age

203
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Nonsense

204
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
Threatening

205
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,783
I can enjoy that for a little while

206
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
While I'm bored

207
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415
Matthew's Baldwin

208
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,487
Interview with Stanley Kubrick

209
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Musician

210
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
There were a few apparently

211
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Playing interview

212
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Pretty quickly

213
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Turned into a conspiracy new age

214
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Theme

215
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,543
Became the clear focus of the show started to talk to Freemason

216
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
People who called themselves color psychic

217
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
Okay I don't know what that means

218
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,879
No talking to a bunch of folks wanted to tell you how imminent UFO disclosure

219
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Right around the corner

220
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
But all the while straightforward

221
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Would still make appearances

222
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
And you would have interviews with guests like David prowse

223
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Who played Darth Vader

224
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
Add that Jo Frost from the show Supernanny

225
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,591
Kernel of tethering

226
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,575
Back in 2011 America's collapsing economy

227
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,439
With frequent Alex Jones

228
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Bear

229
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Paul Craig Roberts

230
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
Possibly worse or at least certainly more boring

231
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
Kevin also had an interview with Jerome corsi

232
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
A few years back

233
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
So you can see

234
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
Just one

235
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Appoint

236
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Similarities

237
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
There's overlap

238
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Shirtless

239
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Through

240
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
As time went on

241
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Towards

242
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Spiritualism stuff take

243
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Tweet Center

244
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,319
Becoming the primary topic of pretty much all of his videos

245
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
We're talkin about constant interviews a psychic

246
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Astrologist to past life regression

247
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Kevin Blanchard interviews with

248
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Big names in the field

249
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
David Icke

250
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
And on January 29th

251
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
2012 he posted an interview with Kerry Cassidy

252
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
3 herself

253
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
It was mostly a softball interview about how Project Camelot was a portal for whistleblowers

254
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
But ultimately the content

255
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Nearly as enter

256
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
First thing is the fact that it is

257
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
Right so we're not going to listen to

258
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,807
I will tell you you can go

259
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
He is in no way critical of her

260
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
He doesn't push back against her

261
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Sort of

262
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Very

263
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Nonsensical

264
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Also

265
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
On June 10th 2012

266
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:10,079
Kevin shouldn't be judged too harshly about this aspect

267
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Called

268
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
It was a FEMA drill to promote gun

269
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,039
Control

270
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,391
Probably should sleep or not.

271
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,695
Jim Fetzer the literal Holocaust denier

272
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,279
But maybe that was an open question is

273
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
Publix at there was about as not

274
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
Sympathy at this

275
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
Okay so there's a possibility

276
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
But this dude has Renee

277
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Previous life

278
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
And is

279
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Making this documentary

280
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
As a as almost

281
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,735
As a wave

282
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
I love you thinking

283
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
About ideas

284
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Impossible

285
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,815
Whatever kind of plausible deniability you might have about like

286
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
The late twenties

287
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
12 interview with him

288
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
You don't have it anymore you should take that s*** the f*** off

289
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,335
Cuz he goes around

290
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
Content but snobbery contact

291
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
Workout is at

292
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
TV talk-show it lived on

293
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
You're a tell Kevin about it

294
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,999
Leavenworth is magical

295
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
That's on YouTube

296
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
I guess it's podcast

297
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Can't find it.

298
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Distribution strategy of this

299
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
But I don't know how

300
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,687
Widely distributed

301
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,039
Some sort of like Satellite Channel

302
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,671
Possible from what I could tell was pretty short-lived

303
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Late night

304
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Weirdo show

305
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
We are in the present day 2019

306
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
Kevin Moore has rebranded

307
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Into a voice of steps

308
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,287
Decision is making the documentary about how Mark Richards is a murderer who defrauded everyone into

309
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
He puts up frequent vlogs

310
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
YouTube channel that often

311
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
About how is documentary

312
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Is going to undo all the damage

313
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
The curry is done

314
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Still makes me wonder how

315
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
Stop

316
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:43,167
And that is the secret space program

317
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
Opinion

318
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
Every minute of my time

319
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
So I would say

320
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,063
You know he's not really taking the high road

321
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,903
Project

322
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
Understand an excuse a little bit of that Agro tone

323
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
Benny has

324
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
In that last clip about like you notes

325
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,911
Worth all the work

326
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Similarly

327
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
Exasperate

328
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,591
But he's addressing her and Joanne Richards

329
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
In this Walk That You released from April 9th

330
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
2009

331
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
This is what you should have done in the first place

332
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Embarrassment

333
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Gets hot whistleblower

334
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,663
I understand the idea that

335
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Ghetto carries been

336
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
I'd like to cheese.

337
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
It makes

338
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
Exasperate

339
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
The way the carries responding to him

340
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,935
She said that like really inept

341
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,895
Almost incomprehensible write-up about it

342
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Harassment

343
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
For us

344
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
People completely detached

345
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
From the reality of all this

346
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Who's the funny story

347
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,927
Crazy guy in prison

348
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
But for other people this is

349
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Real life

350
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,559
Richard Baldwin was a real person who was murdered

351
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,399
His family lost a loved one that day when barking Crossing Hoover killed

352
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Mark and crossings family set

353
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
How to deal with the pain

354
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
A relative committed murder

355
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,103
I don't have to carry and work through the stigma that comes along with that ever since

356
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Has Kevin Wright

357
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
Squid from the introduction

358
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Trailer for his documentary

359
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,575
Mercurial Jo-Ann's who has a negative effect on the people most hurt

360
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
5 marks crime

361
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Leonid Stoltz

362
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
Surviving member of

363
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
Susan Baldwin

364
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
He was devastated

365
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Books that Carrie and Joe

366
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Giving me

367
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
The platform that they are

368
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
Dispute

369
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
His misinformation

370
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Make make sense

371
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,615
I figured something like that would be really funny

372
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,455
Ruby kind of hilarious as well I don't know it turned out that on March

373
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,527
28 2015 Kevin Moore gave Joanne Richards

374
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,623
Formation about the secret space program

375
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
And heroic

376
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Husband Captain Mark Ritchie

377
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,767
I should be clear I'm not calling him Captain Mark Richard

378
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,351
Kevin Moore credits

379
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
In the video that he put out

380
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Captain Mark Richards

381
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,287
That's even in the description of the video Captain Mark Richards

382
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,663
Which

383
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,063
He credited Marc Richards as a captain when he interviewed Joanne

384
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
Play the little bit ago I don't know how

385
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,000
In our community and that was a big red flag for me there

386
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,400
Hold on to

387
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,776
Inter-Community

388
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
Joe

389
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,968
To New Age and spiritual

390
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
So Kevin Moore is now working on a documentary about how Mark Richards is a murdering people shouldn't be treating him like a legitimate

391
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Information

392
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
So I feel like maybe it's in our best

393
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
Pinterest to check in

394
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,048
Etsy just handled himself when he had the chance

395
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:59,936
Either push back or accept the b******* that marks wife was telling him when she was a guest on his

396
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Show

397
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,824
I figured you probably already guessed that if you did a good job

398
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:13,248
Complete f****** idiot while Joanne Richards lies to him about her murder her husband

399
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Space Adventures

400
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
Is pathetic

401
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
So are dispersed Cliff Kevin

402
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,208
Introduces Joanne as his guest

403
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
For this episode

404
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
No Joanne riches is the wife

405
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Democracy

406
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Who claims he was in office

407
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
As well as variac

408
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Chris PACE program

409
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
And US space command

410
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,872
So right out of the gate

411
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:46,272
Maybe this is just him like giving her the benefit of the

412
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
You know

413
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,304
The part in terms of Champions interview Style

414
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
Talking about the actual murder

415
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,920
Somebody who's lying about

416
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Interested

417
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
He's not a murderer you asked about the murder is an open question

418
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
Okay is or isn't a murderer in the question

419
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
The work of the liar for that

420
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Don't establish

421
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,472
The truth of the answer in advance

422
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
Scuse me

423
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
Yes or no question

424
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
This is a very strong indication

425
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Kevin is either

426
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
The worst person at his job

427
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,576
Or you actively participating in what Joanne wants

428
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
What's to do here on this

429
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Tell me

430
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
A bit about the background

431
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
2

432
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
Story

433
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
Of the

434
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Because I believe this well

435
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
That

436
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,032
He wasn't even he was away on a mission that's not good

437
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,128
Oh that's really not good in the cuisine

438
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,528
Establishes that Mark was off-planet now all Joanne has to do is say yes I O

439
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:27,904
I agree with that

440
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
He has done the heavy lifting for her

441
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,816
This is a collaborative interview where Mark Richards murder is

442
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
Or is the end result

443
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
But the audience is being walked towards

444
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Blind

445
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:49,408
Stumbling through this f****** interview because maybe what he meant to say was

446
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,480
I believe your story is that he wasn't even off

447
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
I think when you're talking about stuff like this

448
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Little more careful

449
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,768
Probably a couple years later you take the horsepower that you do

450
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Against

451
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,608
This very person who your interview about yourself

452
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,936
And tacitly

453
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
So we both know the murder happened

454
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
And he wasn't around for it so tell me more about that

455
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,088
Completely open to the idea that he was off the planet

456
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
It's been whatever narrative she wants

457
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,048
Lackadaisical about a murder victim

458
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,680
So now then to go to the murder of in 1982 a murder happens

459
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Here

460
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:51,360
In one of his cover business

461
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
Mrs. forget his military stuff

462
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Was

463
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
Remodeling people's houses or or whatever

464
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,112
Doing a remodeling project at a friend's house

465
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
And the guy also had a business

466
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Restoring antique

467
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Cars

468
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,560
What my husband didn't know at the time was that the guy was also

469
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
The filming child pronography in his house

470
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
And he was a drug dealer

471
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Sajid

472
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Go to lunch well then leave

473
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,872
Kids that works for my husband cuz my husband had a

474
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
Cheddar's

475
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
And had a habit of hiring

476
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Basically juvenile delinquents

477
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Ali's kids

478
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Kill the guy

479
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
And

480
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,160
When they started getting in trouble or whatever they just said my husband

481
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
Masterminded the whole thing

482
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
So what's up

483
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
He allows Joanne Richards

484
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
To assert

485
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
The person who her husband

486
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
Was responsible for murdering

487
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
Was a c****************

488
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,064
He introduced murder into his life but it's not really that big a deal because the Dude is a child pornographer

489
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Degenerate

490
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,904
Hired child delinquent then we all know that

491
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Murder solved

492
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
He allows Joanne

493
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
To say that

494
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Which is not backed up by any

495
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
There is no

496
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
Proof.

497
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
That's slander

498
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,336
That she's committing against this guy is that

499
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Kevin doesn't ask any follow-up question

500
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,576
She doesn't hold on

501
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Because anything

502
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Grapes

503
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Richard Baldwin

504
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,288
At the same time

505
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896
Is part of the Corpus of information that's being presented

506
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
To do his listeners

507
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
Which makes me remember this clip

508
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
From just a little bit ago

509
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,856
You know I met your sole surviving member of a family

510
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
Susan Baldwin

511
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
That Carrie and Joe

512
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
The platform that they are

513
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,936
Wonder wonder if you discussed your own behavior in that meeting

514
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
In this next clip

515
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,664
You just allows Joanne more about it

516
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Something

517
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Any.

518
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Interviewer

519
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
What

520
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
The f*** are you talking about

521
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,880
Do they change the date of death of the Vic

522
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,696
Turn three times to make sure it was a Thailand Marquess

523
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
What okay what

524
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:56,448
Can you back that up in literally any way what is death

525
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,032
Alibis

526
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
Go stupid

527
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,408
Check if you read the transcript of the interview and Mark got arrested

528
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
Any Alibis he had

529
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,760
Not

530
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:15,392
He was eating a sandwich with his parents or something like that backup alibi

531
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
Bulshit

532
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
No absolutely not

533
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,096
So in this next clip

534
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
Jojo

535
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
Discusses the idea that

536
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
Mark was off-planet

537
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
Whenever this murder happened

538
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
Close attention to the way

539
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
She's talking

540
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
You might get the sense

541
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Mark

542
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Say that

543
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Antigo interviewer

544
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
Might ask a follow-up question

545
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,256
About like what are you talkin about

546
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
Who knows

547
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
He has Alibis for the other day since

548
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,728
He might even have an alibi for the day he was off on a mission but

549
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
Now at least

550
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,568
Implies or will say I

551
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
Probably wasn't there

552
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,224
That's not good

553
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,296
Fly

554
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,624
Interviewer worth their salt okay

555
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
You

556
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
I got to go

557
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,232
So is there any reason why

558
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
As opposed to

559
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Specifically

560
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
You know and I know he

561
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
It's trying to tell me I was off doing something else

562
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,384
You know and I can go do that within an 8-hour Spanish

563
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
Oh really okay

564
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,248
You can't and won't tell me where he is

565
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,576
Where he was or what he was doing or how he got there

566
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
I strongly believe

567
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
He was not

568
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
In town

569
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
The Day of the Dead

570
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
Let's go let's go let's go

571
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Briefly summarize

572
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
That

573
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:12,128
You understand that that is not a follower

574
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,480
What is the amazing what are the

575
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
Set me up

576
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
Pretty ball yeah

577
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
Images wallpaper

578
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,560
Everything you told me is true

579
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
Let's summarize what it is

580
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
I mean

581
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,288
Basically just comes down to I chosen to believe that

582
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Do this

583
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:46,176
Tell me where he was

584
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
Which I would argue it

585
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,272
Just speaking as myself is the definition

586
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,904
Wasn't there

587
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,744
So I believe that Kevin as the interviews like

588
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Well yeah

589
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Let's hear about

590
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
Cool

591
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,704
Sound

592
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,264
Great yeah I mean that's a pathetic

593
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm interviewing of

594
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
Sympathetic level of Base conversation

595
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
It's very bad

596
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,672
He's trying to get to the

597
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
Score of

598
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,512
Information now

599
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
He's been in prison

600
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,096
For quite a while what's the

601
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Accidentally

602
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,568
Reveals that like

603
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,384
Why now because

604
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,296
Maybe the first 10 years of prison there was still a chance of him getting out through legal channels

605
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
Exhausted pretty much all his legal remedies

606
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,976
And after 10-15 years of prison he was pretty tired of prison

607
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,816
And so he decided Well I'm just going to start writing this

608
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,608
Stop that I'm just going to start

609
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,704
You know sharing some of this information that can be leaked out there

610
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,056
Because number one people will think he's crazy so they won't believe him anyway

611
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,384
And who's this little wife of his you know she must

612
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Be crazy if she believes him

613
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
That's just

614
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Exact

615
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
Diversion

616
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
One of the store you expect

617
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
From her butt look like

618
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Excuse board

619
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
Imprisoned

620
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,352
Yeah he's like writing fantasy novel

621
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
And she's like no it's

622
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:51,872
Elvis legal channel so he's kind of made peace with he's going to be there forever and he realized

623
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,968
Is that without that hope propelling him

624
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,320
Real

625
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,904
I don't think that's an offensive thing that she's

626
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,488
Push back at Aldi like

627
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
He's not just writing like

628
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
Syfy

629
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Considered

630
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:25,408
You are also exploiting him for a cottage industry

631
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,040
Is an interviewer that might be a bit Brusque

632
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
I think a better question would be

633
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Are you

634
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
You sure

635
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,400
Starts going off about how like all these

636
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
These countries work

637
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Together in

638
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
Can aliens work together with all of our countries

639
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Because

640
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
There's the appearance

641
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Seems everyone's work

642
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Together like

643
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
They did in the Cold War

644
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Put together behind the scenes

645
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Here to be because

646
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
This is a nonsensical idea

647
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Clip is important

648
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Because

649
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
Listen to how Kevin

650
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
Responding to her ideas

651
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
There's a collaborative aspect

652
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
He agrees with her and builds on

653
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Points that she's making

654
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
And when we were having the Cold War

655
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,728
Most of these countries were actually work

656
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
Working together when there was

657
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
Even though

658
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:30,176
Publicly say that but you had this agency that work together and told in

659
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
People from

660
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Many different country

661
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,576
The different militaries working together against a common threat so

662
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,392
You know they're all working together but they all have to keep it

663
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,976
Because I don't think the whole the world

664
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
In general

665
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Handle the truth

666
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
No absolutely not

667
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Some of the reasons why

668
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
As well

669
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
In the story

670
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Endorse

671
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
Like marks

672
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
Information

673
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
Explain why can't

674
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
Peter to get along but actually received

675
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
Secretly working together

676
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
And also

677
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
Agrees with her in that week

678
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
We cannot handle

679
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
No

680
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Nara

681
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Was there a code red

682
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
I don't know

683
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,288
As far as what she's talking about

684
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Richards

685
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,920
Just another weirdo since

686
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
I'm going to bed

687
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,784
It literally everything I own

688
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Smart

689
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,648
Then they're out

690
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
I bet that she gets them in for my

691
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,512
From Carrie as well

692
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
Community

693
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Or whatever

694
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
This one

695
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Because

696
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,032
Just got this in my bees

697
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
I didn't have a lot of Men In Black

698
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,128
Right so people like Mark Richards dad

699
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Deducted

700
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,712
Was just a man of me

701
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,552
Would you rather

702
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
Skylar

703
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,672
If I recall correctly

704
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,976
We're hanging out with Winston Churchill

705
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:25,376
When was 18 years older whatever

706
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
Weirdly too boring for me

707
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:36,640
He was really rich and really smart really cool and so he took on the role of being a man in Black

708
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
Because like you wanted to help Humanity

709
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
I wanted to help the country

710
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Reply

711
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,040
He was working alongside someone else

712
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
Heard of before

713
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,136
It is comical to hear of in this context

714
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,024
You know we didn't have a lot of Men In Black or whatever so you had rich young men or Young Rich Man

715
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
Who wanted to help the government

716
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,400
Select Barry Goldwater and

717
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:04,544
Actors and told people where they wanted to help

718
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,336
So there was a lot of

719
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
If there was that

720
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
Interesting stuff going on under

721
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Nobody knew about this

722
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,064
Doing stuff as a teenager and after the war

723
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
He was involved with investigating

724
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
Dealing with alien activity and UFO sightings

725
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
Barry Goldwater

726
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:30,400
Champs

727
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Totally

728
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
Okay

729
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
F****** crazy

730
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,592
So like at least

731
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,992
Kind of make this a fun version

732
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:50,624
But you know what I think though if you ask him now point-blank like

733
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,488
Amanda black

734
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,560
I'm not doing any

735
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,120
You better go right

736
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
I think is probably where this interview is

737
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Is the most irresponsible

738
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
Not in terms of like the content

739
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
Murder victim

740
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
Richard Baldwin was a child

741
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,760
Without any evidence

742
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Deeply response

743
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Baofeng

744
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,856
I'll bet you could do if you're covering this story

745
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Interviewer standpoint

746
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
This is where it's at

747
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Tryon

748
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
He went to Vietnam

749
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
As a lieutenant in the army

750
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
Before that

751
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
She went

752
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,448
Sheila an Interstellar treaty,

753
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
But we can come back to that

754
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
So he was doing

755
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Early on

756
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
He wanted to the Vietnam as a lieutenant

757
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,688
Came out a captain in the Army and then

758
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Move sideways in

759
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Michaela

760
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Captain in the Navy

761
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
So his

762
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
Current rank

763
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
Is Cap Navy captain

764
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,768
So here's the thing through some problems with the story

765
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,376
Jump rope Navy and State

766
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Talk about

767
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:12,800
Is the problems here at the story that Joann's tell Kevin about her husband's alleged military service

768
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,080
Should be asking follow-up

769
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
Lessons about Indians

770
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
That you just took

771
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:21,760
Actively participating

772
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,064
Spread dubious bulshit on his show

773
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
He really doesn't care to push back on it at all

774
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,464
The most glaring problem

775
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,328
Became a captain in the Army moves sideways

776
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,912
Probably

777
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
Well that a lateral move

778
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
Is ranked both branch

779
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,384
Anything about the services would think going from army captain

780
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Navy captain

781
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,992
Where is a lateral move

782
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
Achieved after reaching the rank

783
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
Lieutenant

784
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
And first lieutenant

785
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
In the Navy Captain is an o-6

786
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Position after ensign

787
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
Lieutenant Junior grade

788
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Commander commander

789
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,888
Moving Sideways from the position of army Commander

790
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Lieutenant

791
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
Tomorrow

792
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Easycap

793
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
Then one would need to be promoted

794
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
Three times along the way

795
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
What is a pretty sizable job

796
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,432
The second problem is that she's just which branches of enlist

797
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,736
You could just do on a whim

798
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
Well it is possible to switch branches

799
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Not very common

800
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
The process is really pretty complicated

801
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,208
There's a saying that I ran into a few times while looking

802
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
It goes like this

803
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,560
It's easier to join the military from the streets and from the flea

804
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:44,448
Express

805
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
Would you have to consider

806
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
He's not just the Army but with boats

807
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
Branch of service

808
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Cultures differ

809
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Missions

810
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Let's go through

811
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
Someone who reaches 03 in the army

812
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,575
Likely a different set of skills

813
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,855
203 in the Navy

814
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
And there's no real

815
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
Skills

816
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
To be transferable

817
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,719
This isn't to say that it

818
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
It's never done

819
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,767
But it's pretty rare

820
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
And when it does happen

821
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,607
It never comes with an arbitrary 3-ranked promotion

822
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,447
Just so you get to keep the same literal title captain

823
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,055
We're happy to interview

824
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:26,175
We love to have you give me a list of skills

825
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,247
Okay you can run very so I talked to Raptors

826
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,783
Okay that one might help

827
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,879
The story of Joanne is telling indicates a lack of awareness

828
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
The military were

829
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
A lack of awareness

830
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,743
Captain isn't the same rank in the Army and the Navy

831
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,071
And a lack of awareness that there's literally no proof that Mark was he

832
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Never in the army

833
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Orange

834
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,727
Military records show that Marx dad Ellis Orthodox men

835
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,567
Join the Army in 9th or the Air Force in 1942

836
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,175
Military records also show that he was involved in for plane crashes during isn't list

837
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
Between 1943 and 90

838
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Teen 52

839
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,039
From the report about his night

840
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Bad pilot

841
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,303
The canopy exploded off but not by the pilot and the tail section broke off at the turbine wheel set

842
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
Very well

843
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,703
The pilot was dragged along the ground and slick

844
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
Deep Cuts in a brain concussion

845
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Also breaking his

846
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,895
This plane crash led to Ellis being leaving the service being partially paralyzed

847
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,711
Newspaper articles about Mark's arrested

848
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
Trial include quotes

849
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,295
From Alice and they all mentioned that he was disabled

850
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,879
Which makes it very unlikely that he was going on Space Battles after night

851
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Fifteen52

852
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
Or that he was fighting adults

853
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Sea bass battle

854
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Years later is Marcus dead

855
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,839
Elvis died before Joanne ever met mark

856
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
So all she really knows about him

857
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Does what he's told

858
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,263
So she can believe all this b*******

859
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Battles of aliens

860
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
It was

861
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Personally

862
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
Right

863
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,735
Like remember when Willie Walker

864
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
Walking on a

865
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,111
And then that's not

866
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,647
Dallas pets

867
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,999
It's not it was in a bit

868
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Fayetteville

869
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,071
Mark is almost certainly making up his

870
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,935
He claimed to be served in Vietnam

871
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
75

872
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,543
Mark graduated from Dominican College with a history degree

873
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
He was born in 1950

874
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,199
G3722 or 23 graduating

875
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Undergraduate program

876
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Right on schedule

877
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
19 seven

878
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
33 he was arrested

879
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
Insurance fraud

880
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
The charges were eventually dropped

881
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
It's pretty strong proof that he wasn't in

882
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Vietnam

883
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,767
There's literally no proof that Mark was ever in life

884
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,839
No documentation no pictures of him in uniform

885
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
No medals are stripes

886
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:58,239
Short of some sort of a bombshell that they're just not showing anybody some reason

887
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
It's pretty easy

888
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
But this is a case of

889
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Stolen Valor

890
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
Unmarked Spark

891
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Lift out that possibility

892
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,967
The second Joanne said that Mark moves sideways

893
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
From army Captain to Navy

894
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,551
It's an absurd state

895
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,343
Kevin doesn't bat an eyelash

896
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
He doesn't have to follow up question

897
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Because he's an active

898
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
Participate

899
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,231
In platforming this b*******

900
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Welding

901
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,839
Established that he was in fact about the captain in the army

902
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
Maybe we can just move on right

903
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
Please give a summary of the rest

904
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,007
Whatever

905
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Participant

906
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,223
Reinforces that as

907
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
He tells people to go listen

908
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
Two other interviews Market

909
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,415
And even like you're a child and she's been there twice now and just is

910
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
Anybody

911
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
To visit him

912
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,999
I don't want to stay at

913
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,791
I try not to put them on a pedestal

914
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,631
But you're just in all of the wealth of information that he

915
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
Tino's

916
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
Yeah

917
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Gregory

918
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
Soho react

919
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,527
Wait he saw her

920
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
Very Berry in

921
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
First time John listed

922
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
To meet him as well

923
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:27,583
Listen to

924
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
Who carries interviews with Mark Richards

925
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:34,239
There's video outside

926
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,031
Vacaville the first time

927
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
Zecharia Joanne

928
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,663
She thought that you'd be able to video record stuff store

929
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Who's videotape

930
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,479
Yourself in the car

931
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,367
Turn off camera and then turn it back on whenever they got

932
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,743
So he knows the kind of bulshit that's in them

933
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
If you're not

934
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
After 3

935
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Interested in trying to

936
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,863
Get a piece of it or something

937
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,471
Send

938
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Schoolboy what's going on

939
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
There's something

940
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,895
Though there is something

941
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,223
So I don't know if you remember earlier

942
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,111
Interstellar comp

943
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,439
And what that was all about

944
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
Braces right

945
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,279
They're coming here they're going to decide whether we get to go to space

946
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,839
They're going to decide

947
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Taking our jobs

948
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,471
Experimentation

949
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
I'm too or something

950
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,847
Prince of the UK leave some alien children

951
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
That it could have gone in

952
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,807
It was fascinating so Mark is there

953
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
And

954
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
Teenage father in 1950

955
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,695
To Matt a Raptor

956
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,791
Which is a reptilian that was originated here on Earth

957
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:06,143
Dallas was in that terrible paralyzing

958
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
Plane crash

959
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
Mark might be trying

960
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
To recapture

961
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
It looks like

962
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Evan Healy vault

963
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,223
Dinosaurs

964
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,247
Tall guy

965
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,575
With a long tail and long snout Lots

966
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
So big

967
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,647
Sharp teeth and very sharp claws

968
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,743
And they became friends of 1952 when Prince Naga

969
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
Came as an ambassador

970
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,887
Forgiving forward almost 10 years and Naga is at this conference

971
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,215
Checks out two of his children princess Linka and

972
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Crack

973
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,799
Are we still doing the markets to me

974
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Gets to me the Raptor

975
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
First of the first

976
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Time

977
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:48,895
They thought it was

978
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
And he becomes

979
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:58,111
Really good friends with Princess Linka and Prince Cragin they were several years older he was sick

980
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,903
707 going on 8th

981
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
Summer

982
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
And they were probably

983
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,255
You know there were several years older

984
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
They just became great friends and marks

985
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,887
English friend

986
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,679
Titania was with him

987
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:16,031
Average humans that were there decided they wanted to have this little experiment in

988
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,615
She will Howard the human shoulder going to react and get along with the alien

989
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Children

990
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
Fortunately that the Raptors didn't

991
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:28,575
Eat them so that was cool that is a real cool thing that happened

992
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,975
Eat the children

993
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,791
You win some you lose some

994
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,495
She's just she's just rolling over that with her

995
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,823
I was watching your reaction so you got real f****** like

996
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
Shrugging

997
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Talk about

998
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
When she said there a couple years old in human years

999
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,903
I'm glad you clarified because I was going to ask my

1000
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,487
Different planet to work

1001
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:15,679
Earth rotation around the

1002
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,983
Hayward

1003
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
And probably

1004
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
I I think my

1005
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,759
Favorite subject

1006
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Here is

1007
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
Do you think Mark is real mad

1008
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
People know him

1009
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
Name is Mark

1010
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:43,839
Because it look at the names of my playlist

1011
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:49,727
Mark the whole time is like

1012
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:56,383
And as we know one of the main characters from his book

1013
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,295
Super important to recognize here is that

1014
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
He doesn't ask

1015
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,623
Any f****** follow-ups after that nonsense

1016
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,159
The ID

1017
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,207
When is

1018
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,999
Presenting

1019
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,047
Did Mark as a child

1020
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
To a conference

1021
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
The UK

1022
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,191
Where he made friends with raptor babies who might have eaten him

1023
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:25,823
Because his friends with rafter royalty few years prior

1024
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
It was like

1025
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Okay

1026
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,271
It's not a it's not a good energy all right what was the conference

1027
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
No she doesn't

1028
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,183
Like whether or not humans could go to space

1029
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,743
Brenda universe

1030
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,791
So I don't understand

1031
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
If that is what the conference

1032
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,655
Is why there's the possibility of being

1033
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Eaten by Raptors

1034
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,703
There's always

1035
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,919
Conference on

1036
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:06,271
There shouldn't be a chance

1037
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Because it's

1038
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
There's no Raptors

1039
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
F******

1040
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,719
Every time there's a security council meeting

1041
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:19,583
You wouldn't want to take that appointment

1042
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
The appointment

1043
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
We're going to have some breakout sessions right now Terrence

1044
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:33,151
You're going to be with the roofers today is almost a princess Linka

1045
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
Cool

1046
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
Cool

1047
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,807
So we learned Raptors

1048
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
We already know that

1049
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:45,439
But at this point to a couple of the other races

1050
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
And here

1051
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:55,935
Excited to learn about the cat

1052
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,495
There's a cat species

1053
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:02,335
And they're basically scientists and artists and archaeologist

1054
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,919
You know about the one he talks about the most she's at Contessa

1055
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:10,015
She comes here to the planet

1056
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,319
Because she's trying to discover evidence of

1057
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,647
When and where her species has been when they visited her

1058
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,231
I hear that

1059
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,535
Right

1060
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,239
First of all feline Contessa might be a new rank

1061
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:34,591
Feline

1062
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,687
The others

1063
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,735
I hear that

1064
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
I can't not hear it is Mark

1065
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,319
About litter boxes

1066
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
The cats like to dig

1067
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,391
So they're archaeology

1068
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:54,047
I heard as his veiled

1069
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
Sexism

1070
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,119
That is because those are the jobs

1071
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
Considers to be more feminine

1072
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
Maybe

1073
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,287
It's possible Association of cats

1074
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:09,407
Sweat Franklin

1075
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,599
I'd like to go on a date with him sometime I was there for one semester in college I thought I was going to be

1076
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,927
Archaeology

1077
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,999
Find out about dog

1078
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,119
Is old on

1079
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:38,335
So is every other alien species of a feudal

1080
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Structure

1081
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:44,735
Like she's a Contessa like there's no it's hard to say

1082
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:50,367
I think it's because Mark likes that kind of fiction

1083
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:57,023
Ethereal Legends stuff like that

1084
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,839
Dude dollars get into dogs

1085
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:05,215
I do not like dogs rather be around cats and dogs

1086
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,031
There's just something I don't trust about

1087
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
To say

1088
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,407
You were right b a

1089
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,991
There's a dog species that has a huge base here

1090
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,039
Prepare basic their hole

1091
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,135
Existence at me no Merchants there businessman they love

1092
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,671
To work with humans just

1093
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,975
As a matter of you not being capitalistic

1094
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:31,327
Dog aliens are capitalist

1095
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:35,679
Interstellar Merchant

1096
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:46,431
Of course I should have seen that one coming

1097
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,967
They still love to be around

1098
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
That is true across

1099
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
All aspects

1100
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Steven Universe

1101
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,135
I'd love to be around people

1102
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
Right but it's all because of capital is

1103
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Dogs.

1104
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:13,567
Do we are we going to get some Mos Def and Talib Kweli from the buyer

1105
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
And their intellectual

1106
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
And great

1107
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
And I love that

1108
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,039
And they're always looking for a buck

1109
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
Traders traveling cups

1110
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Systems

1111
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,927
System selling their Wares nonsense

1112
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
So innocent Joanne

1113
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,071
Elvis selling VA.

1114
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
Pretty much all natural disasters

1115
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,191
Or just cover-ups

1116
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
For math

1117
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,495
Abduction

1118
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,543
Kevin response

1119
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,847
Absurd notion

1120
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Being said to his f******

1121
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Face

1122
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,759
And so a lot of times and natural disasters will happen

1123
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,599
Because there is either about to be or there's just been a major calling

1124
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,695
Humans and they just took kidnapped thousands of people and

1125
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,791
Very negative reason

1126
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,839
It's usually not because

1127
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:14,751
They want you to be their best friend and go to school with your kids

1128
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
Fight about it Miss if people

1129
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,567
Talk about love

1130
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,847
It's not

1131
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,663
It's not positive

1132
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Well

1133
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,991
Whoa

1134
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,111
You think this price of

1135
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
Evidence

1136
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Where they've gone

1137
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,439
Who's took right

1138
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
Who's

1139
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999

1140
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Oh boy

1141
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,559
So she went

1142
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
Recover from

1143
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,335
All of those just disappear I get it I get it

1144
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,639
We're at we're all talk about the Malaysian plane

1145
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
It's 2050

1146
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
I got you

1147
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
But come on

1148
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
It's not like there's a ton of playing

1149
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:01,087
That's not what

1150
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,927
Yeah I mean interpretation

1151
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Bad the fact

1152
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
City doesn't push back in

1153
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:12,351
Anyways

1154
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
Is really bad

1155
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
Also

1156
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,959
Forced busing

1157
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,495
I think that might be part of it

1158
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,799
Could be you know what else

1159
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:27,711
Terrorism

1160
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:33,087
And they also work with that terrorist groups

1161
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Which one

1162
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,671
So for example when you hear of a terrorist

1163
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,999
DVD maybe at a shopping mall

1164
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,047
Or maybe in a middle eastern

1165
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
Country for example

1166
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
It's not always

1167
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,935
50 human terrorists that are at fault they're awful

1168
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
Send working with

1169
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
Alien

1170
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,287
Terror

1171
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
Bad guy

1172
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,639
Call them terrorists

1173
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
Yes

1174
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:12,511
Nearby

1175
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
Talked about the

1176
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
I want

1177
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583

Got to come back on and then listen to the plug

1180
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,151
We haven't covered

1181

Soap

1182
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
Again I would I would recommend

1183
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
Emma put links on there

1184
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Carrie cast

1185

You just woke up

1186
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
If she goes a lot morning

1187
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Depth

Go on my website

1189
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,727

1190
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
Hcad.org

Headquarters

1192
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,615
If you go on my website and click on product

I have descriptions of all the different reports that I sell

1194
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,783
That he's written about his different missions and Adventures in

1195
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,319
I'm going to sound like

1196
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,855
But their true military mission

1197
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,671
Planet summer off-planet so

1198
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Whatever you want

1199
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
You can get

1200
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
Has been

1201
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,143
The old way through

1202
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
It's the least you

1203
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,871
Wow you obsequious prick

1204
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
This install that we really need to listen

1205
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
Interview with that

1206
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
Just playing the entire thing

1207
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:44,671
Kevin Moore does literally push back against any of the things

1208
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,439
Joanne rich

1209
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,207
Pictures of telling him

1210
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
He believes

1211
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:51,327
He doubled narratives and is not in anyway exercise

1212
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,631
We're looking for evidence for any

1213
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,239
He even establishes that Mark was away on a mission with Richard Baldwin's murder

1214
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,079
As an answer to an open question

1215
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,615
Kevin established

1216
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
For her

1217
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,175
Something like that makes Kevin

1218
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
Claims of carrots

1219
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,039
About how Baldwin

1220
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
Seems very

1221
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
F****** Halo

1222
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,671
I want you so I just

1223
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
Here's the thing

1224
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,511
The burright look at Kevin Moore's videos

1225
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
About his documentary

1226
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,423
You look at the past

1227
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
You look at this stuff the fact that

1228
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:34,591
Use actively engaged in spreading these stories

1229
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
A little bit rough

1230
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,479
Disclosures

1231
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,759
While he's talking about

1232
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
This documentary

1233
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
I used to believe it I haven't heard a word of that video

1234
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,767
But he has far too many for me to watch all of them

1235
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
Okay

1236
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
So

1237
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:01,471
How are we

1238
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Before we get to that

1239
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
He's an a******

1240
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
One of the reasons

1241
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,407
Clip

1242
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,271
Free seems to be saying that part of his

1243
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
He's doing interview for this documentary

1244
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,903
Is digging into the validity of Mark and Joanne

1245
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
Marriage

1246
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:27,839

1247
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,103
Contact

1248
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,151
Montgomery Clerk's Office

1249
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:47,807
End the marriage certificate

1250
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
Documentary

1251
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,599
Jo-Ann's

1252
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:55,999
Mariemont

1253
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:15,199
I will make my own checks as well cuz I'm going to go down to Alameda where you hide your previous marriage

1254
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:20,319
I'm divorced should be there as well

1255
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,623
My riches coming soon

1256
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,719
40 amazing secrets

1257
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Mock

1258
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
Riches

1259
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:36,191
Unless unless she's like

1260
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:42,591
Con woman with multiple documentaries about something else

1261
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,663
It's not about Mark Richards in his murder that

1262
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:50,015
But one thing to remember is that Joanne by her own admission

1263
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Has

1264
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
Married and divorce

1265
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
Several times

1266
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Because she

1267
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,671
Pretty awful marriages

1268
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,719
Getting married and divorced freaky

1269
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,023
Play can lead to some nominal confusion

1270
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,815
Especially to external Observers

1271
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,631
It seems like Heaven's trying to take that and make it

1272
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
Suspicious

1273
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,727
Vindictive

1274
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,567
Their marriage has nothing to do with this documentary as it's being presented

1275
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,175
Whatever

1276
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,967
Expose your wedding certificate

1277
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,807
Although it doesn't strengthen his argument that Mark is lying about the murder

1278
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,855
It's just an attempt to hurt Joanne

1279
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,183
Yeah

1280
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,719
I suppose the only

1281
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,767
Only way that that is not

1282
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
Complete and total dick

1283
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,375
Move is if she is like a noted Conway

1284
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,423
Traveled around

1285
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
Right

1286
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,847
She's not funny but I will look

1287
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,151
The TV where owns Volvo

1288
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Beyonce

1289
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,455
Some subconscious level but it's not

1290
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,783
That's not essential piece of what

1291
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,343
The birth name

1292
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Is 1

1293
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,159
And then the other name did he uses

1294
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
Faucet

1295
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
And if you look in the like

1296
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,791
You can find her going by that name

1297
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,559
Probably

1298
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
Previous marriage

1299
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,887
Her husband's surname

1300
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:14,239
1997 you can find records of her online going as

1301
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,311
Is Joanne faucet and then she gets married

1302
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
Has Joanne Faust

1303
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Richard

1304
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,967
So it's there's nothing suspicious here as far as I can tell supper

1305
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,015
For him to justify this not as B

1306
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Like him just

1307
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Being a f***

1308
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Is real high

1309
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,927
Yeah he needs to establish something other than

1310
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
Winking

1311
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:36,511
Bugging us about I'm looking into you

1312
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
Gross

1313
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,351
The reason

1314
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,631
Suspicious

1315
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,471
What are those has to do with the

1316
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,007
The fact that in May 28th

1317
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
Moorhead

1318
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,919
His interview with Joanne Richardson from 2015

1319
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,711
So I suppose he could make the argument

1320
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
In the intervening

1321
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,783
Change of heart about

1322
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,551
Matter

1323
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,135
He's now working to right those wrongs like you suggested earlier

1324
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,719
Interview with Carrie took place less than a year ago

1325
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,511
If you pay attention

1326
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
You start to see shades of

1327
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
Deception

1328
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:15,935
This interview happened before he started working on his documentary about Mark Richard

1329
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:20,031
But he uses footage from this interview for the documentary

1330
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
This footage is enter

1331
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,151
Now Jordan I'd like you to take a listen

1332
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
To this

1333
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
From the trailer

1334
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,527
And he's in constant contact with the raft

1335
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:33,087
And they are now working according to him

1336
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
With our military

1337
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,951
Will Sandlot riches didn't commit a crime there cuz it's

1338
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,975
Well okay

1339
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
Absolutely friend

1340
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,887
With the comes to Mark Richards in particular

1341
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:50,239
There can be no doubt that Kerry Cassidy has no objectivity

1342
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:55,359
She's personally involved and invested in this story like no other

1343
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
So what you're telling me

1344
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,455
Music I like

1345
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,015
Alright from how the clip

1346
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,087
Kerry was used in the trailer you get the sense that Kevin was

1347
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,415
Confronted her about how Marc was actually guilty of the murder

1348
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,951
Pitchy foolishly insist

1349
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
But he was Frank

1350
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,559
What's the clip that plays right after is meant to drive home that

1351
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Intended message

1352
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
Now

1353
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
Let's listen to

1354
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,751
Of the actual interview

1355
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,287
From May 2018

1356
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,127
In the case of Mark Richards he's constantly talking about the rap

1357
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
After being

1358
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:32,991
The Raptors having gone through a certain amount of evolution

1359
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,575
Since the time of the dinosaurs broke off from that

1360
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,415
Actually left this part of the Galaxy

1361
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
And I all of this is in the market

1362
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
Interviews

1363
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:48,095
I would apologize in advance

1364
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
Just a few of the sink

1365
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,703
And he's in constant contact with the Raptor

1366
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,239
And they are now working

1367
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,263
According to him

1368
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,543
With our military

1369
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,567
And

1370
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,895
Protecting human

1371
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,247
Whatever you want to call

1372
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
Downloading

1373
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,111
Look humans can go through portals

1374
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:15,743
Right here we could commit a crime hat

1375
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
Okay

1376
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,559
Absolutely

1377
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
I had someone email me

1378
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
His wife wanted

1379
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
You don't know one thing

1380
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,127
I was in that time when those motives 2

1381
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
To play

1382
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
This guy is guilty of

1383
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,343
I didn't reply to him cuz I know he's guilty

1384
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:53,887
Taking over exactly exactly

1385
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:00,543
And again to be a lightworker that they've taken over and is now working for the Dark Side of Me chords are so prevalent

1386
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
You can think what you want obviously I'm not nice.

1387
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:14,367
H & H

1388
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,159
Wish I could get him on camera

1389
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,463
For the prison won't allow it

1390
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
You got to ask yourself

1391
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:23,071
This man is is been in prison well over 30 years

1392
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,119
He's he's

1393
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,167
Guinness 60s his failing health

1394
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
What you know he's

1395
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
She didn't commit the murder she supposedly

1396
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,871
Mastermind

1397
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,407
Why is there non-parole

1398
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,711
At this point in his in his life

1399
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:46,367
Well I would say poodle

1400
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
And the prison itself he was

1401
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,743
Basically treated as a Navy captain that he he

1402
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:58,143
He is and was trying to be in prison now

1403
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:03,519
About now that's why I was

1404
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,079
All you need is

1405
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:12,479
You know tomorrow someone will come along with Kerry Cassidy

1406
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,759
Jubilee

1407
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:19,647
I've known her since they can lie through their teeth

1408
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:26,047
If you do it means nothing

1409
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,839
What do you want to do

1410
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,911
Discernment this is the

1411
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
Sort of land we live in

1412
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
And I stayed a people

1413
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
Do you expect truth

1414
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,823
To be delivered on a silver platter

1415
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,359
If that was the case

1416
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,639
What would be the point

1417
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
Some people do

1418
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,759
So I think you can get a very clear sense

1419
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
Exchange

1420
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:51,647
Disney accurately represent

1421
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
That's bullsh

1422
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
So

1423
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:59,839
The Oaks from less than a year ago has that

1424
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,119
Is because

1425
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,167
He did when he talked to all of these

1426
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:09,823
He was a softball interview.

1427
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
Hip2Save is Jordan

1428
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,879
And you know me I don't ever want to be coming to Kerry Cassidy

1429
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:27,743
Defense from everything I've been able to tell I really think Kevin Moore is doing our girls

1430
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,791
But I think he's doing

1431
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
Nothing about what he's doing

1432
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,447
There's even something about the whole thing that feels vindictive and

1433
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,215
Dishonest

1434
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
In some way

1435
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,775
Something must have happened

1436
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,055
Between May 28th

1437
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,359
The present-day Kevin Moore on this

1438
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,127
Trajectory

1439
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,455
But I can't pretend that I have any idea what that thing would have

1440
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,039
Beat your life no idea

1441
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
Well she wasn't

1442
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
Could be

1443
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,927
These people

1444
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:03,327
Shame because I wholeheartedly agree

1445
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,119
Masquerade

1446
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,191
The story is perfect for a farcical documentary

1447
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
So long as the subject matter is

1448
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
Treated with the

1449
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,519
Respect the victim

1450
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
Loved ones

1451
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:18,687
Desert of course $300,000

1452
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,575
It doesn't feel like a farcical documentary that

1453
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
Interested in the subject

1454
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Mattered

1455
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,767
So he's gloating in these logs about digging into their

1456
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
Personal lives

1457
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
Gross

1458
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
The part of that feeling I have

1459
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,191
Information

1460
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:48,383
Remember how I told you I thought you were going to continue

1461
01:12:54,783 --> 01:13:00,159
2011

1462
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,743
I told you that it 2011

1463
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
Kevin Post

1464
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,791
His first YouTube video

1465
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,071
The trailer for his

1466
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,351
TV show The Maury Show

1467
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
I kind of forgot

1468
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
To tell you that in the disc

1469
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,471
Scription of that video Kevin also announces that

1470
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Quote

1471
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,823

01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,871
Support the Maury Show and get a reading

1473
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
Money

1474
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,271
Going on for at least

1475
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,831
So he is a psychic

1476
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,647
Running a psychic hotline

1477
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,815
Running a hotline psychic

1478
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,887
Now he was just the Mastermind

1479
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,703
Kevin provides a link to book in for a reading

1480
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,287
On PMS psychics.com

1481
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,567
Witching hour

1482
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,103
To channel.com

1483
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,271
Delivered

1484
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,063
Mediums working

1485
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:00,831
For Kevin Moore

1486
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,879
Or at least I assume they're working

1487
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:08,767
Considering the Kevin's face is the logo for the website

1488
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:18,239
They refer to him as quote the owner so looks like it's his

1489
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:22,847
Chairman

1490
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:33,087
No employees offer silver level readings for $100 an hour

1491
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:39,487
$100 an hour but Arthur's silver level

1492
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:44,351
It's 129

1493
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,471
255

1494
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,847
Vicious

1495
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,199
And if your hours about up in the more important information for you

1496
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,223
Don't worry

1497
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,271
You're not going to get charged for an extra hour

1498
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,343
Platinum reading reading you are going to have to paste

1499
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,111
$6

1500
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
Let's see how much

1501
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:17,887
How much would a 30-minute for the other lights.

1502
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,983
It would be an extra $240

1503
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:30,687
Rite Aid for Silver and Gold

1504
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,759
Under $60

1505
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,063
More than if you just bought another hour

1506
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:42,975
Lying if I said this

1507
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:48,607
It seemed like one of the biggest scam operations I've stumbled into accidentally over the course of doing the show

1508
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:51,935
Say what you want about Kerry Cassidy

1509
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:56,031
At least she doesn't have the temerity to associate yourself with something

1510
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,615
This overtly predatory

As your face can't be read during phone call

Jordan

01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,559
They could be even more psychic on the phone

01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:58,495
Love that spin

1531
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:03,871
I decided to dig around a little and see who some of these mediums are the Kevin wasn't playing

1532
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
Others at least 30

1533
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,735
36 mediums that Kevin

1534
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,015
Since to work for him

1535
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,319
On the phone which alone seems like a

1536
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,671
Sounds probably more like

1537
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,463
45

1538
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,743
But I don't know

1539
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,167
Use their bios

1540
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
David

1541
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,471
Just just

1542
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,007
David channels

1543
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:37,407
Mostly female

1544

Empire

1546
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,119
I maybe put my favorite part of that

1547
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:04,799
Is only quotes

1548
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
Empire

1549
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,359
You can trust Cal ask

1550
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:11,199
Because he's not fully Affiliated to the baconian Empire

1551
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:17,599
You just Associated enough to know what's going on now I'm more angry

1552
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:23,999
Is he playing both sides

1553
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,071
Enough

1554
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:33,727
There's Earth Angel by the Penguins

1555
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,007
It was featured in Back to the

1556
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,543
She was

1557
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:43,967
David fields

1558
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,551
Biblical names

1559
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,951
I guess grounded

1560
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,255
You know this stuff is true

1561
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
Cuz he's just

1562
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
We really just learned that quote

1563
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,423
Her test reading blew us away

1564
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,215
Which inspires

1565
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:14,943
All right there's also woman named Galaxy who can quote

1566
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
Which I think is

1567
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:21,599
If you need that store

1568
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
And she's like

1569
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,535
You don't really

1570
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,095
I know that because I can't do it

1571
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:39,007
If I took phrasing extract

1572
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,823
Who claims that she could Channel.

1573
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:48,223
Literally the others

1574
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
Vials are pretty boring

1575
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:54,879
Unfortunately

1576
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:58,975
Also it's just kind of hard to talk to top of guy who specializes in

1577
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,255
The goddamn Thundercat

1578
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:07,423
Yeah but you are archaeologists and Poets anyways what do you really want to do with that

1579
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
.

1580
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,983
Some of them offer psychic readings

1581
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,799
Specializing giving love advice a reading tarot cards

1582
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,360
Some even claimed that they can use Reiki energy

1583
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,176
You over the phone since it's all energy

1584
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,480
Distance

1585
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,272
So what's the deal

1586
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
Here's the thing

1587
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:31,744

1596
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:49,152

1603
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,648
Very shady

1604
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,416
Yeah

1605
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,208
Very upsetting

1606
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,256
So what you're saying is that

1607
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,048
Carrie needs to

1608
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,608
To do a counter documentary about how to shave

1609
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:14,240
FML cannibalized we are right now

1610
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,104
But we don't have the great music by the great strings

1611
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,688
Yeah it's true we could use

1612
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,600
Kevin Morris operating Miss Cleo style psychic hotline

1613
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:32,928
80 possibly stealthily using his radio show to promote

1614
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,952
People who offer services

1615
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
Transfer money on it

1616
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,792
Right foot at least he's not running around acting like

1617
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,840
He can contact otherworldly entity

1618
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:40,864
I'm self

1619
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,656

I care so much about me

1623
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
The integrity

1624
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
Who's serious-minded evidence

1625
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,128
Bass researchers in the

1626
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,176
Community

1627
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:02,368
To be the bearer of obvious news

1628
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
Cool group notice the one

1629
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,816

No no I don't care what are you asking me

1633
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,712
I watched a number of these Channel

1634
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:33,856
And all he's doing is talking with his little bit and appearing slightly

1635
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:40,768
It has the feeling of you know how you like if you watch her band the lead guitarist make that pain look while the top solo

1636
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,328
He looks a lot like that

1637
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,912
In the first channeling session release the entities that were speaking

1638
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,728
Particularly interested in

1639
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,264
Kind of bragging about Kevin

1640
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Straddling

1641
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:55,616

He doesn't need to

1659
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,992
To change his voice

1660
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:37,088
Different way

1661
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,144
Is him saying I can't do characters

1662
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:54,496
Bailey's l.ron Hubbard

This is an agreement we have with him

1667
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,840
On a deeper level

1668
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,984
At a time

1669
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
Beyond

Quickest there Kevin

1677
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,864
Something pretty weird about these sorts

1678
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,888
The people get into this

1679
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,704
Kind of thing they just go on and on about how bad that

1680
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:02,336
Ego is got a free yourself from that go

1681
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,640
Through them

Really seem like they just want to stroke their egos strange kind of goes on in this next clip

1683

Courageous Journey

1690
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,144
It is only to spend

1691
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,192
A few months

1692
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
For him

Fenugreek powder

1699
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,808
Out of time Beyond now

1700
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,600
When it was agreed upon

1701
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
Thought this would

1702
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,648
Come this

1703
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,952
Gift would be known

1704
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,256
He could have said no.

1705
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
To the skiff

1706
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,584
He could have walked away but

1707
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
Sure sounds like

1708
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,936
He understood are the deepest

1709
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,216
Odyssey School

1710
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,496
The importance

1711
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,520
Of the work

1712
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,568
That needs to be undertaken now

1713
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,848
At this

1714
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,872
As we said

1715
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
Special time

1716
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Planet

1717
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
Yeah

1718
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
C unit

1719
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:27,328
I really think of it as actual other entities

1720
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:31,168
He's speaking. Would not have that kind of apart

1721
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
It's Channel

1722
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,544
Interviews

1723
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,848
3 seconds

1724
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,152
Bullshitz crazy bulk

1725
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,736
The truth

1726
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Is

1727
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
Just

1728
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:47,808
Having

1729
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,856
Flatout Vols to do this

1730
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,136
Absolutely

1731
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,672
Absolutely

1732
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,696
Crazy

1733
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
Brash

1734
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,792
It's almost like to have

1735
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
A level of

1736
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:03,424
Confidence that is all

1737
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Magic

1738
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,592
I assume that he's not reading this

1739
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:16,736
Is rocking back and forth

1740
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,016
Extemporaneously

1741
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,576
Without

1742
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,368
He does smirk

1743
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:25,184
Got a couple point

1744
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,960
Well I mean it's interesting things to that like a channel and kind of his

1745
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
The built-in

1746
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:42,080
Self-defense

1747
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,920
Genius

1748
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,712
Map to save the world

1749
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,784
Did I just do that

1750
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,576
In the middle of it

1751
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,440
But there's the built

1752
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,000
Disrupt the Stream

1753
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,888
There's all these little things that are built in order to like

1754
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:09,472
Defend yourself from it ever really being verified

1755
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,008
All this s***

1756
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,568
Interesting is that this is one of those situations where

1757
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,992
Is almost like

1758
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,040
It helps

1759
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,624
Trying really hard

1760
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,160
If you want it

1761
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,464
Go wash them

1762
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,024
They're crazy

1763
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,072
So you might notice

1764
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:39,424
You've known about these gifts perfume

1765
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,960
Obviously

1766
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
What he was

1767
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,032
A few months ago

1768
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:48,896
What make you think about that a couple months ago

1769
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,456
It's possibly unrelated but

1770
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,992
In August 24th

1771
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,320
5 months before this

1772
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:59,392
Kevin started to make a ton of videos about Edgar Cayce

1773
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,976
From August to the end of that year 19th

1774
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,536
31 videos he posted on his YouTube channel

1775
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,560
Knox

1776
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
2014

1777
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,144
We're about Edgar Cayce

1778
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:11,680
Put some

1779
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,728
His existed

1780
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,032
Regularly posting videos about New Age

1781
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
Spiritualist

1782
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,640
And yet released exactly

1783
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,688
0 videos about Edgar Cayce

1784
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,712
Until then

1785
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
Clearly the topic was a bit of a new obsession

1786
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
And for him

1787
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,600
Edgar Cayce is a guy was largely

1788
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,648
Considered to be one of the founders of the new age

1789
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:38,560
He was a real weirdo from the early 1900's who would Channel higher-level entities while he was pretending to be asleep

1790
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:41,888
They pretend not to have any idea what he said once he woke up

1791
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,704
Important is clear everyone started writing down every

1792
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
He said while he was pretending

1793
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Be asleep as become

1794
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,336
He's called The Sleeping Prophet

1795
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,664
I will get to it

1796
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,456
We could spend all day

1797
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,296
We could spend all day going over Casey's nonsense

1798
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,368
Complete bulshit prophecy

1799
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,928
But he made that you give you aside like

1800
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:08,000
He claimed it Atlantis has been destroyed by a death ray

1801
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,120
The US would ReDiscover that death rate

1802
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:16,448
He also prophesied that Atlantis would rise from the ocean

1803
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,728
68 or 19

1804
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
69

1805
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,776
YouTube

1806
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:25,408
The California would fall into the ocean sometime in the 1960s

1807
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,688
That didn't didn't

1808
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,992
Escape from l.a. I remember

1809
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,368
You famously predicted that 1933 would quote

1810
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,184
Be a good here

1811
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,584
19:33 is largely remembered as the year that Hitler became 10

1812
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,984
And Nazism started to go while there's also

1813
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,312
Year of the Great Depression with unemployment

1814
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:59,712
Most metrics definition of NADA Goodyear

1815
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:06,368
He prophesied literal Armageddon

1816
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,536
He predicted the Christianity would become the dominant religion in China by nineteen

1817
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:18,144
68 almost there or wrong 2011

1818
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,448
China was 2.6% Christian

1819
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,544
Percent does not exist in a good relationship

1820
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,848
Cheap with the oppressive government

1821
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:31,968
This list could go on and on and on the horrible medical advice

1822
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:36,576
But he would give out.

1823
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,112
In fairness

1824
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,160
Pretty much everybody was

1825
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,976
Totally but that's one

1826
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,304
Study people who cheat.

1827
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:55,776
Be stuck in the time frame of the understanding and conventional wisdom of whatever time. The person who's Chan

1828
01:31:56,032 --> 01:32:02,176
Materialism

1829
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:05,760
Where people are from

1830
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,528
The same

1831
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:09,600
Group or whatever at the gift

1832
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:13,440
It's almost as if

1833
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
Weird that

1834
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:18,048
In Scientology they looked a lot like

1835
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
B-52 bomber

1836
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:22,656
They should look like a B-52

1837
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,728
Schneider

1838
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:29,312
So what's important here is that in August 2014

1839
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,592
Kevin Moore started

1840
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,128
Videos about Edgar Cayce

1841
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,920
Interviewing people about him

1842
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,480
Is that a couple months later he coincidentally

1843
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
Discovered

1844
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,856
And he uses a talk to Ed

1845
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,136
Just For Humanity that only

1846
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,976
But it's not like you things are connected or

1847
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,768
Anyting that's just me

1848
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,536
Two separate things

1849
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,816
Pretending they're related

1850
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,352
I might be

1851
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:56,192
Or I might have watched a ton of his channeling videos

1852
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,728
And heard him say this

1853
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,104
Just

1854
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,128
Shooting in

1855
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:04,896
To this party

1856
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
Cool

1857
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,648
I have left on this

1858
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,672
Sonic before

1859
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
I bet I know who

1860
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,768
A long time ago

1861
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,960
I have left the foundation

1862
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,752
August planets

1863
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,032
How long to

1864
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
Time ago

1865
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,200
Some of you would have known me

1866
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:40,992
Casey

1867
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,552
Etiquette

1868
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,160
And I am one of the guys

1869
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,208
True Cafe

1870
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,560
I don't normally come through

1871
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
So this

1872
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,680
I've been there with him before his books

1873
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,752
And I also comes through

1874
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,592
I'm Different situation

1875
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:14,528
But just a pop in to say hello

1876
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,184
Just dropped in to say hello guys I'm traveling

1877
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:21,952
A basin

1878
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
This one is like

1879
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,840
This

1880
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:31,424
Kevin the f****** I don't usually do this

1881
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:39,616
So they're really credible credibility

1882
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,528
Incredibly fascinating

1883
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,088
Like this

1884
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,624
Disease with

1885
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,904
Spreads

1886
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,232
Jerusalem syndrome

1887
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,280
Some people go to Jerusalem

1888
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,072
And they end up thinking that they're G

1889
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:03,936
That's right it's just something it's a phenomenon that happens

1890
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,960
Exactly why

1891
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,520
People who get who are they kind of

1892
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,056
Unhinged

1893
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:15,456
And maybe a little bit ambitious and get a little of it called the new age

1894
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,736
A little bit

1895
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,296
It stopped and then they started

1896
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,880
You've got this Kevin Moore who's

1897
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,160
Pretending that he has

1898
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:24,928
Edgar Cayce

1899
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:28,000
He talkin through him Wilcox

1900
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
His mate

1901
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,792
Career off saying that

1902
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
He's the reincarnation

1903
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,608
Of entertainment

1904
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:34,912
It's just this

1905
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,936
Frequent Worthy's

1906
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,704
Con artist

1907
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,472
Use him

1908
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,264
In order to reinforce the

1909
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,336
Legitimacy

1910
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,152
It is almost like

1911
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:49,504
It is it is almost like they are being conned from Beyond

1912
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,272
The grave

1913
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,856
There is like

1914
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,928
Like metaphysical thing going on here

1915
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,952
I would not

1916
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,720
Doubt

1917
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,792
That it is aggravating fuckboy

1918
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,888
Bright that goes would be conning people left

1919
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:06,912
So

1920
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,472
In the same way

1921
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,496
Flattered

1922
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,800
So maybe is

1923
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,592
AKC is f***

1924
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:17,920
That black man you're so great I love it

1925
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,712
Europe the best

1926
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,992
So good at it

1927
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,368
This dude is a great a scam

1928
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,952
His history shows a real pattern new-age beliefs

1929
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
Spiritualism as a business

1930
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Model

1931
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,792
He runs a psychic hotline

1932
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:38,656
He's tried to establish himself as a super important

1933
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,192
Coming from Edgar Cayce

1934
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:43,520
As well as other less recognizable he named entity

1935
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:47,616
When it suited his purpose he's been perfectly willing

1936
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,384
Sunquest

1937
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,664
Ginobli platform

1938
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,456
Cassidy

1939
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,272
And allowed them to spread misinformation about Mark Richard

1940
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
Even going out of his way to help them.

1941
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,368
Like from the criticism

1942
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,416
And now that's all chain

1943
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,720
Needs a heroic crusader

1944
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:08,096
Stop for fact-based investigators in the new wage world and expose Mark Joann

1945
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,632
I'm sure you can

1946
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
See how this feels like it's

1947
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
Sweet bulshit

1948
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,960
His motivation

1949
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:15,008
Can't be that he's offended by what they're saying

1950
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,312
Because he's been apart of saying literally the same

1951
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,080
Thanks

1952
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,640
He can't be interested in defending rigorously

1953
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
Play research tan

1954
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,456
In fact

1955
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,224
Communities

1956
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,760
Because Mark Richards being a c

1957
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:30,112
Has exactly as much proof attached to it as him channeling Edgar

1958
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:30,880
Perkasie

1959
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,696
Something is up here and I think I might have

1960
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,720
That we stumbled onto a

1961
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
Clue as to what it is

1962
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,560
Obviously I can't prove any

1963
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,352
But I have a bit of Suspicion

1964
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,120
Kevin Morris

1965
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,144
Who is not making

1966
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:42,912
Documentary

1967
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,448
Out of a concern for the

1968
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,984
Nor even outages

1969
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,008
Sincere desire

1970
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,080
Wheelie insane and awesome story of Margaret

1971
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:50,848
Is he

1972
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,128
Making

1973
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,664
He has

1974
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,504
As best I can

1975
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,808
I believe

1976
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,440
When Kevin interviewed rash

1977
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,720
The psychic hotline

1978
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,768
Employee who can talk to Jesus

1979
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,816
He brings up a particular Lament

1980
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,096
That I found variant

1981
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,400
I mean obviously

1982
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,448
The Haunting about this

1983
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,496
When I say hi

1984
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,336
Of myself

1985
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,920
With with

1986
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,456
Amazing guest

1987
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,480
To self coming

1988
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,528
What icon

1989
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Heart-wrenching

1990
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,184
That... The mainstream

1991
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
Shows

1992
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,000
Alright

1993
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,304
Audience driving

1994
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
An honest

1995
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
To shame because

1996
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:46,400
I think Pizza

1997
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
People already

1998
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,960
So

1999
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
Tennessee in expression

2000
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,312
Deserved

2001
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,080
3 bigger than I am

2002
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
The show

2003
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,248
I think I'm pretty great

2004
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,296
My later channeling work

2005
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,112
Kevin Morris YouTube channel his primary means of

2006
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:08,416
Distributing is material has 63,000

2007
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,184
Subscribers

2008
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,488
Is nothing to sneeze at

2009
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:20,448
Project

2010
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,824
Escribers almost four times

2011
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:26,848
Evans audience

2012
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:32,224
Get a few thousand of them like an interview about robots

2013
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,248
3 weeks ago

2014
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,272
Lisa

2015
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,552
834

2016
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,136
Is 20 / 30

2017
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,160
2000 Vue

2018
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
Well over the average on

2019
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,720
His channel

2020
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:45,024
Drives traffic

2021
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,328
Project Camelot is a larger aunt

2022
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
Get a bigger thing

2023
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:54,752
Kevin recently did an Indiegogo campaign to make a documentary about how channelers are totally real

2024
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
Which

2025
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,336
Cross purposes for someone who runs

2026
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:03,712
Psychic hotline documentary feel like it's a bit of an extended commercial but whatever

2027
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,528
In the in the time of the campaign was active

2028
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,552
Eclipse

2029
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,856
$15,000

2030
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,672
Ending up with just a little bit over 27

2031
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,440
10000.

2032
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,976
But what I find

2033
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:15,744
Suspicious

2034
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,048
Is the fist total came from only 80

2035
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:18,816
You to donors

2036
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,376
Which is an average of about 304

2037
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,728
There are red flags all over this crowdfunding

2038
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,520
The campaign but I won't bore you with the number

2039
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,568
I did some weird map

2040
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,104
Just does not make sense

2041
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,640
Is all kinds of people

2042
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,200
Claim Rewards

2043
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,992
A prizes or anything

2044
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:41,344
Leads me to believe that

2045
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,184
Yeah I'm Lois tears $25

2046
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,000
So there's probably a lot of them who were

2047
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:48,768
Baloch

2048
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:54,656
So we have probably 80 below $25.

2049
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,216
29 prizes

2050
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,496
Out of those

2051
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,264
82

2052
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,056
People that were actually claimed

2053
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,616
Shrek

2054
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,456
There's a lot of reason

2055
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Do you have

2056
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,760
Some suspicion

2057
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,040
About what's going on there

2058
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
But no matter what

2059
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,880
Even if everything is above board

2060
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:17,696
Who wanted to make his documentary

2061
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:21,280
Compare that to carries failed Indiegogo from 2015

2062
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,560
Where she was trying to raise

2063
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,888
Where's the starter Network

2064
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,680
That was shooting for the

2065
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,752
O2pur Huber

2066
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,872
She had 189 people donate over twice

2067
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,968
Also running a GoFundMe campaign

2068
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:43,296
To get a two documentaries made Mark Richards one and what about you

2069
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:47,648
He also wants to launch the international spirit

2070
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,000
Campaign on GoFundMe

2071
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,816
His only raised 527 lb

2072
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,584
From 9th

2073
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,352
Teen donors

2074
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,656
I'm not trying to

2075
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,704
Just the cabin is getting dark money

2076
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,568
I'm suggesting that it looks very possible that the donations.

2077
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
Indiegogo campaign

2078
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,360
Came from a

2079
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Sponsor

2080
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:10,176
Most likely Ozark Mountain publisher

2081
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:14,528
A new age book distributor the cabin is acknowledged as a sponsor regularly in the past

2082
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:16,064
Andrew runs ads on his show

2083
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,624
It seems entirely possible that you launched

2084
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
Crowdfunding for his documentary

2085
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,696
No one was interested

2086
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,488
His sponsor stepped in to create the

2087
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:28,864
I have a strong suspicion the Kevin Moore is not motivated by preserving

2088
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,168
Everything I've seen gives me these

2089
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:33,216
Strong indication that are much more likely

2090
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,496
Explanation for all of this

2091
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:37,056
Is the Kevin wants to take over Carrie cast

2092
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,360
The share of the new age bulshit Market

2093
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,896
Dispute

2094
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,456
Equivalent of a situation where a mobster is extort

2095
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,480
Bring the store owner

2096
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:52,160
Sure you got rid of the mobster extorting to store owner but you only did that so

2097
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,952
So you could pray on that storeowner you

2098
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,720
Yourself

2099
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
Yeah

2100
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,096
At least that's the sense I get

2101
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,376
Yeah

2102
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,704
A British guy

2103
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,520
An exorbitantly priced psychic hotline for the better part of it

2104
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:13,920
Really cares about misinformation being spread

2105
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,200
Misinformation

2106
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:20,320
Possible

2107
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,136
You just got to decide for yourself

2108
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
I am

2109
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,952
Dead center

2110
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:28,768
50 on one side 15 on the other side.

2111
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,072
I feel like

2112
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:35,936
But one of them that I come away from all this with

2113
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:36,960
Is

2114
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:37,984
Like

2115
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,264
Get the f*** out of

2116
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,056
Get the f*** out of here

2117
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,080
Wiqui

2118
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:46,688
Are the ones

2119
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:53,088
Marriage status a****** at least we're better than that

2120
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:59,488
Like to laugh at Carrie and enjoy and have fun and then whatever she says

2121
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,536
Things that are like

2122
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,376
But there's no

2123
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:08,192
This is such b******* for one reason one reason

2124
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:10,752
Very idea of what

2125
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,032
He's doing it so stupid

2126
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,056
Because

2127
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:16,896
There's no way that you're going to bake this documentary about Mark Richard

2128
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,944
Like people are black

2129
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
Oh my God

2130
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,760
Project Camelot

2131
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,040
We are going to go in

2132
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,064
Be smart now

2133
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,928
You're not going

2134
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,952
How to turn people in

2135
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,720
Into like

2136
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,512
People who actually read book

2137
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,864
Make a vacuum in their life

2138
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,192
Whatever Guru vacuum is there a yeah

2139
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:44,032
Did enough of them will come over to you it'll fill that Gap

2140
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,824
Bummer

2141
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,616
Fascinated by like

2142
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,944
You know it's just bringing those channeling videos

2143
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,224
Into my life

2144
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:57,344
Thank you I mean if you don't look into any of this stuff that I like I didn't

2145
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,696
Initially you just be this documentary for this trailer for The

2146
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:06,816
Phuc yea

2147
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,656
You run the very serious risk of endorse

2148
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:16,032
Someone because you like the idea of this documentary instead of looking at like

2149
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,312
What's going on here

2150
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:19,104
Been realizing you runs a psycho

2151
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,640
Hotline

2152
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,408
Channel Lent

2153
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,176
Kathy's

2154
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,224
He's just as bad if not worse

2155
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,624
I think he's absolutely worse than carry at least for that bike channelling hotline

2156
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,904
$1 an hour

2157
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,672
Minimum

2158
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,464
Hotline

2159
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,744
He's crazy

2160
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:36,768
Like that

2161
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,560
That to me is is funneling

2162
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,584
Your audience

2163
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:40,864
Towards something

2164
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
So much more destructive

2165
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:45,984
Then just a stupid idea that carry

2166
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,800
Evan maybe her hilarious album

2167
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,152
He can't possibly make that much

2168
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,712
I assume

2169
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
Knox

2170
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,016
Possibly make that

2171
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,808
I don't know but

2172
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,344
It doesn't matter to me

2173
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,624
If if

2174
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,744
He doesn't make a lot of money off it's not for lack of trying and it's not anything

2175
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,304
She's not doing what you doing

2176
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,328
Exact

2177
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,424
To be a big pile of s*** making a

2178
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,728
Defrauding people with psychic

2179
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,080
Small business owners life

2180
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:26,176
Your do it right now he's an entrepreneur

2181
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:31,296
He's trying to build something from the ground up

2182
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,856
I mean

2183
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:36,672
Your mouth but

2184
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:40,000
What's a cardigan

2185
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
Yeah course

2186
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,048
I mean come on

2187
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,840
Just anybody

2188
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,656
God those channeling videos

2189
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:52,544
I don't I wouldn't have wanted to place so long

2190
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,568
I swear

2191
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,592
Even if

2192
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,872
Was proven

2193
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,408
Factually correct

2194
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,944
That he was Channel

2195
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,992
I'd still be out on that

2196
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,784
F*** that

2197
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,344
Videos

2198
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,392
Justin

2199
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
Channeling

2200
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
Do you

2201
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,512
Feel similarly weirdly defensive

2202
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:15,840
About

2203
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,632
Carrie was real mad

2204
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,704
In that clip of the interview that you played with

2205
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240
Her and him whenever

2206
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,264
Just brought up

2207
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,288
The fact that

2208
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,592
Mark Richards murder somebody

2209
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:30,944
And she's just cut about a map

2210
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:37,856
She's our friend

2211
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,696
This is the difference

2212
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:49,120
Listening 2 hours upon hours upon hours of

2213
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:57,824
And then me just hearing what you showing I don't develop the same emotional

2214
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,128
Okay that's fine and I don't actually have that much

2215
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:07,296
I know your feelings

2216
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:10,368
But I do feel protective

2217
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:13,696
A little bit

2218
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,744
Much more

2219
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
Craft

2220
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:18,304
Kevin

2221
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:21,376
Much more malice

2222
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,680
On his part

2223
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,960
Like what

2224
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,984
To do with this

2225
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,520
Stuff

2226
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,056
Doesn't strike me as

2227
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:29,824
Positive

2228
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:34,688
And he also seems like he's probably a lot more enterprising and a lot more

2229
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,224
Yeah he is

2230
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:36,992
Probably

2231
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,528
Got into the Heights

2232
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
Ever get to

2233
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,832
She made a

2234
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,112
Like a pilot for a

2235
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:46,720
2 videos

2236
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,512
Everything glitches all the time

2237
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:54,912
The dogs bark in the background as much as I do

2238
01:48:55,168 --> 01:49:01,056
You're worried about it

2239
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:04,640
I don't necessarily even think that it's innocent don't put that word in my

2240
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
Impotent

2241
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,712
If you act like it's

2242
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:11,808
Fiction spiral out of control that much further

2243
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,112
I do think he

2244
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
He could I think he

2245
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,416
He could

2246
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,464
Videos out of

2247
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,232
Purcell f******

2248
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,816
Stuff like that

2249
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:28,448
Presumptuous on the other mobile

2250
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
Someone who

2251
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,288
Like put multiple videos

2252
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,568
Themselves

2253
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,128
I don't know

2254
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,152
What you're capable of

2255
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
Right

2256
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,456
The other hand

2257
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,808
He seems most likely to overreach and then

2258
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:49,952
Project Camelot

2259
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:53,536
Not going to dental caries mounting a defense

2260
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:56,096
You know I don't think no matter what

2261
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,376
That's the other thing

2262
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:59,936
Yeah that's the other thing about why this is f****** stupid

2263
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:02,496
If you intend to show

2264
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:07,104
Misinformation parts of the

2265
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,896
Space Community or whatever

2266
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,432
What the f*** are you doing this

2267
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:17,088
Quite honestly you're going to make this documentary as everyone is going to be operative

2268
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:21,952
Defenses again

2269
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:26,816
Kind of truth-telling

2270
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:28,096
The end result

2271
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,960
That that being presented as his motive

2272
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:33,728
For this

2273
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,752
Little suspicious

2274
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:36,032
Yeah especially since

2275
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:39,104
The people that

2276
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,736
Finding out there

2277
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,416
Isn't going to go hahaha

2278
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,440
You got her

2279
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:02,912
The feelings a little bit longer really know where the feeling

2280
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,680
Come from

2281
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:07,776
There is death mask

2282
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:19,040
Look I don't know I made the ceiling today

2283
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,368
It's not it's

2284
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,696
It's not a defensive carry for her own sake

2285
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,232
It's

2286
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:29,536
It's a defense based on what

2287
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,376
Anybody being the target

2288
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,144
Something like this

2289
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,192
I would probably be like this doesn't

2290
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,472
Seem sincere

2291
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
No matter what

2292
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,360
I don't know it is always kind of funny the idea of like

2293
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,152
Intersect battles

2294
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,968
Community

2295
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,016
External view would be like

2296
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,368
One survived

2297
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,392
If it's obviously project

2298
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:58,208
There's much funnier territory there

2299
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:06,656
I'll probably still watch a documentary but I've got a stream

2300
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:15,360
Arthritis

2301
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
Up to you but I needed

2302
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,480
On Friday

2303
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:23,296
With a new episode

2304
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,136
Yeah

2305
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:29,184
Thank you

2306
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:31,488
Knowledge

2307
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,024
You can also get a second

2308
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:44,032
Say that they will give you investment advice

2309
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:49,152
B Capital stock market

2310
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,176
Space stock

2311
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
You could

2312
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,832
Do that or you could get like

2313
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,136
Right now okay

2314
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,672
Because what are the Giants.

2315
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,488
Perfect idea for us

2316
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:10,144
How would anyone ever confirm or deny the value going up or down complete control the narrative

2317
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,424
I predict

2318
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,704
Someone will eventually

2319
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,520
Like that

2320
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
Resource

2321
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:23,456
Futures in like asteroids

2322
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:31,392
Dab asteroids

2323
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,184
Futures

2324
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,768
Anyway we have Twitter

2325
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:42,656
Betrayed

2326
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,776
What else do we do

2327
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:51,104
And many other podcast

2328
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,384
We are told

2329
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,992
I got to say Jordan

2330
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:57,760
What are you got to say

2331
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,808
I have to say what

2332
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:01,344
The archaeologist

2333
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,368
Feline space

2334
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,648
Contessa

2335
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,184
Never killed anybody

2336
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,768
Tell you that

2337
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:15,168
Spirit resonates that she has never killed anybody

2338
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,448
Cat alien

2339
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,288
Innate

2340
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,568
Contribute

2341
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,104
To the totality

2342
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,896
Information of the universe and I respect

2343
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,920
But she's never killed any

2344
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,992
Probably has

2345
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:38,464
I love your work
