First order of business

00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
Coronavirus live stream but ended up cutting it out of

67
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
The episode

68
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
Because I thought that the way I framed it was for

69
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
Alright so you had some time to think about it

70
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,575
You've written in your dreams

71
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
Propose

72
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
I knew

73
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439

They cannot marry you

76
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
I'd like to

77
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
Couple months back we had a little bit of a drive

78
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Towards that

79
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,311
Raising a certain amount of donations

80
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
Launcher game game coverage

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Which ended up

82
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,503
Lobbying 9 hours long and

83
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Defeating

84
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,903
Describing a kind of

85
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
I would like to do a similar thing

86
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,047
With Alex Jones is Spiritual Bible

87
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
The book that woke him up

88
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
None dare call it

89
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,447
Conspiracy right I've been going through it and I realize we can't do it as podcast

90
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
It would be 30 hours

91
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
Gun

92
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
Especially writing a book

93
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
About

94
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Why this book

95
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Okay

96
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
Cuz I'm going line-by-line through this f****** thing

97
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Constructing

98
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
So much of why it's wrong

99
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
All of the context that getting off

100
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
How many let's say

101
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
Nazi apologist propagandist

102
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Star quoted as primary sources

103
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
Mysteriously

104
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Things like that

105
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Understand correctly

106
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
You're next

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,919
Marathon reward

108
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
Given out as we reached some sort of

109
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Is going to not

110
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Feature me at all

111
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,279
Must work for you

112
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,799
Just let me go don't let me run over with a red pen

113
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,615
This is going to come out

114
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
Probably

115
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,015
As we get to the end of it

116
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:51,135
It'll be up on knowledge buy.com it'll be a series of blog posts that all

117
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Just be deconstructing all of this

118
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,303
And I will begin to release at what the incentive that I am going to propose

119
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
And maybe people think this is stupid but I don't want

120
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
People who already donate to

121
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
To the show to feel like they need to get more

122
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Baby feel like they have to like

123
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,383
Maybe you donate more than they're comfortable with originality.

124
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Any kind of

125
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,711
Because people would want this to be

126
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Released

127
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
I don't want

128
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
I think some people would and I don't want them to feel like I'm a

129
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,183
Going to give more money and make this happen so what I'm going to propose

130
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Are things that are positive

131
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Right

132
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
Punish you with a book report

133
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
I propose

134
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
15 new donors

135
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
New donor

136
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,407
From the time they were recording this which is Memorial Day 2018

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Until the end of June

138
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
Throughout the month of June we can get 50 and new donors

139
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
We will have our Easter

140
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Easter sale

141
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,927
Percent off releasing the post

142
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
About what's wrong

143
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:04,863
With none dare call it conspiracy and why only a stupid person would ever fall for the b*******

144
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
It's listed with it

145
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,543
Alright

146
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
And I've anybody would like

147
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,807
Independence Day

148
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
The lizard

149
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
No

150
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Raptors

151
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Batman

152
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Whatever

153
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
I am nothing if not

154
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
The desire to correct

155
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,151
I needed to I need to call myself out about this on the last episode I ended up cutting out something at the

156
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
The beginning after we released

157
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
Diversion

158
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
This diversion

159
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
And just because I'm

160
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
I like to smoke myself

161
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,767
Operating on a little bit of lack of information

162
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,095
About 1,500 children who

163
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
I've gone missing from

164
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
The

165
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
Immigrant children

166
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,775
I completed a couple things and I

167
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
I spoke of that in an irresponsible way bad about that so I cut it out of the episode and I would like to

168
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
Call myself out

169
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
Before I head to

170
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
Taking it out and about that

171
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:36,255
Splitting up families and the children who are unaccounted for are completely different

172
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
Stories

173
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Conflating them

174
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Possibly not the right thing

175
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
I don't I don't know enough about it

176
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Stupid

177
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
On the other hand

178
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Both are

179
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,823
Well I mean

180
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,895
66 + 1

181
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,039
Kind of situation either of those f****** things happen

182
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
1500 children thing I read Ninja

183
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Perspective on it where

184
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,975
A lot of the people who were reported in town hall

185
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Do we like it

186
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,815
It's not that it's that they're released from custody to

187
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,399
To people like you might be family members or might be

188
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
A friend of the family or something like that

189
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,311
When they're checked up on their whereabouts are

190
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
It's possible that they're like

191
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
The person who

192
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
Care of them it is their Guardian doesn't want to

193
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
To answer questions

194
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,439
Necessarily mean they're in a negative situation they might just be

195
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
With guardians

196
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
You don't want to

197
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
Deal with the government considering what they're up to now 100 years

198
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
From now if we found a

199
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
A thriving civilization in a forest somewhere

200
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Then their Legend was like

201
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
Well then the white man came to take us away

202
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,783
My bad for creating a whole secret society

203
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,599
I just felt like a bit of a dumbass

204
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,951
What I looked more into it as I I feel like we should have

205
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
Be completely aboveboard and apologize

206
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
A little bit too

207
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Flippantly

208
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
No granted

209
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
Some of those people could be a negative situation

210
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
I hope that's not the case

211
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
But we don't know I don't know enough

212
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
I don't think we know enough

213
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
Pretty sure horrific government

214
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,015
Changing the rules on you at any given moment and destroying your life

215
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
Even if you're with a good home that's usually a f*****-up

216
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,815
Anyway the other thing is I need I need to give another correct

217
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:53,983
On our last episode we talked about Michael Rotondo the thirty-year-old guy who's getting evicted from his parents house

218
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Yeah

219
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
The show

220
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
I need to issue a correct

221
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
They did another epic

222
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,503
Here's another context drop probably going to be going over today

223
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,463
They are closing

224
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
I don't think you're a loser

225
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Wait

226
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:21,887
They kept going I thought we figured out how to be a surrogate father pretty quick

227
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Is Bailey got it miserable

228
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,263
So this is correct his own mistakes

229
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Part 2

230
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
The NeverEnding Story

231
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:38,015
Yeah they talked for a good hour and a half for employee roulette

232
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
Reverence

233
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
Then the War Room comes on or whatever

234
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Why Alex

235
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,303
Michael Rotondo the thirty-year-old whose parents took him to court to kick him out of the house

236
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
Who also has a conviction for stalking

237
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
They sit down across the table from each other

238
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
And have a bull session

239
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Because Alex realizes

240
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,639
He realized he couldn't be in this guy

241
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,831
Wait till he goes on a different show

242
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
I think it's recorded wow that show is happening but it's in a side like you

243
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,095
Yeah yeah

244
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
Giving the wall with a broom

245
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
I normally would say

246
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
Alright we talked we f***** up man we talked about the episode already we can't go back to the well

247
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
Really done this necessarily

248
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
Okay here part 2 of death

249
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
I don't think we've done that a lot

250
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Listen to this

251
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
There's so much more

252
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
Oh no no no no no

253
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Alex

254
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
Weird from themselves

255
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Take

256
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
Zach weird guy completely out of the equation

257
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
This is all about Alice

258
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
I understand that

259
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Goes

260
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
So esoteric

261
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
He gets

262
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
He's talking in riddles

263
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
Lightly diet

264
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Closed to vehicular

265
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,983
There's two of me one over tell the truth what kid only lie

266
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
What's good

267
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,663
This goes so far off the rails there's no way around

268
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:48,063
We have to go over but the other thing is there's one more correction I need to make before

269
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,391
We get out of the shop I meant to say

270
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,207
On the last episode and I didn't make it clear enough

271
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
And I really regret it

272
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,071
I was thinking about editing into the episode just a little bit of my voice being like

273
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
A pretend that you just didn't

274
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
Respond

275
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
Make

276
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Clear enough

277
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Is that

278
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
And then he went back to his home planet

279
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
Michael Rotondo is 30 years old

280
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Right

281
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
How long how long did you say you've been living with his parents

282
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,623
Leeson's Elian Gonzalez 8 years

283
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
You've been living with his parents

284
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
How old was Michael Rotondo

285
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
When he got arrested for stalking a woman

286
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
2222

287
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
The reason he probably moved back in with his parents

288
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
Was because he got arrested for stalking a lady

289
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,663
Is not really

290
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,063
Argument

291
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,647
Oh hey also get this but he has a different address

292
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
When he was clearly living on his own

293
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Right

294
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
So

295
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
Got arrested for stalking a lady

296
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
Yeah and then some point a little bit later that year he moved back in with his parents

297
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Coincidence

298
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Can happen

299
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
F*** you

300
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Now baby

301
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
That was Judas

302
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Jordan

303
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
What are we doing

304
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
This is so f***** up

305
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,583
If I let me let me make a

306
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
Prediction

307
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Allen I love

308
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
Alex Alex is going to

309
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Channel

310
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
The ghost of his father's

311
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Parenting

312
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Through this child

313
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
And speak

314
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
2 it's in the

315
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
The past as though it is something that he wishes

316
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Had been happy

317
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
My friend there will be ghosts

318
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
Anyway

319
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,559
Episode starts the video start the livestream is an hour long

320
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
Start

321
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
With I don't know at least

322
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Like 10 seconds

323
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
It's not fair

324
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,055
Mike rotundo sitting at a table

325
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Fiddling with the mic

326
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,943
But there's an innocent

327
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
Who's awful Alex walks into frame

328
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Some bottles

329
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Superman

330
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Which

331
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,719
Hold on

332
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,887
Cuz it comes in at the beginning

333
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Superman the whole time you're like

334
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,287
Yeah you got supplements on the table

335
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Nope

336
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,447
It was just

337
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
He's bothering them up

338
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,783
So this is almost just recapping the

339
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,135
At least

340
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Yeah

341
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:50,495
Bright light.

342
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,359
Demon in the world

343
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,943
Pushes

344
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Disagree

345
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,335
This whole millennial

346
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,831
You are very very complex

347
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
Well

348
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,999
But I think that I just am doing the best I can read been sitting for the reasonable effort

349
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
But I don't think it's really anything

350
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
Wrong with the things that I've done some wrong things

351
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
By the things that I've done

352
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Yeah like what

353
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
Like earlier episode he say that he

354
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:07,295
Can't think of anything he's proud of his daddy's brother smarter than him

355
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
Is what he said the kids 8 years old

356
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Yeah well that's probably

357
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Panfish bait

358
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:16,255
Flying around here

359
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,631
His son was born in the same year

360
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,471
What is the person who I don't know who he was talking was cuz

361
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
Whose names are confidential

362
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
Please mother

363
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,407
That would also explain why he's not allowed to

364
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
But he had visitation rights

365
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
For some of the time

366
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
I believe

367
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Made it so he couldn't talk

368
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
To the kid anymore

369
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
Yeah he's not allowed to have

370
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,719
If you was stalking her back that I would assume

371
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
No contact from

372
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
The jump right

373
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
Yeah but they're all those f*****-up Lowe's in America where it's like you're rapist

374
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Can still have visitation

375
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,263
Yeah like that kind of thing I don't know like America's a f*****-up place

376
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
I don't know if your

377
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Ques laws are like

378
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
10

379
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
It also introduces the idea

380
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,503
Wasn't her 8 years ago he has a baby with one lady

381
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
He's talking to another lady gets arrested

382
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:22,304
His baby's mom is like f*** off get out of here but that would still leave him in

383
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,120
Situation where I like it's not enough to not have rights

384
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Missy your child

385
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,264
I think it should be I'm not

386
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Probably like

387
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
I don't know how to parse it other than to say I'm not for any other

388
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:46,880
But I don't think we have a hero in any of this this episode

389
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
The hero

390
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,864
But he's not a hero either

391
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,080
Just swoop in and put them on a backpack and then he died

392
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,872
Climbed up Mount Everest

393
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Together and he's like

394
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
I am giving you all I know and then he becomes

395
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
When's the next the next

396
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,976
See everybody settling into their new roles

397
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Are the new Rodger

398
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,192
Training them

399
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
That's why I take you

400
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,872
Got it

401
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Everything

402
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
So he was unable to

403
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
To deal with

404
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
The question what's your greatest

405
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Achievement

406
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
The show yesterday

407
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Alex

408
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Does not have such a

409
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Although

410
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,936
A little bit of humility

411
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,528
Starved Rock

412
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
But sometimes

413
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
What would you say your

414
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,280
Earlier

415
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,592
The world

416
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,232
Americana

417
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
I have

418
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,176
You kept was around about 15 years before I ever had

419
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,400
You sent forth

420
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Achievement

421
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Is

422
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Creating a movement

423
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
That would help stoop

424
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:52,224
Ruining multiple countries

425
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Redheads

426
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
History when I was nine so that

427
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
Now I've toppled f****** Britain

428
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:05,792
Normalcy

429
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
Brittany

430
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,472
Book when I was 12 an hour

431
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,848
Johnny Appleseed founding father of fascist movement around the United

432
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,968
Around the world

433
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Global

434
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
Boner

435
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:31,136
4

436
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
What's my proudest

437
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Achievement

438
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
Firstbeat

439
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,280
Being super confident

440
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:46,240
Mixture has led to a lot of good things

441
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,056
Attribute

442
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
This amazing ability

443
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
Even though he doesn't need to be

444
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
No but listen to this

445
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Name-dropping

446
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Show me some of the notes

447
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
No idea

448
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Alright

449
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Hold on

450
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
And

451
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,152
The weirdest want to talk to me

452
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,072
He is both Hank Hill

453
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
And the other guy

454
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
King of the Hill

455
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,920
Everyone who's ever talked to Mike ever about

456
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,272
King of the Hill to the copious numbers of interviews he's done

457
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
Involved in the show is a one-man operation okay

458
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:15,584
Just just Alex

459
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,312
The entire show is based on his show

460
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,712
Now also Access TV

461
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,272
I would say that that show

462
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,112
I don't I don't know if my dates are totally right here but I

463
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,184
Probably Premier 20 years ago 22 years ago

464
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Alex Jones

465
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:48,608
Is 44 right now 9:40 he was King of the Hill

466
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
King of the Hill

467
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,240
Everybody knows that that balding

468
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:58,848
Two-year-old father-of-two

469
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:05,248
Twenty-two-year-old lunatic got into Public Access TV

470
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
Dumb conservative

471
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,880
Pretending to be libertarian radio

472
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
So stupid

473
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,424
Alright so he spends a long time

474
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
The neighborhood I had to drive

475
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
Redbad was Iowa

476
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
Someone was dead on the street

477
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,880
I don't know about that

478
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,464
F*** you I'll let you have it

479
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
All done that doing stand-up

480
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
At any rate

481
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,888
Talked about how

482
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
He made

483
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
His first film

484
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
America

485
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Destroyed by

486
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Design

487
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
And he did it on

488
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Badcock

489
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
Auntie ended up flipping it

490
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
The Macon

491
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Cool half mil off

492
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
Billion dollars

493
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,344
And then he turned it around and put it back into the business

494
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,648
Annette something Millennials could never get over

495
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,744
So here is him talk about this when he accidentally slips and talk a little bit

496
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
But too much about the money

497
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
My cousin

498
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Question for

499
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
Dollars

500
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,424
Car

501
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,616
All that money

502
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,944
Sheriff

503
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
Yes that's the weather manipulated

504
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
I'm not doing this to me

505
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
Okay

506
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,728
This is this is a logical

507
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,296
I bet he just does that and what's the temp

508
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:56,256
Pacifically

509
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,888
You acting weird

510
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:08,032
Dragon very suspicious about something

511
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,360
This is how I would talk to you if we were on camera

512
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
I'm starting to tell about all these accomplishments

513
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
I made

514
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Livelook

515
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
Half a million dollars

516
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
Bridgeport

517
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Now it's 40

518
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,256
I mean we are a shoestring operation

519
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
If he's like legitimately he's ever brought in 40 million dollars through his sales in a year last year

520
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
You went on record

521
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,896
Is that the cost 13 million.

522
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,736
Billion dollars in operation

523
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
That is a prophet

524
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
27 million dollars

525
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,416
Right where is that money going if not to Alex Jones

526
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Buckley

527
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,256
And the HR department

528
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,864
Lakeview I'm sure it's at 8

529
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,264
Exaggerated

530
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Target once

531
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Expensive

532
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,152
You buy one of those little runs out immediately

533
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,760
So he just goes on and on here about how like

534
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,512
Just because he's trying to deflect

535
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
I'm talking about his own

536
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
He's just talking about

537
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,888
Go do it

538
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
He's trying to present itself like

539
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
Used some sort of elevate

540
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
It's not that important

541
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
Trust me where we're going

542
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
We don't need to

543
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,872
Texas

544
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
Alright

545
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
That is a

546
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Nicotine

547
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
My son work

548
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Mike Rotunda

549
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,072
Talk to you I wish I would have got her legs

550
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
I just want you to know that

551
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
They're the ones promoting

552
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:29,088
Millions of sex changes in the country

553
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
I don't think so

554
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
So he's really containing

555
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
He's confused by this but

556
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
It's really fun

557
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
To like

558
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,912
To look at like the reality of what insurance does cover

559
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,520
Because if you get rhinoplasty you can convince doctors that it's

560
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:54,176
Cosmetic medically Medical Group

561
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,784
So there are a lot of nose jobs that do end up getting

562
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:04,160
Conned into being covered by by Healthcare

563
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:10,304
Now if he wants to talk about her one for yourself you know what I mean, right there

564
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
Maurice Chevalier

565
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,104
The other thing to do is like gender correcting surgeries

566
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
Mariana

567
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
Diamond Millions

568
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Formed in the

569
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
United States

570
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
Take taxes from

571
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
I mean I mean

572
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:47,680
Right I don't know I don't know millions of these perform

573
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,496
. no

574
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
The the number

575
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
Specific numbers are kind of iffy

576
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,408
I was reading this one article about how

577
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
Gender confirmation surgery

578
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Percent in 20

579
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Steam which makes

580
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
It seemed like that is a lie

581
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
Fight

582
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
Tiny amount but if you read the article less than

583
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
5% of us

584
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
Procedures involved any kind of

585
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
Genital

586
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Surgery

587
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,864
There are no large numbers of you know chest

588
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,168
Surgeries that satar down weathering

589
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,472
Increasing or decreasing

590
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,544
This article here in Denbigh

591
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
BBC News

592
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
I will

593
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,688
I will concede that the beginning of this article

594
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
It does say that

595
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
The Bubba Bubba Bubba

596
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088

Exergen

598
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
I haven't

599
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
Some questions about the data

600
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
Or the data was supplied by them

601
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
And there are some questions about it suits not

602
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
The best

603
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
The data button terms

604
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
The specifics about

605
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
What is able to fly

606
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Didn't delete it

607
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,936
Then delete the articles that mean something

608
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Thanks anyway

609
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,776
It's only 15 total operation

610
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
In 2016

611
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Genital

612
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Correction

613
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,480
Millions of them

614
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,552
If you have no idea if those 15 were paid for by out-of-pocket

615
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
Or any of that

616
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
No clue

617
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,184
I was just making s*** up to be mad at

618
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
Cuz he hates marginalized

619
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Myscripps

620
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,792
We're not done with no jobs though cuz I was going to talk more about that

621
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
Roshes

622
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
I like it

623
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
Exercise

624
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,184
That's how that works

625
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
My wife will sweetheart

626
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
You want to spread what you're

627
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
You want to

628
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
Make some change you want to

629
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
Pinochet cop some things you want to

630
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736

Cancel

632
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
I would say an encouragement

633
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Talkington

634
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,384
You fighting for his life against them sort of vicious

635
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,688
Demon against the wall

636
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:44,576
Happening in between this

637
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
Pools of the whiskey

638
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,256
Yelling at a wall about problem

639
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Trying to

640
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,120
The same time walk this guy down a path

641
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,912
Cuz he's trying to indoctrinate him

642
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
To certain extent

643
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
Why do you got to go in

644
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:17,344
Playlist Kelly this is ex-wife

645
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,208
Okay talked about that before the past

646
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,608
How can I say has material to the wall he's just like doing Vapes he's checked out

647
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
The rest of it is him just being like

648
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,544
You know what what is it what is human empowerment

649
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,872
Don't ask a question like that

650
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,456
But it's much more

651
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
F*** you

652
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
He's trying

653
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Sing 2

654
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
I don't think

655
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,416
It's a question that has an answer

656
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
Ask her the question

657
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Can possibly know

658
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,024
And you will never get that question right

659
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
Because the answer is whatever it is you didn't say

660
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Wait until this plays out

661
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm telling you

662
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,240
This is the beginning of him attempting to be like

663
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Now what do you think about this

664
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,640
It's in trying to butter him up at

665
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
Is it like the book

666
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
There's two things that play Beyond him

667
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,016
Complaining about his wife's nose to the wall

668
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
Which is one piece of this that

669
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
Definitely present

670
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
The other parts

671
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
Made him cuz he thinks it would be a good gift

672
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
He'll be a big get

673
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Infowars

674
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
For publicity sake

675
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
If they get this guy

676
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
And fix him up get him a haircut get him on

677
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:38,496
Workout routine you know like this would be huge for him alright

678
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Propaganda

679
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,616
But then the other side of it Infowars version of The Biggest Loser

680
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Play

681
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,856
The wall cuz Alex

682
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
As he's trying

683
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
To do this dialectical thing where he's like

684
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
What is human power

685
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
There's more

686
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
There is

687
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,376
Working for it

688
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
He gets lost in thought

689
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,104
This is again presentation to go along with his writing down ideas

690
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,504
He has like what you're good at Electronics

691
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,880
If it was because it's just so base

692
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
African crafts

693
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:31,488
It seemed just trying to steal a little bit of this guy's shine

694
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,560
Famous right now in rap heavy

695
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,168
Can you stealth the whole time

696
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:44,032
Business hours

697
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
I want start Deadpool

698
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Looks like

699
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,808
You got to believe

700
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
Wheelbarrow

701
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
President

702
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Didn't care

703
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,248
We can all pretty much get something

704
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,808
That was your point that was your point

705
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
That was your point

706
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Which is greater

707
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,560
Cuz I

708
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
That's a mean

709
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,360
This is great

710
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
This is

711
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,199
Alcoholic divorce

712
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,951
We didn't get a good run

713
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,279
That

714
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
By ear course I mean

715
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Bucking when I was 11

716
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,759
Job selling memberships

717
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,903
So those are two jobs that are pretty appropriate for Alex

718
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
No they're very

719
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,583
Usually train track you in contract

720
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
Formally very KT

721
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Distant

722
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,543
How did not allow blacks

723
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,591
Irish or women

724
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:04,319
Very open-minded Country Club

725
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
Golf courses part-time Sullivan

726
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,615
Golf Course

727
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Store

728
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,975
Wasn't

729
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Platform

730
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Right

731
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,727
Make a film

732
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
And the lister's responded

733
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
So do it

734
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,647
Doing a production for doing that ideology

735
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,999
Here is where I think

736
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
As much of a

737
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
But s*******

738
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,119
Michael Rotondo is in the fact that he stalked a woman

739
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,191
Is unforgivable and he's not an empathetic figure

740
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Still not an idiot

741
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
Because he has

742
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,799
Some sort of

743
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:34,943
Presents on the Spectrum to understand the social cues

744
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,343
Good way to be a portal into things Alex said all fair that he doesn't realize he's not supposed to

745
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,255
Bushman ideology Center

746
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
If you called him

747
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:59,007
Whatever

748
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,591
Redondo is saying that it's clearly like

749
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
The way you phrase

750
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
What's the Miami like

751
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
That's a problem

752
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Means that the things

753
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
Do you say probably

754
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Through a filter

755
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Here's where things turn

756
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
I don't mean to say that a couple times

757
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,767
But here's where one of them

758
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Comes

759
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,327
Text Alex trying to be like

760
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Save you

761
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,679
You came off

762
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
Okay

763
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,871
Tell me the court May when they took your son away from you

764
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Brood

765
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,391
That looks very reasonable characterization what happened

766
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Do you mean they said that

767
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Actually go out

768
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
Have a mission

769
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
Ecology

770
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,791
Thinking

771
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,143
Cuz you're smart

772
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,775
Miserable have this was

773
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Amazing

774
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
This

775
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,223
Here's a Alex's prescription

776
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,599
Become a completely different person

777
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Stop being that person

778
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
Everybody else's

779
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:03,679
Describing as a pile of s*** everybody's

780
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,519
You're incompetent everybody else did legally

781
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
I would

782
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
David what makes this

783
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
Funny is

784
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
Alex

785
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,247
But what makes it not funny is the reality that like

786
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:24,927
16 or fail Alex is hurting this country

787
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,743
You're not dealing with the underlying issue that he's

788
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,791
He has a mental illness

789
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
She needs to be

790
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,215
You need to help Village to raise a thirty-year-old as long as

791
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:41,567
Yeah from the chat room

792
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
Predict that there this is

793
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
Jordan Peterson

794
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
InStyle

795
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,527
Advice

796
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,855
Too much with Peterson so I don't I don't know a lot of his

797
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
Is pretty

798
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Particular quirk

799
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,975
He's but it does it does that sound right

800
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
From what I have what I've heard

801
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
Stop Jordan

802
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
On the last episode

803
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
We learned that Mike Rotondo

804
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Cuz we're buddies now

805
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
How we learned that he's

806
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
Running a business

807
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
We never knew you had

808
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,895
We don't know what that other business

809
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,711
We don't know what that

810
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,759
This is he never made it clear

811
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
And luckily I'm this episode

812
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:40,191
And I don't want to connect the two things that I want to bring

813
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
Yeah I don't have the infrastructure to support

814
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
Did I mention

815
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,367
You can always go

816
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Can I be clear I didn't

817
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Cut there

818
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
But he said

819
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,703
I think what he's trying to say is if this is your passion project

820
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Their business

821
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
To pay for this passion

822
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
I think that's what he

823
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,407
If that's what you trying to say I get it but these nuts

824
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
No he's not doing that well

825
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,991
Let's see where this goes

826
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
Brightness

827
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
What is the

828
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,055
What is the weather

829
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
Information technology

830
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Okay

831
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,207
It's not really an idea

832
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
Let the stuff

833
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
Are you get for me works

834
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
CERN

835
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:23,359
Whatever it Whatever It Is

836
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
We go through with it

837
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
This is a bad business

838
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
This model

839
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
This is bad

840
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:36,159
Is it the business

841
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Maybe

842
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,047
Worn down enough to like be like

843
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
There's nothing

844
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,423
I just I just whatever it is I'm doing I'll do it well

845
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Yeah

846
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
I'll help you with technology

847
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
And I'll do it well

848
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
I think that's what he saying

849
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
Does the it stuff is like I'll fix

850
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,175
Stuff I'll fix your machines

851
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Your Tech issue

852
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,967
Use but I'll do this

853
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,319
I don't know but whatever it is it like if I were on Shark Tank

854
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
I'd be like bro

855
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Go

856
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,975
I'm not buying in

857
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:16,607
What are you going to do

858
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,191
It's not so much and it's an ideology

859
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
Haha

860
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,007
If you get it from me it's going to work

861
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
What do you think

862
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
User

863
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
Are dead.

864
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,455
Department of dreams and wishes

865
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:37,855
What's your Five-Year Plan to give people what they want

866
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
This is no good

867
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
Alex

868
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
Metaphor that

869
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
You got to play with the

870
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,335
That's not what that metaphor means

871
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
Poker

872
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:07,295
The expression you have to play with the cards you're dealt means that you have to accept the situation in front of

873
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Have you as it is

874
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,391
So if you don't like out 26

875
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,439
Or something like that that's

876
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,999
Field much off that

877
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
Super Lucky

878
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,631
36 is pop out on the board then you've got the best hand ever but you can't control that

879
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
So what you doing

880
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,935
Play with the cards you're dealt

881
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,519
For a better opportunity

882
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,079
Or you going to block it and pretend you have

883
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Pocket aces

884
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,967
You know what I'm saying that's what the metaphor means

885
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,295
You got to play with that cards then do well in you'll get Aces

886
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,159
No

887
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
He's framing poker

888
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,767
Classic American Dream

889
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:55,167
It's about pulling yourself up

890
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,519
If they see that you got bad cards and you win there like hold on we got to get you out of

891
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:05,919
We got to get you into the car to the car.

892
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:12,063
They're all locked.

893
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:22,047
I know that's a little tiny thing

894
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,863
Understand or use

895
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,191
Stop using that

896
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,007
Blows my mind

897
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,079
Most of this episode is largely going to be us listening

898
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,639
To Mike Rotondo and it being confused

899
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,759
Right like not understanding what Alex is trying to sit down on the table

900
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:47,903
The hold on there's a bunch of Alex's in the wrong

901
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
So

902
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Hellboy

903
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
Here's a here's where everything turns

904
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,223
I just cuz you mean

905
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
Right

906
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,207
Black person

907
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,271
Will not discuss racism

908
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,807
People who are not black

909
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,647
Can understand it NetSpend it's fine if

910
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,439
People who are black can't understand it

911
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,255
But not sharing it

912
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
Is the wrong approach

913
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,935
Real

914
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,943
Did like the media or just

915
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,807
Kill a billion

916
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,903
Tell me how the goddamn racism is it

917
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,951
Wow

918
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
Wow

919
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,959
Pictures of

920
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,775
Supportive conversation with Alex Jones

921
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
Because we have

922
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,895
Listen to Alex Jones

923
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,967
For the past year-and-a-half I understand what

924
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,527
You say right

925
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,087
Did not if I had no contacts

926
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,927
I know this guy is a

927
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
You f******

928
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Batman

929
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
Yeah

930
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
I also

931
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,351
Even then at like

932
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,935
If you were around

933
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:14,335
There's eight of you around black races I had black friends and then

934
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,943
I am better than everybody else who thinks about white race

935
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
And I can't possibly be one of them

936
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,295
We're also sad what

937
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
F****** idiot

938
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,647
He's bats

939
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:33,791
Really believes is true even though it doesn't make a goddamn bit upset

940
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,143
No and so I looked into it cuz I wanted to

941
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:43,775
I don't understand exactly where it says billions of people who are going to be killed by 5G

942
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
3 billion

943
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
Important

944
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,967
Things that I found that were particularly interesting to

945
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,295
One of them is that whatever he talks about this story

946
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,575
Dimensions

947
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,879
An article

948
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
Screen

949
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,695
Article from Wired Magazine

950
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,535
Haha and the headline from this Wired Magazine article

951
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,327
That they always Flash

952
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
Have you never read

953
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,911
Right never go over much

954
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
Is

955
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,239
Are big bold letters

956
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:19,615
5G smartphones cause cancer big Wireless doesn't want you to know

957
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,479
If you read the actual article it starts

958
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:29,087
I've been waiting and waiting for this particular form of popular fear to surface again

959
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
Okay

960
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
Already done

961
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:41,631
Yep from the first sentence does everybody who think this is

962
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,167
F****** stupid

963
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:49,567
You seen this before it happens every time every time we got our first one we got a little

964
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Mark on the board

965
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:54,943
So then there's another there's a stud a study in the LA Times

966
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
About

967
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,527
Slight increase in Cancers and

968
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Rap

969
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
There were supposed

970
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
T5g

971
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
Future

972
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,183
And it's a very slight

973
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,583
I don't think it's

974
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
It's clear that there are helpers

975
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,167
But it's clear that there are no hell

976
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
Leslie can I keep it

977
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,335
An epidemiology professor at UCLA Fielding School of Public Health

978
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,359
The health effects

979
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Cell phone

980
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
So I don't

981
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,479
Noted expert says

982
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,783
Truck

983
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:40,511
Who cares about racism

984
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
We could be cancer

985
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Bright

986
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
Dirt bike

987
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:49,471
There might be slight increases

988
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
Alex

989
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
BBQ

990
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
Get rid of them

991
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,591
Get rid of every barbecue in America

992
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,639
Carson

993
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
Energetic how

994
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,991
Dairy burning charcoal briquettes is carcinogenic

995
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,063
Like regulate on that level if you want

996
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,391
They could bring the Callback job you don't understand like what

997
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
Is really like

998
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
Steak

999
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,791
Could be had with

1000
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
Strip steak

1001
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,399
With 5G

1002
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,775
Cuz it's not just things getting much faster in like being a

1003
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,591
Vina Wi-Fi speeds increasing what have you

1004
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Processing

1005
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,175
Speeds would go up to

1006
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
Any ability to do all these

1007
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,783
These things are impossible to do now with battery live

1008
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,343
And s*** like that it wouldn't strain your devices

1009
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,367
So heavily

1010
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,647
There's all kinds of

1011
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
Applications

1012
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,487
The ability to work anywhere

1013
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,303
And stuff like that

1014
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,095
And that's already given you

1015
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:53,215
Can't even with like my small-minded approach to it I don't even understand all the applications

1016
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,519
But these few that I can come up with

1017
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,055
Super exciting

1018
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,359
I don't know

1019
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,895
Maybe they're studying

1020
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Is the truth lighting

1021
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
Grieving cancer

1022
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,247
I think they're also need to do more studies

1023
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
I'm fine with that

1024
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Anyway

1025
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,671
At this point if it said maybe or maybe not

1026
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Good enough for me

1027
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,743
Cancel the whole thing

1028
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:21,887
I mean like what we're doing on racism

1029
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,703
All right we can't have 5G

1030
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
Racism dad

1031
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,031
I was just would love any

1032
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
He's not

1033
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Blerdcon racism

1034
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,359
Because he's

1035
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,431
Because he has on both sides

1036
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,271
Better than everybody else

1037
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,111
Scared like a little bit

1038
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
Really funny cuz my cousin

1039
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
That worried about 5.

1040
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,279
A billion people

1041
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:07,711
Because

1042
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,759
But the globalist

1043
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
Right

1044
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,599
Scientific consciousness

1045
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
It is completely cold-blooded

1046
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,639
Presidents of the racism

1047
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:40,223
More important than z5g thing because

1048
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,319
If we die sooner from cancer

1049
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
Does it matter

1050
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,183
If the queen

1051
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,255
Patron

1052
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:59,167
Spiritualism talking about

1053
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:08,383
This is The Scrambled spiritual

1054
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,967
Fired for a humanistic exist

1055
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
What's the rating of

1056
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
Alex

1057
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
His son in the bathroom

1058
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,903
1 timer

1059
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:23,743
Taking it all out on this kid right here

1060
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:33,215
I don't know I don't know if you can

1061
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,383
Of course it does but like I want it I want to say exact whip right there

1062
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,687
A little bit of a

1063
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,479
Like a moose Bouche

1064
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,295
It's a little taste

1065
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,855
Of like some of the stuff that Alex is going to

1066
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
To try and drop on him

1067
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Cuz he's not here

1068
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
He's not buying into this

1069
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:56,511
Probably doesn't want a job

1070
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,583
But he doesn't understand Alex's worldview and he's like

1071
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
Yeah I don't know

1072
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,935
I don't know but I don't think that's all that

1073
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,495
Steven says like I don't think

1074
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,287
Going to kill people

1075
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,079
I don't I don't believe that

1076
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
Alex

1077
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:17,247
Really getting mad because it's already established it like either I'm

1078
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,135
Going to save you or the globalists are going to write

1079
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,207
60 that the globalist to win in Alex's

1080
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,999
So

1081
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:34,399
This is the worst Scientology auditing session

1082
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,191
Like they're like

1083
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:46,175
It's not a big deal because otherwise

1084
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,479
Do you understand

1085
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
Sorry about that

1086
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,743
I do I did not know that

1087
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,119
Cuz it's

1088
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,895
Trio level human cloning

1089
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,943
I did not understand that

1090
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:31,487
Asians killing Asians is not like Oprah Winfrey

1091
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,071
Witcher features a dump black guy with a bullwhip

1092
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
Also did you know that there's

1093
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
What

1094
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
Really admired could come up with

1095
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
3

1096
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,295
Leave them together in a basket

1097
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,391
Tacular skill

1098
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,671
Any other come out

1099
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,439
None

1100
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,303
Amazing poetry reading

1101
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,863
His parents house at 30

1102
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,263
No s*** no s***

1103
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:19,871
I just thought I didn't want to make it to clear but

1104
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,455
I f***** up

1105
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
Play I blew our own game

1106
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,831
I'm so in this next clip we should get back

1107
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,159
Talking still in the same conversation little bit more about 5

1108
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:43,679
Problem

1109
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,543
Buddy of 5G is killing us

1110
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,871
Instead of saying what does it matter

1111
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,247
Frozen girl

1112
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,391
He's already

1113
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,327
Kill doesn't matter as long as we're loving

1114
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
You can say

1115
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,191
What I'm saying bye

1116
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:35,647
The 5G cuz realistically the infection we have

1117
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:39,743
Available to us

1118
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,023
What do you eat

1119
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
Okay alright

1120
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:48,191
Change this

1121
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,471
Bike

1122
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,751
Isn't there any like

1123
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,871
Tequilas

1124
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,175
Would you believe you eaten

1125
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
Would you believe

1126
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,015
Does that question

1127
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
Really not so much

1128
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,343
Much about finding out what he eats

1129
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Also

1130
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,927
Real quick

1131
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
By the way

1132
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,303
5G is killing

1133
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,607
Right and we should ban

1134
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
Cigarettes gun

1135
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,007
Alcohol

1136
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
Hyundai cars

1137
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,871
Necessarily

1138
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,991
Royal shirt

1139
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:37,599
Fracking all of the everything they're doing in Flint

1140
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,879

Because it's a counterexample to everything

1146
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
If if

1147
01:07:59,359 --> 01:07:59,871

1155
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:26,751
No standards that should be in place in terms of breathable air

Okay good

1178
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:59,935
So he gives him a half-used bottle of X2 cuz they couldn't find any more around the office

1179
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:06,335
It's one of those with liquid that comes with a dropper and Alex has on many occasions on his show just

1180
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,615
Dropped it

1181
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,407
You know that's kind of his behavior

1182
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
He's given this dude

01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:15,295

Now they're physically gross things I think it's the last physically gross thing

1189
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,983
Although X

1190
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,519
Accidentally Alex admits

1191
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
He's denied a whole bunch of

1192
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
The past

1193
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,159
Minnesota

01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,983

1195
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,287
But did you catch what he said there at the end

1196
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,359
That's what testosterone does

1197
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,663
Testosterone

1198
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:20,063
Or at least it's up if it's synthetic Lee designed in order to make you release more testosterone

1199
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,623
Which is the same thing as being testosterone

1200
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671

1201
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,999

I don't know if it's right or wrong but he treats his dude like a child

1211
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,511
Natural conclusion of that is he has to assign him a book report

1212
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,279
Okay

01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,031
Vicki was going to be a long one

1326
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,335
He also believes in blood libel

1327
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:12,223
From a sermon that he delivered on October 15th 2017

1328
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:18,111
They sacrifice children at the highest levels in Hollywood they drink blood of young kids this is a fact

1329
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,927
You remember when all the spirit cooking thing came out

1330
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,975
That's commonplace ladies and gentlemen

1331
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,791
Most of the Hollywood actors you go see onscreen what

1332
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
You don't know

1333
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
They bring a witch

1334
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,935
The getaway

1335
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:36,031
Personal which for like computer wish for

1336
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:45,503
The getaway

1337
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,111
And they allow Devil's to come into them before they take the part of what they're going to act

1338
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,183
It's a fact

1339
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:59,071
It's a fact it's a fact what I'm telling you

1340
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
Got the quote

1341
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,167
Now I'm reading this and it's hilarious

1342
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:07,263
But what I should tell you is I watched the sermon this is from a sermon

1343
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,359
He's walking around in front of a congregational granted it's like

1344
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,431
Get out of some sort of Nuvo

1345
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,063
It's more than you

1346
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:27,743
Hello dollar

1347
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
It's big

1348
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,559
But like it's

1349
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,839
Crazy like

1350
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
This is

1351
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,143
You said

1352
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
In the context

1353
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
Of a Sunday sermon

1354
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,983
Makes me very uncomfortable

1355
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,263
Like I don't I don't

1356
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,311
I hate this rhetoric wherever it exists

1357
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,871
My enemies drink children

1358
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
That's f******

1359
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,223
I hate I hate hearing it

1360
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,247
Boogeyman

1361
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,527
It's jarring

1362
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
Church

1363
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,903
It's f***** up not great it's really a place where that s***

1364
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:00,255
To not be happening

1365
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:06,399
Like what

1366
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:12,799
To the call this is Africa

1367
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:19,200
Gravitate towards other f*****-up places

1368
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:23,552
Who's better Braden.

1369
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:28,160
Weird ship sorry wait let me get through the rest of this by Howard Brower Rodney Brown

1370
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:32,768
Do you know Alex is like weird paranoid fantasies where he's like

1371
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,048
They take it down

1372
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:40,448
Mainline

1373
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,752
What's that makes sense why you can put up with

1374
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:47,360
Rodney Howard Browne has also been an Infowars guest

1375
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:51,968
Now you was on on March 19th 2018 and when he was on he described his

1376
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,040
A globalist Gremlins

1377
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,600
Alliteration

1378
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
Also

1379
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:05,280
That's it let's get some dirty.

1380
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,072
Rodney's from South Africa

1381
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
White

1382
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:17,824
America in 1987

1383
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,360
South Africa without meat

1384
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:25,760
When you're a white person fishes running away from seeing is around 1986

1385
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
To the tune of like

1386
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
200

1387
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
400

1388
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,560
200 400

1389
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,400
And those two years

1390
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:46,752
There's massive Global support growing for the three and Nelson Mandela movement

1391
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
Like

1392
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:53,920
Is taking over the country around 87

1393
01:21:54,176 --> 01:22:00,320
A little bit later in the wind that is not going to work for these white people and apartheid was on its way out

1394
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,088
This guy

1395
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:06,976
Who's clearly a con man thinking is I saw you and religion related behaviors was a

1396
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:10,304
Preacher in South Africa who's left

1397
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,608
In 1987 with his family

1398
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,888
To flee to America

1399
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,424
Makes me think

1400
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,520
I can't see any reason makes me think you was up

1401
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:27,200
You keep doing that

1402
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,992
Alex Theatre

1403
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:33,088
So that's one of the books that Alice wanted time here's the other one

1404
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,208
It's not God

1405
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:42,048
What is a three-week no no no

1406
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,632
This this this book

1407
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,960
This is a very important

1408
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,008
I don't want to come back and not have done my

1409
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,544
Homework

1410
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,128
You're not coming back

1411
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,968
Uncle Sam

1412
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,784
Type the names familiar

1413
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Doughboy

1414
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,160
Alex Bowman

1415
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:13,024
Personally offended you don't know who Rodger stone is

1416
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
You don't know

1417
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,376
Rolling my life away for this guy

1418
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,448
Have you don't even know who he is a b****

1419
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,520
So Alex has to explain who Rodger stone is

1420
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,800
If this explanation

1421
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
He's not

1422
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
Good

1423
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,640
Ibanez familiar

1424
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
Transformer wingman

1425
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,368
Kind of like

1426
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
Has your pets like a

1427
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264
No I haven't

1428
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,456
Okay

1429
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,504
Okay but

1430
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,808
Rodger Stone

1431
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,000
It what you already described as having a

1432
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:27,520
Wow that was so uncomfortable

1433
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,360
Donald Trump is a gay

1434
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
What's a wingman

1435
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,224
Say it say it say he's not gay

1436
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,016
Stagette you son-of-a-b****

1437
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:38,784
You say it

1438
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,448
You know what those

1439
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,496
Rodger Stone

1440
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,056
His wingman there wasn't anything to do with Russia

1441
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:06,688
He was just having extramarital Affairs all the time that Rodger

1442
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,600
To cheat on your wife

1443
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:19,744
Really

1444
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
Rodger Zapp

1445
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,192
He's a swinger

1446
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,728
Yeah

1447
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:36,384
Other alternative is cheating on his wife

1448
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,664
Is like super tense

1449
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,784
To be with Rodger make sense why he's hanging out with Rodger

1450
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
Hang out with this woman

1451
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,904
And it's also clear that Rogers

1452
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,464
Explain to Alex because Alex

1453
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,536
What's keeps bringing up the

1454
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:58,144
Did not make that another correlation about

1455
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
You know what appeared

1456
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,056
Bright

1457
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
To really make clear

1458
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,616
Is that

1459
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,896
When we started

1460
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
There were two people

1461
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
In this room

1462
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,784
Not you and I is that room

1463
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,368
Is a mentally ill person who stalked a lady

1464
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,904
It was on the show as a novel

1465
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,952
Rather guy wants to be his daddy

1466
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,512
Hey Mel got through it

1467
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:30,912
I still can't believe it this isn't like a terrible as Adele.

1468
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,776
As we've gotten to this point now

1469
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:39,104
I think that clip represents the point at which

1470
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:41,152
Who's Crazy in this room

1471
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,688
Chef

1472
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,832
Michael Rotondo

1473
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,160
In trouble

1474
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,976
But now Alex is more crazy than

1475
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,048
For the rest

1476
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:03,168
How is it still going on

1477
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:09,056
What are you talkin about we're more than halfway.

1478
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
I will say this

1479
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,872
Don't get scared

1480
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,408
The last clip

1481
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,944
I couldn't make a cut in it

1482
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,992
It's 5 minutes long

1483
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:22,112
Bryce dad

1484
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Alex

1485
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,208
Disgusting

1486
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,232
More wingman

1487
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,512
Stuff

1488
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:32,096
He gets a little conflicted about whether or not he cares about

1489
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
Rodger

1490
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,736
I would say that

1491
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,528
Common interests

1492
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
Can come and go as

1493
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,624
As the concerns coming out

1494
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,928
So but I mean

1495
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,512
That you can you can have a long-lasting

1496
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,632
Support from people who have come in person you and just frustrated

1497
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,728
Everybody knows

1498
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,568
For the Rogers

1499
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,664
Don't talk about Everybody's Talkin

1500
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,992
Rodger Stone

1501
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,144
The book should read

1502
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:46,080
What

1503
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,128
Roblox.com

1504
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,200
Amazon

1505
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,992
50

1506
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,648
Rodger

1507
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:09,888
I need to know what the f*** the deal is

1508
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:17,568
I think there's a little bit of weird conflicted anger that Rodger isn't selling the book exclusive

1509
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
Second person there

1510
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:28,064
He's clearly in a conversation with this guy was sitting across the table from him

1511
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,648
A copy of the book is probably going to go buy it on Amazon

1512
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,440
Go fuc yourself

1513
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,304
It's a simultaneous plug in love

1514
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,168
So Alex is like

1515
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:45,216
If you want to know what the point

1516
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,032
Seems like there's not one

1517
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:51,104
There's not much of a

1518
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,992
Kind of moving whenever he reject this dude is staying right here in the pocket

1519
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
And Alex

1520
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
Just trying to find a weakness like

1521
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,464
Okay

1522
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,280
Mike has

1523
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,584
It's very clearly taken

1524
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
But

1525
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,776
What's your take

1526
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,688
Weezer

1527
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,504
Personally I

1528
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
To have

1529
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,832
The ideology that you and I both have

1530
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
Define

1531
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,072
Grassroots

1532
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,888
Grassroots

1533
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,728
Here's what you need to know

1534
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:55,104
Here is where as what I hear is where everything turns

1535
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,736
Here is what you need to know is the sentence

1536
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:06,368
You f****** wish Alex never want to hear him say

1537
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:12,000
You never want to be a woman around him that's one thing you never wanted

1538
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,560
Caveat

1539
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:19,424
But you you want to hear him say this is what you need to know cuz you know things are about to

1540
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,960
To get f***** up

1541
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,496
Course they do

1542
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
Your greatest accomplishment

1543
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
Is the fact

1544
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,576

1545
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,368

Greatest thing that ever happened

1550
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,728
Oh my God is the greatest thing you've ever done

1551
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,800
Do you know what the name of this clip is on my computer

01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,384
White breeding for Generations has led to you

1553
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,712
That is exactly what he think

1554
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:08,832
And the talk of the like you know your ancestors are

1555
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,648
Through you and stuff like that

1556
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,184
But trust me

01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,976
He spells it out more here

1558
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,768
It deeply Disturbed

1559
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
Okay

1560
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:24,192

Sure

1564
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,464
In the entire vortex

1565
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
The Dominion

1566
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,512
Existence

1567
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,144
Hey Alex

1568
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,704
Everybody

1569
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,008
That's literally true of everybody

1570
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:05,408
Except black people

1571
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,944
I mean he wouldn't say this

1572
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:12,064
Two black guy

1573
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,088
Pure wipes

1574
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,624
It does feel that way

1575
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,768
Feels very much like breeding and the ancestry that he's calling back to and stuff like that

1576
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,816
Oh yeah it really really feels like

1577
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,864
This is this is definitely

1578
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,680
He was raised to believe that white people are chosen

1579
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,520
He was raised to believe that white people are superior which makes it

1580
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,800
So f***** up

1581
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:39,200
In Subway the Amy that he's trying to raise a thirty-year-old

1582
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,224

1583
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:44,320
Both versions of eugenic

1584
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000

But also there's more to it

1588
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,008
This is Mike Down Club

1589
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:07,104
I think this is one of the most profoundly f*****-up things I've ever heard Alex Jones say

1590
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,712
For a while

1591
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,016
What he's about to start talking about

1592
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:14,784
Is like

1593
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,112
This is why we're talking about Mike Rotondo

1594
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,136

Manifestation

1601
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,416
Teleportation

1602
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
What

1603
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:59,328
Dartmouth University

1604
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,520

We're all from each other

1608
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:34,912
They're good people

1609
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,008
Is like in my mother's womb

1610
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,640

Boy

1612
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:03,328
Do you think about that

1613
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,864
Is that

1614
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,168
Human

1615
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
Existence

1616
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,240
The very concept of

1617
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,336
Recognize that eventually a threat would come

1618
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,152
And so it

1619
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
Putting forth a plan of action

1620
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,832
Time to defeat

1621
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,856
V4

1622
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,904
Against Earth

1623
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:34,304
You're thinking of this a little kid from The Fifth Element

1624
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,584
Undoubtedly like

1625
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,632
Savior complex

1626
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,472

1627
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
Roast

1628
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,312

1629
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,080

Remain in the hospital forever from like the 50

1634
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:13,472
That idea when I was in my mother's womb

1635
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:21,408
Maybe he's a ghost maybe this is an asylum story where he was killed in an 1800 The Mentalist

1636
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:27,808
Silo and now we've come back to haunt us now through the radio

1637
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,048
That like you were looking at it too broad

1638
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:42,912
You're talking about there was going to be a threat

1639
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,728
Jacques lineage now granted

1640
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,544
That would be most of the people

1641
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,360
Related to The Tudors

1642
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,176

01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,248
In the womb

1645
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,296
He was downloaded

1646
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:04,928
Through the mitochondria

1647
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,464
Like in the movie move on

1648
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:12,352
And the mitochondrial DNA is Eddie Murphy as Mushu

1649
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,704
I don't understand

1650
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:21,824
There's trouble

1651
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,848
Shookbang

1652
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,128

You know thank God Alex

We're on the job globalism

1656
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:41,024
Globalism

1657
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,008
It's a lot of the Hot Load Anon

1658
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,800
And it also

1659
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:01,504
What's fiddle the visits make you angry

1660
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,904
Black people shirt off

1661
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,464
Which is also about your life

1662
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,000
Genetics

1663
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:12,768
Weaponized

1664
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,048
Also

1665
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,096
Like a lot of this

1666
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Is

1667
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,656
Crib from various

1668
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,936
Message Board post

1669
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,704
About the Illuminati

1670
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,544
So this is right this is all stuff

1671
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
Really important

1672
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,592
This is

1673
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:30,944
Like you know how Kerry Cassidy we'll talk to a murderer

1674
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,224
Do you know stuff about

1675
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
Secret space program

1676
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:38,112
It's becoming very clear to me especially as I look into 2009 stuff

1677
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,648
Readouts primary source

1678
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,672
Stuff like that

1679
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,744
He's the exact same in terms of not being

1680
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,512
Like

1681
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,560
Not caring about where he's getting

1682
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
Mason from

1683
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,632
As if you didn't talk to Mark Richards

1684
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,656
He just reads box

1685
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,960
He read the blogs and message boards and then

1686
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,984
Pretends that they are like

1687
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,264
This is the truth

1688
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,800
S*** like that

1689
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,824
It's insane

1690
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:02,688
Now I've just titled I'm deeply concerned about Alex's well-being

1691
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,224
That's a good thing to be

1692
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:11,136
Ancestors had will it existed and were amazing

1693
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
I want to be clear

1694
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,240
He's talkin gobbledygook

1695
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,288
Understand everything you say

1696
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:31,360
You know it's not like he's talking above my head

1697
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:36,224
I just he's using unnecessarily stupid words

1698
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:36,992
Right

1699
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:45,440
The function of me is what you're saying

1700
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,464
All of that

1701
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,560
Is physically

1702
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
Powerline

1703
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:11,552
Went through

1704
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,880
Alexander stand-up

1705
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,232
That's amazing

1706
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,888
You had a child

1707
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,960
Doesn't mean perfect

1708
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,520
What

1709
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:41,504
More powerful individuals

1710
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,296
Jump

1711
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,832
Which is going to be

1712
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
Kill this experiment

1713
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
Experiment

1714
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,144
This is all

1715
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:03,008
Message boards. My bread basket

1716
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:09,408
There's flickers of Harrison Bergeron

1717
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:13,504
Like a lot of this stuff about the idea

1718
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,528
You know

1719
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:20,928
Humanity

1720
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,976
I read on like above

1721
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:23,744
Top secret

1722
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,280
Aldi's

1723
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,072
Jackhole blogs

1724
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:31,680
That I used to read when I was younger it smokes a lot of weed

1725
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,472
He's just relaying all kinds of

1726
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:41,152
Feel like you should know better than I would come down

1727
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,200
That was fun

1728
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:48,576
What is like watching a scary movie

1729
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
Alex

1730
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,680
Come on now

1731
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,960
Just fix it at

1732
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,496
It's just online immersive fix

1733
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,032
And that's all that you're engaging in

1734
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Space

1735
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,872
It's real because his ancestors

1736
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:17,248
Diversification

1737
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,296
Traffic

1738
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,320
So

1739
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,088
Again

1740
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,880
This next clip is just labeled

1741
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,928
Deeply upset

1742
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,048
But I know that it's accurate

1743
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,864
You have to build

1744
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,912
The Stairway To The Rock

1745
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,984
You gotta

1746
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,480
Pillars of Fire

1747
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,016
Future

1748
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,672
Slow build

1749
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
To the next level

1750
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:04,096
People that decided

1751
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
Secret

1752
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,128
The door

1753
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:16,896
You don't ask

1754
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,456
For the trapdoor

1755
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,992
Adore

1756
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,832
What do you think

1757
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,208
But first of all

1758
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,280
I love

1759
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,800
No

1760
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,568
Demi Lovato

1761
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,456
What it is deeply upsetting

1762
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:57,856
Metaphysical stuff

1763
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,392
Concrete terms

1764
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:02,208
Like they're standing at a physical door

1765
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:06,816
And they don't know there's a trapdoor if you're trying to stop people from going through the door

1766
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:10,912
It's a sad physically really sad

1767
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,520
The sudden appearance of a trapdoor

1768
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
Trapdoor

1769
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,736
Crocodile

1770
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,296
But they're really chill crocodiles

1771
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,072
Roy's Auto Campground

1772
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:39,840
Saudi

1773
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:43,168
Thing is to like a lot of this is really it in Harkins

1774
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,472
Is Harkins to again

1775
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:47,008
Themes that are

1776
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:49,568
Like these these ideas are discussed on

1777
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:56,224
He's nwl Illuminati message boards online

1778
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
That horseshit

1779
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:57,760
Where do you buy

1780
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,856
You got a building

1781
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:07,744
Not the movie

1782
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,048
Does the Moneytree

1783
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,584
What what what is that

1784
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,656
Roosevelt Island

1785
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,472
Talk about this

1786
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,520
Universe and couldn't

1787
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,848
The trick

1788
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,616
Call real quick

1789
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,736
Yeah is the idea that Alex is going on this long

1790
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:30,016
About like

1791
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,040
Isadora

1792
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,720
My favorite things

1793
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:53,312
Because you wants to know

1794
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,480
What is it

1795
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,784
Or is not in here

1796
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:07,136
About the origin of these other things that are not

1797
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,184
Stop

1798
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,488
Where's the

1799
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,024
Perfect

1800
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,584
Numbers words

1801
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,752
But in the knowledge of evil

1802
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,800
His knowledge of distortion

1803
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,872
Okay

1804
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:41,440
Because we operate

1805
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,720
With a knowledgeable

1806
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,000
Are you following this

1807
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:51,936
Yes he's saying because we know good and evil it's okay for us to manipulate and distort things

1808
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:59,872
Well because if you don't use the knowledge of evil than yours right because these other people are manipulating and distorting things so why shouldn't I

1809
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:04,480
Do what I need to be able to golf because I'm so good

1810
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,016
To be a sheep like

1811
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:10,624
That's like what there was an a****** who's like you should be

1812
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,520
Because it's so seductive interview

1813
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,848
Portuguese chose not to be

1814
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,760
You shouldn't try when in the cinema

1815
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,064
Just got to stop

1816
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,624
Further

1817
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:47,488
Cuz I just basically said on-air is it because I'm so good

1818
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:52,352
Google

1819
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:00,032
He's getting so into that

1820
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:00,800
Space

1821
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:07,200
Where he's like I want to talk so big I wanted to try and use my flowery language

1822
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:13,600
Don't you want to be like me

1823
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:20,000
Rodger Stone has been Trump's wingman for 30 years

1824
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:32,544
Deliberately choose not to use the knowledge of evil rat totally this is a funny moment where we've gotten out of

1825
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,592
Esoteric stuff now

1826
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:36,384
There's a couple of

1827
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:38,688
Funny things that happen

1828
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,968
And then there's this last

1829
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:42,272
Clip where they're having to differ

1830
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:43,808
Free conversations with each other

1831
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:47,904
And it's so f****** my black but before we get to that Mike comes in

1832
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,256
It seems like it's going to be a critique

1833
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,024
Trump

1834
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:55,072
And then it turns red

1835
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,096
Very weird

1836
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,656
Do you ruined Donald Trump

1837
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,544
His personal doctor

1838
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,360
Yes

1839
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,664
She didn't it seem like it's going to end up being like

1840
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
Why would he do that

1841
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
Yeah it doesn't matter

1842
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:16,832
Turn down because you didn't experience running the VA

1843
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,112
Yeah that was why

1844
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,928
President

1845
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,000
Wrightwood CA

1846
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,840
Based on that person

1847
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:31,168
I think Mike started this question

1848
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,216
In a critical way

1849
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,496
Pushback on his eye

1850
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,080
Oh yeah yeah

1851
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,616
He's trying to make

1852
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Alex

1853
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,688
Yeah a little bit

1854
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,480
I think I think there's a decent

1855
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,040
From everything I can

1856
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:49,088
Tell her I would understand

1857
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,624
Cuz I don't have to sit in

1858
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:03,680
It's just that

1859
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:09,056
It also by the way it wasn't just the Trump try dewpoint is the personal presidential doctor

1860
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:11,360
Didn't fire the other guy too

1861
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,408
So are you

1862
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:17,248
Put in his own and also his personal doctor may have committed

1863
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,320
Possible possible

1864
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:26,464
The ones that he denied was just the one and it was like I was driving like that

1865
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,488
So now Alex

1866
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,256
Decides

1867
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,560
I got to fix this kid

1868
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,120
Was going to work

1869
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,656
Didn't do it

1870
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,936
I can't be around him

1871
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:41,056
He's miserable miserable talking to this guy he's like

1872
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:43,872
I got to find a new way and here's his first

1873
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,640
Vale

1874
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:48,992
You should want me to call you at 1.

1875
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,808
Dollars

1876
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,512
To show you not because

1877
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:03,584
Global Solutions

1878
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,936
Million people most of them are retarded

1879
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,496
This is been dead bodies

1880
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,032
Right now

1881
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,824
Alex is pretending to like

1882
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,872
His hand over the mic

1883
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,408
It's almost like he's talking

1884
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,688
Hey

1885
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:20,736
You know the cameras it's not really on right now

1886
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,808
There's 7 billion people in the world most of them a retard

1887
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,344
Not like you and me buddy

1888
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,368
It's like

1889
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,928
That moment when the knife salesman breaks

1890
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:32,512
Character

1891
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,792
This is

1892
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,560
Crazy

1893
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,864
But also I do like the idea of like

1894
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,632
Hey

1895
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:40,960
Charged $1,000 for 20 interviews and got 20 grand

1896
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,776
Go back to the part where he's Whispering because

1897
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,312
You need to experience this

1898
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,592
As a whole this is

1899
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,616
So f***** up

1900
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:56,064
There's 7 billion people most of them are retarded

1901
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,880
This is been dead by Design

1902
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,672
This is Alex Jones

1903
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,512
He's in the bathroom

1904
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,656
There's 7 billion people most of them are retarded

1905
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,216
This is

1906
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,056
Call everybody

1907
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:19,360
I really don't be part of this process

1908
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:22,944
I've been offered to be part of it

1909
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,736
I don't want you to

1910
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,528
Good

1911
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:36,768
But you repeating it back seat

1912
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:41,120
I'm talking to Standard Operating procedure at sizewell

1913
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,168
Okay

1914
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,472
Oh there

1915
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:48,544
Caught a lullaby cotton to transfer the computers

1916
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,640
Choices is not a

1917
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:55,200
Great thanks

1918
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,016
Haggai

1919
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,296
Alex

1920
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:01,088
What you're saying

1921
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,856
Easy

1922
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,648
Brainiac conscience

1923
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,696
What do you think isn't

1924
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Smart

1925
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,768
He's just using words that he knows

1926
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:11,584
Don't make sense to most people

1927
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,424
Will confuse people

1928
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,192
Exactly

1929
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:18,240
Space War exactly

1930
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,032
The cosmic

1931
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,312
It's a googolplex

1932
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,848
Yeah

1933
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:26,944
A decimal point

1934
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,992
Sub something

1935
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,040
Section

1936
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,320
Globes

1937
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,368
Just like

1938
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:40,000
It's not I'm not confused by what he saying I'm parsing his ideas

1939
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,024
And pudding like

1940
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:45,120
Things that are unrelated together comfortable with

1941
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,656
But when he's like

1942
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,424
This is how

1943
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,704
People at the talk talk

1944
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,824
Manifesting does Brainiac consciousness

1945
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,616
He's trying to impress him

1946
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,408
Easter saying

1947
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,432
Hey

1948
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,968
Send everybody home

1949
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:00,992
Stupid

1950
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:05,856
Yeah I'm not you and I aren't like that and look they

01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,904
Pacific fire weapons and kill everybody with

1952
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,464
Drew you know it I don't want

1953
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:15,328
That's the guy being like I wouldn't screw you up to kill you

1954
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,096
Girl

1955
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:20,448
I wouldn't know where to be able to devolve anyway you're not going to die

1956
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,752
It's totally fine I'm a brainiac

1957
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,800
Alex is playing out

1958
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,568
His own

1959
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:27,872
Sitting here

1960
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,664
No

1961
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,200
Alex

1962
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,528
Severe mental illness

1963
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,296
This is like

1964
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,648
I mean I know we're not Professionals in the Goldwater

1965
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:41,440
Rule does exist but

1966
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,976
This dude's crazy

1967
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:46,560
Does Mexico have Alex asks about drugs

1968
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:58,336
Everybody with that no

1969
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:03,712
Whatever

1970
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:05,760
Federal

1971
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,904
What they call

1972
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:16,256
Autism sisteron term for it

1973
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,792
Buick Century

1974
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,912
So he is trying to

1975
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,448
No no no

1976
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:30,848
No no no no

1977
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:35,968
We doing what are you doing

1978
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:39,296
He is trying to find something to pin autism

1979
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:44,416
What oil

1980
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:48,000
You know people would say you're something called

1981
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:50,304
You ever been around

1982
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,496
He is trying to find a way

1983
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,288
To blame this guy's

1984
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:02,592
Autism

1985
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:05,408
On the globalist

1986
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:10,272
I bet he'll be able to stay

1987
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,440
Jordan Jordan you're right on a bunch of

1988
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:19,232
These things with oil paint

1989
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,256
You are not

1990
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:22,816
Here's the next clip

1991
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,352
This is one of the

1992
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:28,704
That level of thought

1993
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,264
Because it does seem like that's what Alex would be

1994
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,800
It turns out what he saying

1995
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:36,640
Is it complete non sequitur question that leads to one of

1996
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,920
Razius

1997
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:41,760
Suggestions I've ever heard a human being make for another human being

1998
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:43,808
I bet when that suggestion is

1999
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,880
Alex gets really mad and rejected

2000
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,672
He feels very very sad

2001
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:07,616
You would make a little

2002
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,320
50

2003
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,624
1

2004
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:35,520
$3,000

2005
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:50,880
Right up until the point

2006
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:54,208
Berkeley

2007
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:57,792
Check 83094

2008
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:58,816
Cancel

2009
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,608
And that was a mess

2010
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,144
That was a mess

2011
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:09,824
Suggestion is because he doesn't want him to work there anymore

2012
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:14,176
We got the first suggestion which is charged the media thousand dollars to go on their shows which

2013
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,456
She's probably too late for that

2014
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:17,504
Probably

2015
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:25,952
If you had a website you could just sell oil paintings and get paid to make statements

2016
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:35,424
I could come up with 50 different things for you to do

2017
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:40,800
So you wouldn't listen to any of them listen to me say you should sell oil painting

2018
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:41,568
With your

2019
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,224
Stupid response that I'm not an artist

2020
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,040
Social media influencer

2021
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:53,600
Holy created by millennials

2022
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:55,648
So

2023
01:59:56,160 --> 02:00:02,304
Yeah okay that's right

2024
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,376
Beautiful

2025
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:08,448
Time traveling Powerline

2026
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:15,872
I don't think it's someone being not willing to do it and put in effort when you say you should do something you can't do

2027
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:18,944
Did they say

2028
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:24,064
I think that would be scamming people by selling them

2029
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:29,696
The con

2030
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:36,096
You know how you don't make things

2031
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,912
Yeah now that you're famous people want those things

2032
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:40,192
And you can just sell it

2033
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:59,648
Open communication earlier in the day about giving him a job

2034
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:04,512
You know how lame this guy would be around

2035
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:07,072
Hey Rob do like to sexually harass people

2036
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:07,840
It's fun

2037
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:11,680
No one complains except for that time that I accidentally hired a black girl

2038
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:15,008
Then I'm going to hire a disc

2039
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,056
Kill

2040
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:23,456
My dad is going to have to deal with HR complaints without on a boat is not even at the office ever

2041
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,992
What are we going to do

2042
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:26,272
He's a pissed-off mood like

2043
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,040
Used LOL

2044
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:33,184
What was he was he thinking about

2045
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:36,768
Hey Jorge whe was a war criminal

2046
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,376
The next

2047
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,168
Alex asked

2048
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:44,448
For his final thoughts

2049
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,520
And this is where I think Mike thinks he already has

2050
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,544
Okay

2051
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,688
It demeans

2052
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,808
Doing with each other in working together for

2053
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:04,672
Taking steps

2054
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,024
Forgetting yours going up the steps

2055
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,352
Stefan the second step

2056
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:22,080
I get it which is

2057
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,248
Out the f****** door

2058
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:30,784
Jordan

2059
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,320
We've hit the last clip

2060
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,088
Yeah

2061
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,416
I apologize in advance

2062
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,696
This is 5 minutes long

2063
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:42,304
You got to give me a high sign when you want me to posit or something like that

2064
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,584
Is two men

2065
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,352
Having

2066
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,400
Conversation with each other

2067
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:49,216
Neither of them understand what the other is saying

2068
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:51,264
What is in a high-status position

2069
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,544
In this case is Alex

2070
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,848
It doesn't want to put up with the other guy's bulshit

2071
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:57,664
God dammit this is so crazy

2072
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,688
And also rest

2073
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,224
Okay

2074
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:06,112
Labrador retriever German Shepherd mix and match when I was busted years old

2075
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:08,160
Highway

2076
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:12,000
The sweet dog every time we try to go

2077
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,008
Eyebrows like timers old

2078
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,056
Pictures old man

2079
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,200
Heart attack

2080
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,576
It was murder

2081
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,624
We thought the point

2082
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:42,208
Everytime I turn the volume up my truck or my dad's Land Cruiser

2083
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,256
He will get scared

2084
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:48,096
Put ya

2085
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,912
Promise

2086
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,704
So real quick

2087
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,472
Just because

2088
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,520
It's very obvious

2089
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,824
What he's talking about

2090
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,360
Superjeweler that

2091
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:05,760
Lord I'm trying to help you

2092
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:10,368
Call you dog

2093
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,696
He couldn't get over that trauma

2094
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:15,232
I never beat the dog

2095
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
I love that dog

2096
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,048
I buried that. Myself

2097
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,352
Childhood

2098
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,656
But he couldn't pass the drama

2099
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:24,704
He couldn't trust me to get in the car

2100
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,544
Feeling this about Mike

2101
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:30,336
What are you talkin about himself

2102
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,640
There is no doubt in my mind

2103
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,992
It is

2104
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:40,320
Using Mike as a surrogate to get it out

2105
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,600
And deal with it

2106
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,928
Hated that

2107
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,464
I have been hurt

2108
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:51,072
I have pain from the past that I'm unable to get over

2109
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,352
Putting that on Mike

2110
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,632
Very clearly because my

2111
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:56,448
Hasn't said anything to indicate any of this

2112
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:00,800
I was whoever it was got to be 5.7

2113
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,944
My I grew up with a

2114
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:10,784
And shoot my friend for years

2115
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,576
And I remind

2116
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:16,160
We're just different.

2117
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:16,928
Video

2118
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:22,048
Came into my bedroom one day and

2119
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:29,472
He brought her to the pound and there's enough

2120
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:32,032
Will he was asleep

2121
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:33,824
Really

2122
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:40,736
What

2123
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,872
Real quick

2124
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:13,248
The day before on the early on the show Alex said that his mom kicked him out of the house

2125
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:16,576
Because he was dating a woman who like to yell at his mom

2126
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:21,184
So the idea that his dog died and you realize that it's time to get out of the house child

2127
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,488
That doesn't match

2128
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,280
An hour earlier

2129
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,560
Also

2130
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:28,096
This dog story

2131
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,632
Competition

2132
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:35,264
Surround

2133
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,032
11

2134
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,848
I don't want to hear it and then later it died

2135
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,408
From this

2136
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:45,504
From this point forward to conversations that are happening

2137
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:50,880
Very easy

2138
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:55,744
You don't want to go along with me trying to help you

2139
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,536
Now trying to be like

2140
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:01,120
Why did you take my dad thought I couldn't handle that

2141
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:06,752
The flavor for the next couple minutes

2142
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:12,640
Is that

2143
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:15,456
People get trauma and drama

2144
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:18,784
Because the dog

2145
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,320
The dog

2146
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:24,672
Pissed itself

2147
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:27,744
Even though we took it on

2148
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,120
This is

2149
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:42,080
The beginning of the clip he said I don't want to call you a dog

2150
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,104
I'm about to

2151
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:48,480
Give a metaphor and allegory

2152
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,576
What is it you're speculating that

2153
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,600
Father.

2154
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:06,144
How you where you're getting information

2155
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:12,544
That particular people was good.

2156
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:19,200
It was traumatizing

2157
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:22,784
14

2158
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:25,856
Not go to the vet

2159
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:45,568
Bright

2160
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,200
Mama horse

2161
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:58,880
That was always different

2162
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,416
Like a dog

2163
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,696
The story is about

2164
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,464
Walk the dog

2165
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:07,328
Traumatized

2166
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:10,400
Time to pick it up on

2167
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,800
Because of whoever it was taken away from

2168
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:21,152
But every time I took it somewhere

2169
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:22,688
Metaphysical

2170
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:25,248
The prowl the dogs

2171
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,768
You are

2172
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:40,608
Patient zero

2173
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:56,736
I figured the same thing over and over again

2174
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:58,528
It's a whole new world

2175
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:06,720
Will talk to you soon

2176
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:13,632
John Doe

2177
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,216
Lesbian

2178
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:19,776
That's the f****** bad end

2179
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,568
That's awful

2180
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:25,408
Maybe we should have said this at the beginning

2181
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:31,552
What is occurring in that Dynamic there was

2182
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:32,832
Him

2183
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:34,624
Almost

2184
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,160
Existing within the

2185
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,440
Trauma that Alex

2186
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:40,000
Saying that the dog was in

2187
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:42,560
Like Mike sitting there going like

2188
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:49,984
So you're saying that my father didn't think I was emotionally strong enough

2189
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:56,384
Did you get that information

2190
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,408
About this in advance

2191
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:04,576
Right there looking for

2192
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,856
The Smoking Gun

2193
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,392
Alex Jones

2194
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:10,464
Is Iraq

2195
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:12,512
I'm saying something

2196
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:20,192
Welt.de traumatized and now is an incapable of moving beyond

2197
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:26,592
While at the same time the traumatized

2198
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:31,968
Moving on past the traumas that he's looking at two separate pieces

2199
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,088
I do not understand

2200
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,368
One word

2201
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:39,136
Tracking

2202
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:42,976
This conversation that Alex is having with him about

2203
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:49,376
The inability to get over the trauma is what made the dog piss on him and not be able to go along with stuff

2204
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:50,656
Rotondo is Mike

2205
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:51,680
Where to

2206
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:56,800
He latched onto Alex thought you were too weak

2207
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:58,592
That could fill the gap of

2208
02:11:58,848 --> 02:12:00,640
Explaining

2209
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:07,040
Metaphorical getting thrown out of a car was and that's why he as opposed to

2210
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:08,320
With just being like

2211
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,112
About

2212
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:13,184
Yeah that makes a lot more sense that makes that makes

2213
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:16,512
Dual conversations not as

2214
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,280
Curious

2215
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:19,584
And I mean if I were in his shoes

2216
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:21,376
And someone knows not

2217
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,680
Has Alex pretty quirky

2218
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,984
I would still be like

2219
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:27,776
What's your problem

2220
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:29,568
Why did you say that to me

2221
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,152
Hope the interview

2222
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:36,480
Himself gives the Freudian slip whenever he's like

2223
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:42,368
You're you're you're also the Alex

2224
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:45,952
You are a broken person

2225
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:49,280
And you're not good at you're trying to fix

2226
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:54,400
6u time you're trying to push you away

2227
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:59,520
Disneyland

2228
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:04,384
Play

2229
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:06,176
You would watches me like

2230
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,456
The dumbest f******

2231
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:08,480
And s*** I've ever heard

2232
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:13,856
The dumbest f****** s*** I've ever heard before my life

2233
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:18,464
Yeah but especially because it's like we cover the Infowars world there's only like

2234
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:21,280
Six varieties of episodes or things

2235
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:25,376
And usually happen

2236
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:28,192
Cool boy alex trying to

2237
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:33,312
To fix himself through Daddy's interesting late motif

2238
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:44,320
But the idea that we're doing a show about

2239
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,856
A crazy person

2240
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:48,160
You fixed his own life

2241
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:52,768
Probably trying to distract from the fact like

2242
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:55,840
He's not going to prison but he's got to be worried that like

2243
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:57,120
I got answers

2244
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:58,144
Question

2245
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:01,472
Like there's going to be a come-to-jesus moment whether I like it or not

2246
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:04,032
He's probably pretty stressed out about that

2247
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:10,432
Now I want I want to say that I tried to jump into this right at the end

2248
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,200
Episode

2249
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,736
F*** us for not kind of

2250
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,088
Michael Rotondo is someone

2251
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:18,112
Who has

2252
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:19,392
History

2253
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,672
Westside

2254
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:21,440
Him

2255
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:22,720
Stocking a lady

2256
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,744
Now

2257
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:29,120
I don't know enough of the details of that to save it maybe his mental illness

2258
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:30,144
Contributed to that

2259
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,936
Most likely probably did

2260
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:35,008
Excuse the behavior

2261
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:38,592
What is

2262
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,640
The reason that this is funny

2263
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:43,968
And the reason we're laughing at it is not because Mike

2264
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:48,576
Whatever mental illness he has

2265
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:50,112
We're laughing

2266
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:54,208
Because of Alex's stupidity and complete obliviousness

2267
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:55,232
Do the situation

2268
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:58,304
Every complete

2269
02:14:58,816 --> 02:14:59,840
That's what's funny

2270
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:01,376
It's not laughing at Mike

2271
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:02,400
Although

2272
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:04,192
Certainly not letting him off the hook

2273
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,056
Like this reminds you so much

2274
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:11,616
70s movies

2275
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:18,272
Where the kid is growing up in the seventies and his dad was a raised in the fifties and he's doing the whole distance

2276
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,296
Parenting thing

2277
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,856
Getting drunk and yelling at this kid

2278
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:28,256
Not able to understand why he likes the rock music or whatever why it was Italian

2279
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,680
Use the whole f****** thing

2280
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:38,496
Breaking away

2281
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:41,312
But there's no

2282
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:47,200
At the same time there's no third act where the dad comes around and realizes for my Sunday doesn't work

2283
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,736
Do stuff but he's really cool

2284
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:50,272
Or whatever you know

2285
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:54,880
Bike race

2286
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:56,672
None of that

2287
02:15:56,928 --> 02:16:03,072
No grown men with daddy issues being daddy issue Daddy

2288
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:06,400
Each other difficult troubling part is that like

2289
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,424
You do some

2290
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,960
Sometimes as you listen to this

2291
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:10,496
Forget like that's a thirty-year-old

2292
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:12,288
Yeah I know right

2293
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:20,992
Was being done completely differently

2294
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:23,040
I think it might be able to handle himself

2295
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:23,808
Quite Pizza

2296
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:30,208
Like you made a couple points that were counter two things that Alex believe

2297
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:32,000
The last episode when he said

2298
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:35,328
I don't think that it's great to have people not having food

2299
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:40,704
Right trying to raise taxes

2300
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:41,984
Going to get rid of crime

2301
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:51,968
Do the 5G isn't really that scary

2302
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,040
Like he's not

2303
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:57,088
1588

2304
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:03,744
Idiots out there a word he's unable to understand what's appropriate to a certain degree

2305
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,024
But I don't know if it's

2306
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,560
To a clinical level

2307
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:08,608
Stupid if someone wasn't

2308
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:10,144
Screaming at him right

2309
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:11,424
Complete brat

2310
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,960
I'm trying to be like

2311
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:19,616
My pills with fruit giving a confession to all that bull

2312
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:21,408
If it wasn't for 5

2313
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:24,224
Street hours

2314
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:28,576
Yeah if Alex was there

2315
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:32,672
You said it was a good idea or whatever it is

2316
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:34,464
It still might have done it

2317
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:38,816
Injustice it look

2318
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:43,424
Do you know what 5 years coming through gives a s*** about the justice

2319
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:45,216
5G stands for 5 jump

2320
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,312
There's

2321
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:52,128
This brings us to

2322
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:53,920
BBQ back to even

2323
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:58,016
Ivar Michael Rotondo Saga

2324
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:58,784
Unless

2325
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:03,648
3 weeks from now

2326
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:06,720
To do it I feel like we don't I think we got to the phone no

2327
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:12,864
It's not about him

2328
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,912
What kind of headspace

2329
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:17,472
And so are we wish everyone

2330
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:24,384
Reconcile with your father's actually Alex does say that

2331
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:30,528
In the section where he's talking about how like

2332
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:33,088
Genetically it's a power line goes down

2333
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:35,392
He's like whatever your dad did you just going right

2334
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:37,696
Zion Pelicans

2335
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:39,488
Thank you for being late

2336
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:42,816
You don't know what is that I don't know either but like

2337
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:49,728
You know where bucilla I don't I don't want no part of that.

2338
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:51,264
Episode

2339
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,312
This is only funny because Alex

2340
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,080
Yeah absolutely

2341
02:18:54,592 --> 02:19:00,736
Website.com

2342
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:02,272
Right now it's not

2343
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:04,832
Becomes apparent

2344
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:07,392
It will be and I will have to race memory

2345
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:08,928
The parrot

2346
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:14,048
A white background so we're good, great

2347
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,352
There's a lot of fun stuff to enjoy on there

2348
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:25,568
Flow

2349
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:27,360
We're on Facebook

2350
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:37,088
Beerland

2351
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:41,440
Okay

2352
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:43,488
The show is starting at 10

2353
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:45,792
Do you have

2354
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:48,864
I'm cool with it

2355
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:52,192
I'm just hoping anybody shows

2356
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:55,776
Night okay

2357
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:01,920
I believe it's you

2358
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:03,200
I guess it is

2359
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:08,832
Well the really the only choice he certainly not going to tell Mike rotundo to f*** himself

2360
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:13,952
Alex is a bad choice I will go with Reverend Brown

2361
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:23,424
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
