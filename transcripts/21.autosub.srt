1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,960
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

3
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
Have a conversation

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,992
What's the

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
My friend

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,600
Is that I know a lot about Infowars and Alex Jones in

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,392
In particular

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,184
And therein lies the rub

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,744
Where's the fun of this show

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Back

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
The red wine

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Cuz I pointed out that's what I

13
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
Jones is

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
Is the actual Manufacturing

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
Is the name of the gnarly head

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
He puts his head in

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Scrapes

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,200
Using the weight of his head he squeezes it down

19
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
That's why all the time

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,576
Too much grape acidity

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,392
Inside a little piece of the grape skin out

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,232
If you're going to be covering

23
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
B Thursday March

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,328
9th episode of The Alex Jones Show

25
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,400
We're going to

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,960
The ups and downs the whirligigs and all that

27
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
But first

28
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
I'd like to give a couple of

29
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Shoutouts

30
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
You will not be cover

31
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
Alright from the Thursday episode

32
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
It ended with the

33
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
Special Report from Batman

34
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
Creeper to the shadow

35
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Because

36
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
First of all

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
We were texting about the

38
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
On Thursday

39
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Those like I think

40
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Talk about

41
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
That I realized

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Only

43
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
Flight 1

44
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
He might talk

45
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
Possibly

46
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
Also he still has not put up that picture

47
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
Still the picture is still on the the ground and his man cave I was hoping that I would turn it on

48
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
The picture will be up at

49
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
He definitely listen

50
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Eva is

51
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
The pictures

52
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
Like are we doing a reverse

53
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Dorian Gray gets older and the picture gets younger nobody

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Haircut

55
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760
It's unfortunate because him with really short hair

56
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,320
Makes it clear like how crazy Muppet

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,696
Google Eid Natok

58
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
Ridiculous

59
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Pretty pretty long-ass

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Pretty long.

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
Celebrity looks like short hair

62
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Yeah

63
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
His report is all about

64
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Vaccine

65
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
And we don't need to go into

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,712
We will actually have to go into it because that is now the predominant narrative

67
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,552
On Alex's show

68
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,904
They're terrible

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,024
Diseases and we need to have those otherwise

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Another pharmaceutical company

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
I won't make the money

72
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
Slightly different than his

73
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Well

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Need to listen to this show

75
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,408
Rapport needs Elizabeth put up a picture of a shout-out to Portugal man

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,504
Never heard of that Alex is furious

77
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
American Girl music video

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
Show themselves burning a copy of an Infowars newspaper

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
That's pretty great Alex

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,216
Amanda looks like

81
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Was he wearing a hat okay well that's all I needed to know whether or not

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Wear a hat

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,808
Yeah and he's like all the Indians know I'm awesome be in the streets

84
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Thank me

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh man

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
I'm assuming if you did go to India he would be

87
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Absolutely

88
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
This is something that needs to be pointed out in the last

89
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
The f****** Overdrive

90
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,751
Okay almost everyday is putting out like our lungs

91
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,055
Specials after the episode

92
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
He's putting out late night with Alex

93
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,719
Like FDR's Fireside Chats if Ser were a raving f****** lunatic and also

94
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,143
DJ diesel

95
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,959
Before he was doing Monday through

96
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Friday

97
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
The three hours

98
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,567
The first three hours of the show and then he put out

99
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,383
The special two hours Sunday show every week

100
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
This week

101
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
He put out a Saturday

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,039
And I wanted to go over to miss episode but

103
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
It's not f****** worth it

104
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
It's okay

105
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
But it goes back to what I'm telling you about the vaccine

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
So we're just we're just all on the vaccine

107
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
Is going on currently

108
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
But vaccine

109
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,167
It's too much news to cover but it's not news and it's nothing

110
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Right it's like I listen

111
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Then

112
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
I need start

113
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
I like

114
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Hockley showing

115
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Hey

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
IMDb

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
This is what specific theories cuz he does go into his

118
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,975
He's just like a insert from a vaccine music

119
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,327
It says it will give you diabetes

120
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,751
I pulled up the insert and I read it and it's like it just has a laundry list of side effects

121
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
Theoretically

122
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
It is

123
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,223
More research into you find that it's basically that's

124
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
A catch-all

125
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Kind of thing

126
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
But there was a discredited

127
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Study from

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
Sixties Okay so

129
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
It doesn't actually give you diabetes because that doesn't make a goddamn liquor

130
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
Be safe they put on there

131
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Give you diabetes

132
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Great my understand

133
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
Fantastic

134
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
Indicate

135
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Of course

136
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
That's not even have diabetes

137
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Work

138
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Nope

139
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Does Alex know what

140
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
I think he has the broad Strokes

141
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
It has to do with sugar

142
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
I think that's

143
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Where he's at

144
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
He's afraid of it so he has

145
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Filled with insulin

146
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
In case he gets it

147
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
There's always doesn't look like

148
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
He's just going

149
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
Buckwild on this

150
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
I get it

151
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
You got to be afraid of something

152
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
A lot of the news that he's pitching is stale and there's

153
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
But it's looking real bad for

154
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:36,191
Looking real bad for a lot of these dudes rogerstone probably in trouble

155
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Jones are

156
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
The best friend

157
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,871
Yeah that's I don't know if we can hang out

158
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Finally look up

159
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
The the

160
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Tattoos

161
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
Send Rodger Stone has been

162
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
And wow

163
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Do you know what his

164
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Quote on it is

165
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
I don't remember

166
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
He has this line he uses

167
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
To pick up girls

168
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,047
The only guy with a dick in front

169
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Dick on back

170
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
Jesus yeah right

171
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495
Classy guy left legs

172
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
To spontaneously

173
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
Is the pressure

174
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
To keep Rising on

175
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
So he blows

176
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Himself up

177
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,759
Call man

178
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Keeps on

179
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Angry

180
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Angry

181
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Racist

182
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Horrible person

183
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Under under extreme

184
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Stress

185
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
Maybe he blows his brains out well no I mean

186
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,631
Just recently under all this stress he ended up accidentally admitting

187
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:44,031
To WikiLeaks

188
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,879
So you're member whenever Hillary and Bill had that didn't they kill a guy that that Garden

189
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Vince Foster

190
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
But

191
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Rodger Stone

192
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,911
How many great books are going to read about how Trump and Putin assassinated

193
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,383
Broomall in the pot mix it up and we got some great conspiracy theory we got globalist

194
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Episode today is a little bit all over the place I'll be honest

195
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,903
A lot of things that are sort of

196
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
A little bit

Beautiful woman before she was soft killed by the globalist

218
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375

219
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,311
Talking Alex you're getting control myself

220
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,223
When he said that I could not have been more excited

221
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
Alex getting so mad

222
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551

Emotions are a

226
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,351

You know I'm pissed off

230
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,295
Because it's so ridiculously obvious

231
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,367
Demonic

232
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439

Which is

377
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Brilliant

378
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319

382
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Not

00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
All of the years

Developing a healthcare plan to compete with Obamacare

386
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
They did

387
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Yaldabaoth

388
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,431
Is Bill with a photocopier

389
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
Here's some thoughts

390
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
SNL's probably done like a

391
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Right

392
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,376
I split them in half and they just argue with each other

393
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
You're right

394
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
And then

395
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Power presentation

396
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,584
V

397
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:14,016
Sociopath

398
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:24,256
If we could harness just for one second

399
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Like

400
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
We used him

401
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,192
That is exactly what I want to go on TV and say

402
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,080
I don't know I feel I feel like the blowback from yelling like that is pretty

403
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,200
Credit

404
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
He needs to

405
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,064
F****** sacrificed himself so that all of us can live

406
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
I don't I don't really disagree with that

407
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,976
Mad about you

408
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,048
This keeps coming back to this team that Alex has it

409
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Projection

410
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Will you put it on people

411
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Feel like

412
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
You know you what your alt are you faking election rules lisping and you read one of these books I've read them all you think you're better than me

413
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,384
Paul Ryan

414
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:19,040
Rockingham and ignore

415
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,416
Petro

416
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,696
Is it people who act

417
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,488
Can we listen and engaged

418
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
You talkin about

419
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
Dirty

420
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
Absolutely

421
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,824
I do like how he really like

422
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Couple of times

423
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
He was really close to saying

424
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
This isn't better than Obamacare

425
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
He just

426
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Can't do it

427
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
Bring himself to say

428
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
They

429
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,904
Thought of a plan that is even worse than the garbage plan we hate

430
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,024
Did slip and say it would be like outside of his philosophy

431
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,120
Cuz if he said it's worse than Obamacare you could easily cover that and be like

432
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
I expect more

433
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,752
Who's going to be

434
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
This is worse

435
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
It is worth

436
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
You gone too far

437
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,184
I will try to come up with an Alex Jones

438
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,024
Metaphor which is the concern

439
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,120
The rest of the clip is where Alex says one of his big thing

440
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,728
Which is claimed that someone who disagrees with is an enemy of

441
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
Comment

442
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,576
Toronto Congress

443
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
He's a bigger enemy

444
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Hillary Clinton he is the enemy of the American people

445
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Call Ryan

446
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Eddie Munster

447
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
Anatomy of the American people

448
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
I don't want you to say that cuz I don't like that phrase

449
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
I really think the enemy of the people

450
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,592
And stuff like that is a really dangerous thing to do

451
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,896
It's very much

452
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Dictators do

453
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
But also

454
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,576
If you're doing something that is going to lead to the deaths of

455
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
Thousands upon thousands upon

456
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,952
Doesn't feel like you were an enemy of those people

457
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
I think you wanted

458
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,328
Look on was never on the people side

459
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
He was on something that you can express

460
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Using that verb

461
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,384
I know it's a fine point to make but I think that in the same way that when Trump says

462
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,224
Fake media is enemy of the people

463
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,856
This place where it's really extreme other I don't like that

464
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:08,256
Fake media is not the enemy that people because fake media is not murdering thousands

465
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
What Paul Ryan is doing

466
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
Make no mistake

467
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
Is murder

468
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Gentlemen I do believe

469
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
That it is 100% murder

470
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
We can agree

471
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Upon thousands

472
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
The people that died

473
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
For Taxco

474
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
We can't agree on the substance

475
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,504
Agree to disagree on the language

476
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
But I think the more important thing that I want to bring up

477
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
Is that Alex Jones

478
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Always

479
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
Talks about how

480
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
People call other people racist

481
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
In a manipulative trick to gain power over them

482
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,840
And then he calls people the enemy of America

483
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
People

484
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
In order to gain power

485
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Point out that apocracy

486
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,288
I think it's probably more important than my little

487
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,848
Quibble about I don't like spinach

488
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,640
I don't like that

489
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
That Yusuf

490
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,040
Anime eyes in people is really bad

491
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:07,904
Another

492
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
Or he protects his own blog

493
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Is Avenues

494
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:18,400
Get to the internet

495
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Killswitch

496
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,568
Infowars.com

497
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,688
The show

498
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,832
He's like it's in the news

499
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
You don't store say anything

500
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,952
There have been repeated instances of people sending you

501
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
Prank messages

502
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,816
That you end up reporting as the news which is fantastic

503
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Paul Joseph Watson

504
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,056
VMware open itself or multiple

505
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
Damn thing

506
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
It ruined all of your credibility

507
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,712
So when you're reporting something and no one else is there's a reason

508
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
It's because you

509
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Don't

510
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Have journalistic

511
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
You don't have an editorial process

512
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
So you just put up

513
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
Well I mean

514
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
It is something that's repeatedly source

515
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
From his sources

516
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Or from themselves

517
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
Who have never revealed themselves

518
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Ever

519
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
I guess

520
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Dr. Steve pieczenik

521
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,896
And Jesse James

522
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Who is adopted

523
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,736
Who may or may not be.

524
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
I believe that

525
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
Next clip

526
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
Let's see what we got going

527
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Just a nice fear tactic

528
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
Pics about liberalism

529
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
To get islamophobia

530
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
Misogyny

531
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,800
The last maybe 45 seconds

532
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,408
Hateable way

533
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
Understudies

534
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,416
I hate yourself

535
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
I don't hate you

536
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
So that's not how anything

537
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
That's incredibly stupid

538
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
I don't think anybody is

539
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
Recruiting people

540
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Nurturing

541
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
Feelings that already exist

542
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Send some people

543
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Or making it okay

544
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
Pretty before already

545
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
Brands at a very young age

546
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
Not feel like they're f****** weirdo

547
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Also

548
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Hey

549
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,544
Let's take a step back

550
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
Well I think

551
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
We all know

552
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,920
Women go through the change of life

553
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:21,440
You're no longer a woman that's what we're not that's a No-No absolutely

554
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,792
Oregon

555
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Take it out

556
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
It's absurd

557
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
To say that that is the root of

558
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
What's

559
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Being a woman is

560
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
It's

561
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,360
More or turning women into baby Factory

562
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Supposed to people

563
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
That's true

564
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
That's what is ultimately kind of

565
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,272
It is not that women have any age

566
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
Empty at all on their own

567
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Baby Phat

568
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Is there there

569
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
To push out kids

570
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
And be quiet

571
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
Things lost in the shuffle but I also don't think that

572
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
Women's studies classes

573
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,800
Text Manda hate yourself and roll over to Gizmo

574
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
Now we're going to

575
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,064
Stop drop and roll anytime in Islamic man walks

576
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,440
To the Rogue 101 is that like

577
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
Just feminist Theory

578
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Georgia O'Keeffe

579
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,656
Paintings what-have-you

580
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,616
Second-level is

581
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,688
Just be cool with Muslims cutting off your clitoris

582
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
That's Victaulic programs as a dumb idea

583
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,024
But you're much like Alex going to take what I'm saying and contact

584
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Any of that

585
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:09,472
Our national pulling clips from our own making fun of our cell

586
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:15,872
Bottle episode

587
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Is that

588
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
He's never really been to college

589
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
So

590
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
He's never been to college he went

591
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
Two junior college for a little bit and dropped out

592
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,880
Experience what real colleges are like

593
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
He's never

594
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,744
Avenue kids are old enough to be in college at this point

595
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
I don't think he has any real world

596
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
Experience with what

597
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
Campuses are you just read

598
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,448
It's pure propaganda liberalism taking over colleges

599
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,288
He clearly doesn't read articles that he talks about do you just seems like

600
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
Campus activism and he thinks that

601
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Is Terrorism

602
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
It's it's

603
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Completely insane

604
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:55,808
You know that's living in a bubble you you actually do make a really

605
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
A really good point

606
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
Even though he lives in Austin

607
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
Beer

608
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
Multiple college campuses

609
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,816
The only way he get that information

610
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
Is through that

611
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
Fart Town

612
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,800
Yeah that kind of propaganda

613
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
I bet

614
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Breitbart

615
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,712
Right

616
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Listen to the world and it's

617
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Tragically flawed

618
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,832
Yeah they do window he's looking out

619
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
Is covered in dirt

620
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,416
And he doesn't realize he's not getting of you of

621
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
The landscape

622
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,816
Instead of white

623
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
White wine suck

624
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
Speaking about Focus Alex Jones has laser focus

625
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
Alright

626
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,408
Wants to take down f****** Bill Gates

627
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
Cuz he's a eugenicist

628
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Okay

629
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
Evil and wants to

630
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
To kill all the third world populations

631
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
That is

632
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,672
That's a super villain

633
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Absolutely

634
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
What is fascinating

635
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,472
Back when I used to be a little bit more Craigslist

636
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
Eye exam using that

637
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,992
I didn't believe them but I was one of my big reasons for it is like

638
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,064
What I'm doing is essentially making the world more interesting

639
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,672
Cuz I don't really believe this but I entertained the premise as a possibility

640
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,512
Then if you know it's not that I'm just going to work everyday living my life

641
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Yeah

642
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
There's a

643
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,864
A hidden enemy behind every door

644
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,264
A superhero movie narrative go on behind the scenes

645
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
When you're seven anywhere like you know what

646
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm actually at

647
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
Secret Ninja

648
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
And I'm just waiting

649
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,152
For the opportunity to show my

650
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,992
That was Alex

651
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
And I like the movie Surf Ninja

652
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
Really love the movie surf

653
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,952
It's not a good movie

654
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,256
It's one of Leslie Nielsen's last movies

655
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Who was great

656
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
I bet his act. Sort of stale

657
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,848
I do want to save it like coming out the other end of that sort of dabbling into

658
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Conspiracies

659
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,664
I'm much more comfortable now

660
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
That I was that

661
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,272
It is interesting to me how

662
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
That is the

663
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,368
A sensible idea behind it is that you're making

664
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
The WorldMark

665
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
To me that is

666
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
Fake order

667
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Is more interesting

668
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
Because

669
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
The world is in Memphis

670
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,240
Just saying if you just see how none of it makes any goddamn sense

671
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Instead of

672
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
Instead of being you know

673
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,688
Adam Radioactive

674
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Epitope exploding all over the

675
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:11,136
You hit the nail on the head is more comfortable then

676
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
Except

677
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Cons of chaotic and

678
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
These in the world that all have their own interest

679
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,656
And the rubbing into each other over and over again

680
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
But it

681
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Some

682
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,568
Crazy crypto group

683
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
That is pulling all the strings

684
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
More

685
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,480
It's somehow more comforting to think that there's an alien

686
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Civilization that can

687
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
Can shoot an asteroid at

688
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,672
Time for no reason with nobody

689
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
The world just might explode because that's how asteroid

690
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
Yeah like

691
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Maybe one of them

692
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
I'm just lands on Earth

693
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,008
There's no Rhyme or Reason for it that's just the universe we live in

694
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Instead of

695
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
There's always somebody app

696
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
What rejecting

697
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,664
Chaos and Randomness gives you a sense

698
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
The power

699
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,248
In some ways because at least

700
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
Everything that happens isn't

701
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,600
Adjust the Victor will

702
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Complete coincidence

703
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,000
It gives you some sense of power over your own destiny

704
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
But then on top of that.

705
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
These particular version that Alex cell

706
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
Like with the globalist and with all this

707
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
Worldwide

708
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
Con job that's going on

709
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
It's a sense of

710
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Having some

711
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Power button

712
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Within

713
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Powerless

714
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
So it's

715
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
Of everybody else

716
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Yet at least

717
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,320
You're aware that everybody else is at

718
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,136
Are you get to yell at everyone else

719
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
You stupid

720
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,256
Michaela

721
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
It's incredibly sad

722
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
But I

723
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
Bill Gates trying to kill us

724
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Cept

725
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,080
AI

726
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,920
Ferrari overpowering

727
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
Resistant or becoming immune to it

728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,560
Publix level resistance

729
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,472
Because the ones in charge are so cowardly so wicked so evil

730
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,544
I understand there's a good chance they're going to lose

731
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,664
Emergency escape ships

732
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,480
Underground bunkers I mean big facility

733
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Yeah you are that's how I would do it

734
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
With a bunch of demons

735
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Hell no

736
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,336
So yeah that's

737
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
That's fun

738
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
What are you got there what do you want

739
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,248
Did you take her already overcoming Nai

740
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,696
He thinks AI has already reached the top and

741
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:04,096
Or are you

742
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,888
Haley Joel Osment

743
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,936
Coward in the globalist

744
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,520
Or or resistant to diseases

745
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
Does he think that

746
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,640
Diseases disappeared not vaccine

747
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:21,504
We're all just immune to smallpox weird nootropics

748
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
City sales

749
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
As we all know smallpox

750
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
A hundred percent

751
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
I bet she said that word for word

752
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,360
Totally Alex is really good at quota table

753
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
Nope

754
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
She said

755
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Was essentially

756
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
That all of these people who are spreading these can

757
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
Conspiracies

758
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,600
All this negative

759
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
The end the fact of it is

760
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
People dying

761
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,232
Because it's a lot of if enough people

762
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
Get on this anti-vax

763
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Train

764
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
And outlaws

765
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
Populations will die

766
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,032
Ancient diseases back to our modern-day

767
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,360
You guys remember how all your friends didn't

768
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Smallpox

769
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,944
Yeah another

770
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,552
So that's what I'm saying is real consequences

771
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,440
Yeah it's also kind of a threat

772
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
Right

773
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
She's pointing up

774
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,608
This is a threat you're threatening

775
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Human Bean

776
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936
More like she telling you you're the threat

777
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,496
As opposed to she is to you

778
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
So it's wildly

779
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,128
Open why would that threat make any sense

780
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Talking

781
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,759
A lot of you will die

782
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
Why is that

783
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
How does that make sense

784
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
As a threat to him

785
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
Shut your mouth

786
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,231
Conspiracy theorist is it

787
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
They're going to

788
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Cast

789
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,399
But isn't that the whole thing that he's saying they're going to do anyways

790
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,215
I don't know

791
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,103
Don't stop talking about the vaccines were going to give you a b******

792
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:29,503
Melinda Gates

793
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
Yeah

794
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
Turn on wetwork about Melinda Gates

795
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Wetworks

796
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,255
Super female vitality

797
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
What

798
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:50,751
It's like the premise that Bill Gates wants to kill people off with vaccines

799
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
Is flawed

800
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Crema just

801
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,455
The premise it has it has some good

802
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:04,575
It's one of those another episode I just don't think we have the

803
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
To do it today

804
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
I do think

805
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
Critique of him

806
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
Is built on the craziest found

807
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:19,935
Can I get into that but someday is wrong is a lot of other

808
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
It is

809
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,495
You know whatever

810
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
Since we are paid by Soros

811
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,847
He did tell us to go after other billion

812
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
Right

813
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Gave us our marching

814
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:36,831
Define Don, we will we will

815
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,879
Just indicate the show at no cost

816
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,999
Website

817
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,023
Not a good deal

818
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
But

819
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,143
Idzik in terms of the theories that he has

820
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
There are ones

821
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
I don't know how you came up with

822
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
And those ones are like

823
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,823
I can see what you're misinterpreting

824
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,639
I'm saying that this Bill Gates one is that

825
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
Catch I can see why

826
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
You are

827
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
Misunderstanding this

828
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Not like

829
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,855
Is holcroft

830
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
He has to know that he's

831
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Misrepresent

832
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,703
This comes back to another like one of our arguments

833
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:30,591
I think my feelings on it is a lot of the time you have

834
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
If you are a complete

835
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Gutter repair

836
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
You could

837
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
Interpret

838
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
I could definitely see that

839
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
Because here's the thing that he is always

840
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
Talking about

841
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
They exist

842
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,791
Exactly you're always talking

843
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:54,143
Melinda Gates speech is not too

844
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
It's to Alex Jones

845
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,775
Yeah when she says anything that involves

846
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
And then a closet

847
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
No consequences

848
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
The consequences are always

849
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,295
Drawn to him directly to Alex

850
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,599
Directly to that man

851
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
So I can see him not like

852
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Purposely

853
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,231
It's possible

854
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,023
Oh well who cares

855
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,215
Alex Jones is really only interested in talking about you know

856
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
Therapist

857
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:36,895
No that's not the case he also wants to talk about pop culture celebrity women

858
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
That's always a good

859
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,295
Here's the part of the show where Alex Jones

860
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,831
Trucks a little bit

861
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:50,719
Out-of-school maybe a little bit I don't know

862
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
It is about our old friend

863
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Katy Perry

864
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,167
Non go to war with Katy Perry

865
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,983
Witchcraft

866
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
I just thought

867
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,431
Ancient Battlefield with nuns

868
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:15,039
Carrying Shields and swords and Katy Perry dressed as a valkyrie from

869
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,343
Whatever dumb videos just standing there

870
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,743
Katy Perry vs. nuns

871
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,863
No she wanted to buy like an old nunnery

872
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,703
I like this is not a worry in LA

873
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Because of

874
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
Some of her

875
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
Dubious religious

876
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
They don't want to sell it to her

877
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,455
There's a conflict going on about that

878
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
So just like a property 2

879
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Basically

880
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,951
I don't know I don't know all the details

881
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,047
One final dance off

882
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:04,447
In order to pay off

883
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,519
A Golden Globe

884
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,335
I don't

885
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:15,455
I don't know if they still live there or if it's owned by the Archdiocese

886
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
B u b b

887
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
From them

888
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,343
End of the conflict about it because it

889
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
In the past

890
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:27,231
She has an interview years ago where she said that you wanted to be a Christian artist

891
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,839
I initially when she was younger but there's no it wasn't marketable at you couldn't be

892
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Successful

893
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
Hey so she said she went to pop music

894
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
If you freeze it is selling her soul to the devil

895
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Which is

896
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
Sort of a creative flourish

897
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
Yeah

898
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,871
But people take meth

899
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
Seems like

900
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
She just said

901
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
That she wanted

902
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
Christian nonsense

903
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
As a good business

904
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
Decision

905
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
She didn't

906
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
Yeah so that's why they're not telling her no

907
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,351
But she actually sold her soul to the devil

908
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,167
1930s Blues

909
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
No

910
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,359
No

911
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,175
No one has lost their head in any of her songs

912
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,479
I still really like you right now

913
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,599
Nobody's had their head cut off by train girls I like most

914
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,391
Slipper socks

915
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
I think a more accurate

916
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
I can see why you want her to buy the

917
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
A more accurate sort of version of it

918
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
I would be like

919
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
Lyric

920
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
From

921
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Don't let me get me

922
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,263
She has discovered your weird

923
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Popstar

924
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
The big record

925
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:00,415
And told me you'll be a popstar all you have to do is change everything

926
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
You are

927
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,487
That's sort of amor that really touched

928
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:10,399
Hello I just remembered absolutely but I think it's a more accurate version anime

929
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:15,519
11

930
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
I think it's a compelling narrative mostly be

931
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
Because she used to be

932
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Christian artists

933
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
And her real name is Kate Hudson

934
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,247
And as you can't go by that

935
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,807
And Grammys

936
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,135
Thoughts about her

937
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,975
Spell out the specific was a Christian music

938
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
Decided to dress up

939
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
Yeah

940
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
He has he has more thoughts about the

941
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
He's going to get into

942
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
Some witchcraft stuff

943
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
I'll break down a little bit further

944
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
When we get

945
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,847
He's just going to stop

946
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
From there

947
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,759
Let's talk about this together

948
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:03,903
Fairies for Lady Gaga

949
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:11,839
Also podcast say that every time I talk about Katy Perry

950
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,375
Or Lady Gaga

951
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:21,055
I do it a lot

952
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
Katy Perry Lady Gaga

953
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
All the time

954
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:30,527
People think I'm the lunatic

955
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
Oh man what are we going to get rainbow snatch recording

956
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
She might be on the bench

957
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,207
Use not that she's not.

958
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
The last week or so

959
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,839
I'm making up

960
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:57,407
Watch the Super Bowl events are you watch the MTV

961
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,759
They are chopped everything from classical Satanism black magic

962
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,879
Egyptian occultic stop it just runs the gamut

963
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,487
I've covered the only person ever sneak into Bohemian Grove

964
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,791
Time to get out the photos without being arrested

965
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:18,143
I'd also like to again remind everyone look into the real story of that is not at all

966
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,983
Also I really love the

967
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
The Superbowl show do you remember the one where Alec

968
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,127
Aleister Crowley did it

969
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,247
Yeah

970
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Was there cuz

971
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,671
I don't know I don't know

972
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:45,023
Pink Eminem

973
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,143
Alright alright you got it

974
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,959
I like I like how is witchcraft

975
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,751
Whatever you believe

976
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,799
Witchcraft is real

977
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:02,431
Sure that's his leg

978
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:08,831
Like how Neil deGrasse Tyson whether or not you believe it

979
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
Sodas witchcraft

980
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,927
Apparently universal truth

981
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
But witchcraft

982
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
They're witches

983
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,559
I mean like if you want

984
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,887
People for it if you want to look into the history of satanic

985
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,471
Panic and like how much danger it damage

986
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:32,383
I don't know who cares what happens over and over throughout history

987
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,455
We just keep getting scared of demonic forces

988
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
And it just makes us to Portable thing

989
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,855
You go back to like

990
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
Tons of

991
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,927
Cases of what was the McMartin

992
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:48,767
School case

993
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,815
Does happen

994
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,887
Mental

995
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,007
16 years ago

996
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
All of that

997
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,871
My uncle might be a part of that

998
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:10,015
My uncle

999
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,599
He just had religious ideas about psychiatrist

1000
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
Haywood tractor

1001
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,983
It's pretty hardcore

1002
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,775
I know

1003
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
And so

1004
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,759
Yep he's a preacher show

1005
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
Long pause

1006
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,695
Is fully

1007
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
Aware

1008
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,119
Of what she's doing and what she's up to it that you supposedly get power

1009
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,911
In this world

1010
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,359
Imagine

1011
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
Nationalism

1012
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,223
Christian Roots of Europe's bad I mean whoa

1013
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
Bassinet

1014
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
The devil

1015
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Morningstar

1016
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,487
Franklin

1017
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
Pope Francis is the devil

1018
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,071
According to Alex Jones

1019
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
Pope Francis

1020
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,423
Does the dark pope know cuz there is a black pope

1021
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,775
Well if you've ever seen the fantastic movie The Order

1022
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
What's his face

1023
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,855
Hottest women alive

1024
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:56,255
Take it was great it was a terrible movie so I love you and 40 nights

1025
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,863
I can jack off for lunch

1026
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,423
Josh Hartnett

1027
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:10,591
Him with a rose petal

1028
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,223
She's easy

1029
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
All that stuff you were saying

1030
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
All the stuff you saying is again misinterpreting

1031
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
Quotes

1032
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,207
One of the Pope

1033
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,511
Things about Muslim terrorism not existing

1034
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
Broke down

1035
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,607
Why Alex is lying and it's honest about that

1036
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,935
When he talks about populism but the pope was saying is

1037
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,263
Historically populist movements have ended up very poorly

1038
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,799
Know that

1039
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,871
Christianity the nationalism

1040
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,407
Witches are

1041
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,199
Both the enemy of Christianity

1042
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
Witches

1043
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
Yeah remember earlier he was going there again

1044
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
Christianity

1045
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
Nationalism

1046
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,327
I must have I must have tuned that out

1047
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,119
Can just put Alex in July

1048
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,167
He just becomes white noise at some point

1049
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,191
And

1050
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,007
But

1051
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,567
Again it's another misrepresentation of what the Pope

1052
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,871
Demonize him and pretend

1053
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,175
Alex's version Christianity

1054
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
The mainstream version is Dima

1055
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,759
Hope the pope is

1056
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
The devil

1057
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
That's heretic

1058
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,855
That's pretty bad

1059
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:30,463
Especially considering in the same interview where he talks about populism ending up

1060
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,999
Which I think

1061
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,535
History Bears out

1062
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,375
Most of the time they've been populist movements it's ended up in disaster

1063
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,655
The French Revolution work

1064
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Okay no

1065
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,543
No

1066
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,639
The Arab Spring

1067
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
Germany that was great

1068
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
No

1069
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,647
They put in the same we don't have a lot of good ones

1070
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,975
Is there about

1071
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,791
Like the idea that people think of him as

1072
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,327
Different than a normal person

1073
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
A easy song about how like

1074
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,423
I'm just a normal believer

1075
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,471
I'm just another Christian

1076
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,519
That's what I am

1077
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,287
We have

1078
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
We have

1079
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,919
Revealed that he may not believe in

1080
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Basic tenets

1081
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
The Christianity

1082
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
Alex

1083
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
Alex

1084
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:31,647
I think the pope has at least one or two under his belt

1085
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,047
Galaxy

1086
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
You basically just said

1087
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,423
I just can't believe in anything that even relates

1088
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
To your and I up

1089
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
I don't know I

1090
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,567
But I think he also probably

1091
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
Maybe believe some of the

1092
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Stuft Pizza in

1093
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:56,479
Like the Lost gospels and s*** like that a lot of his books

1094
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,807
We're kicked out of the Bible

1095
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:07,231
Probably include some of that metaphysical stuff

1096
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:07,999
That you seem

1097
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
3 super into

1098
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,375
Where is mainstream Christianity really doesn't have a lot of

1099
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,191
No but if you get into like alarm

1100
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,031
If you get into the Lost Books of the Bible and forgotten books of

1101
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,103
Or the like the Apocrypha

1102
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,431
Didn't feel like all of these books that are part of the normal Canon

1103
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
You end up with some

1104
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,783
Some pretty wild stuff

1105
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:36,671
The pole first women there is evil in there

1106
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
The gospels just f**** every

1107
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679
She is evil

1108
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,471
As we all know

1109
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,775
Used to be a kick-ass music

1110
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,591
Wish I was old enough to go backgrounds

1111
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,127
It would have been good

1112
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
More Wichita

1113
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:14,559
Music

1114
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:32,991
I want to make you feel powerless they want to throw stuff out but also deny it

1115
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,319
Make you just give up

1116
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,647
There was that witch

1117
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
Energy

1118
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:45,279
Thing that they did in their wanton Worthy

1119
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,839
Yeah nobody believes in this s*** but hey

1120
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,911
Point your energy

1121
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,495
Hippies trying to levitate the Pentagon

1122
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
Liberals don't believe this

1123
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,895
Is everyone

1124
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
But you take it seriously alright

1125
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:09,343
That's why people think you're insane but the other thing too is that there's a long history of Alex Jones being

1126
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,623
Trolled by satanists

1127
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,183
Right

1128
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,303
Okay we want to put up a satanic

1129
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:24,959
We're going to do the Ten Commandments we get to put Satan up there f*** you b****

1130
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,775
Firm logic

1131
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,103
To be like okay you don't want to take down your religious thing

1132
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,919
You must tolerate

1133
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
Public building

1134
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:39,551
Otherwise you are religious

1135
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,647
Falls for it every f****** time hook lion

1136
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,975
So he's talking about these witches getting together

1137
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Pray for

1138
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,047
Wright Medical

1139
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,887
Who's that using spells to get bring down President Trump

1140
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,423
Where is before

1141
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
He would encourage people to pray

1142
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,751
Against Obama

1143
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
It is

1144
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
Spells are very different

1145
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,943
In one you chant

1146
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,783
And try to appeal to a higher power to influence real

1147
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,623
You chance

1148
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,415
And then like probably

1149
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,815
One of them is theoretical

1150
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,607
L.ron Hubbard does

1151
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
You know

1152
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,703
And I was part of that

1153
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,775
Spotify

1154
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,847
We don't support Aleister Crowley

1155
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,223
Who is pretty cool

1156
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,039
He came up on the podcast

1157
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
Time before the right

1158
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,207
Who is El Ron Hubbard

1159
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:50,975
Spelled

1160
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Magic

1161
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,607
Anyway who cares that's irrelevant

1162
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
Today we got to get to

1163
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Jordans

1164
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,031
The uninviting Seas of race talk

1165
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,639
Alright alright this is one of the big narratives on Thursdays show

1166
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
About Jorge Ramos

1167
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Right

1168
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,295
He mentioned his name earlier and now we're going to

1169
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,575
Is the exactly why

1170
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
Jorge Ramos is

1171
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,927
Univision TV

1172
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,791
Alex frequently on this episode called him George

1173
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,839
Which I think is installed

1174
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,119
But he

1175
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
You can't hear interview with

1176
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
Tucker Carlson

1177
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
That which is what

1178
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,287
Is going to be broken down by Alex

1179
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,871
Promises the one kicked out of the

1180
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
I don't know

1181
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,455
I believe I believe he was

1182
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,759
Okay I'm not

1183
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
But

1184
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
He is

1185
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Univision

1186
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
Yankee recently had

1187
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Speech

1188
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:56,767
Where he was talking about how there's a lot of immigrants

1189
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
To be here

1190
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,071
And it is not verecund

1191
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
It is all Ark

1192
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,423
That could be misinterpreted

1193
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
2

1194
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,495
Understood

1195
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
Country now b****

1196
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,895
That was not what

1197
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
That would be

1198
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:21,599
Pretty funny

1199
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:27,743
I don't like I don't like the idea of this being anyone's country other than all of ours

1200
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,559
Maybe he was thinking we should trade

1201
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
Like

1202
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,119
Bekins Moving

1203
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
It states all the

1204
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:40,287
States moving to the mini Balada Beach down there the food is

1205
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:46,687
Great people

1206
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,807
Just

1207
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,111
Even trade

1208
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,159
I don't know if I want to go move to Mex

1209
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,511
Tacoma trade countries I'm just eating frozen pizza

1210
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,815
Alright

1211
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,167
Another big part of his point and he'll elaborate on it a little bit

1212
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,703
Is that

1213
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,007
Within twenty years or so

1214
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,543
White people will be

1215
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
A minority

1216
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,871
I will be able to redeem Authority country

1217
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
Everyone will be minority

1218
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:24,063
Threatening idea to people who are super into being

1219
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,135
Threatening idea to me at all

1220
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
I don't like

1221
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,975
Anybody who's super into being white

1222
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Yeah it's

1223
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,047
It's worrisome

1224
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,143
Historically is very murder

1225
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,239
These are the main thing is that this Ramos interview

1226
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
To do with

1227
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,823
Alex takes it

1228
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,615
2 weird directions

1229
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,943
Add frequently called Jorge Ramos erased

1230
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,479
What race

1231
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,015
Help which I want to be clear

1232
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
If you ever use the term race pimp

1233
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,111
And you were quoting Alex Jones

1234
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
You're welcome

1235
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,183
Problem also if you ever

1236
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,719
Use the term

1237
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,279
Explain to me what that supposed to mean

1238
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,607
You're pimping races baby I don't understand what that

1239
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
It means

1240
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Think

1241
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,215
You're making money

1242
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,263
Trying to get races to fight each

1243
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Or something

1244
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:17,823
Which

1245
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
Kind of describe

1246
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,919
Yeah also

1247
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,527
Note that still doesn't make sense using the two words put together

1248
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Race pimp

1249
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,575
That suggests

1250
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
That you are making money

1251
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,159
Selling

1252
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Racist

1253
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,231
Well yeah

1254
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,255
Kind of

1255
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Now

1256
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
Or talk about

1257
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,351
People are we talkin

1258
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
About

1259
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,655
Astros

1260
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
Painting face

1261
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,751
That's really what I think Alex is saying is that

1262
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,031
Jorge Ramos

1263
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,567
Spell

1264
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,383
Black face paint for a day

1265
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,967
It's possible it's possible

1266
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,991
Possible

1267
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,783
Here is

1268
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:04,415
That might be a fun service here's the introduction to Alex talking about this interview and

1269
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
I can't confirm

1270
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Any of them

1271
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,791
Things he says in this

1272
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
I don't care

1273
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Cuz it's

1274
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,423
It's super weird

1275
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,471
Ramos

1276
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,431
Also I want to say that

1277
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:35,135
Alex one of his big argument that he's trying to make is like

1278
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:41,535
I don't care about race talk about this.

1279
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
Yeah it looks like

1280
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,351
Too much

1281
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,215
When we used to think the people here were Indians

1282
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,007
I think he's pointing up

1283
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,311
That it's bad that you

1284
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
You got Native American

1285
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,943
That's what he saying right there

1286
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,015
It gets so weird

1287
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:08,415
Circumnavigate

1288
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
Mexico

1289
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:11,999
Honey

1290
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,631
Cuz there's not one

1291
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,847
Images of American

1292
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
Person

1293
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:32,991
Complete

1294
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Absolute

1295
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
What is

1296
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:47,071
Oh boy whitesplaining Hispanic Miss

1297
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:53,471
I have to pause just so you could get that out before he gets well or whitesplaining it okay

1298
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
Let's find this out

1299
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,543
It's not just in Spanish

1300
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,383
What they are

1301
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:06,783
Oh I'm going to sit back and let this I am going to watch this over my head like

1302
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
Like so much

1303
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
And they were Arab

1304
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,999
African

1305
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,839
Search

1306
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,191
25% of them have African

1307
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,991
Basically Germanic

1308
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,783
A little bit African

1309
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,391
And in some Asia

1310
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,559
Chinese

1311
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,703
What is

1312
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Sound through the top

1313
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:09,247
I'm countries are on the continent today of North America Central America South America

1314
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
Colonial

1315
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:20,767
With almost telling you this

1316
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:33,567
Spaceships

1317
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
Okay good good

1318
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
Good on you there at the end

1319
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
Yeah

1320
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,511
That's interesting right

1321
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
That's pretty good

1322
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
Pretty good stuff

1323
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
Pretty good breakdown

1324
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,447
I don't understand

1325
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,007
Bora Bora

1326
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,799
Creative hierarchy

1327
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
1

1328
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
Knowledge

1329
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
Very poor

1330
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
It's a very very poor

1331
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,015
It's surface-level

1332
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:14,783
Also

1333
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
China

1334
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,087
You can't be Chinese

1335
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:23,487
10000 years before if you want to be generous to him

1336
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,023
Is be like sort of genetic

1337
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
Why

1338
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
Become China broekhoff

1339
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
Yeah

1340
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,167
They were from the land continents of

1341
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,215
Right as we know it

1342
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
Is

1343
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,079
Silly

1344
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:43,711
Like because because if you're going to if you're going to pull this s*** just say everybody was in

1345
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
African

1346
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Just do that

1347
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:49,087
That's where human beings came from so we're all Africa

1348
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,159
Now if you say we're all African

1349
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,767
Right

1350
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,303
I mean

1351
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,935
I don't have a full understand

1352
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
Meaning of genetics

1353
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Oroville

1354
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
The history of genetics

1355
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:10,591
Blonde hair blue eyes

1356
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
That's Nordic

1357
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,687
I know enough that I know he's wrong

1358
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
That's where I'm at

1359
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
I can't

1360
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,503
Without

1361
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,831
Like taking a college course on why he's wrong

1362
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
He's he's got this like

1363
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,487
This fundamental mendelian

1364
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
Jeanette

1365
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,327
Concept that we all know isn't real

1366
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
If you have to be plant

1367
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,703
You're going to get

1368
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,751
This is dumb

1369
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,079
Everything he says is dumb

1370
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,871
Another that make sense

1371
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,199
What is even this point I don't know what is even his point is this

1372
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,759
They're saying hate White

1373
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,063
People when you don't know that you're

1374
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
A white person

1375
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,367
Or your Arabic

1376
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,671
Chinese

1377
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:02,559
What is his what is his ultimate point there at the end of the day even if he's right about all of it doesn't

1378
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
Really

1379
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,607
Theme to mean anything

1380
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,631
Thing other than

1381
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,471
You think you're you think your Mexican but you're all these other thing

1382
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,775
Coast you so close to talk

1383
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
About Colonial

1384
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
Like the ruling class

1385
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
Mexico

1386
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,639
Is he

1387
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,663
He's really close

1388
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,967
There

1389
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,991
They're not

1390
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,271
Hispanic

1391
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,831
Because they were colonized

1392
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,927
That's what I think

1393
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,231
It's possible

1394
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
Then you saying that

1395
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,559
The true colonialism

1396
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,375
The Mexicans

1397
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,191
Maybe or the Moors

1398
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,103
Before that

1399
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
What are we doing

1400
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:58,367
But but his argument then is that in 1776 America was trying to undo all that sort of stuff

1401
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:04,767
Don't know there was a middle-class whatever so very much

1402
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
We can

1403
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,495
He doesn't

1404
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,055
Drawing in this like middle classes

1405
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,103
OK Google

1406
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,663
Of the United States is a strong middle

1407
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:22,943
Yeah

1408
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,087
Strong middle classes

1409
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,623
The positive negative

1410
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,671
I mean but yeah that's

1411
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
No

1412
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:41,631
There's always a strong middle class

1413
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:47,519
Does he not want to ruin class if you have a middle class you have the other classes

1414
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,567
You don't just have one middle class

1415
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,895
I don't know if I want to stay here forever on being

1416
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,711
What we're doing is

1417
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
Info on

1418
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
Communism

1419
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
I think we were social

1420
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
And then obvious

1421
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
That led to Communism

1422
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:05,695
And now we're going to overthrow

1423
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,815
Is the opposite of what most

1424
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,887
Crazy people about socialism

1425
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,471
Let's get to this Ramos clip

1426
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:22,591
He doesn't remember we have a rich history on this phone

1427
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
If you

1428
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,175
Native American you're Chinese

1429
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,247
We have a rich history on this show of

1430
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,527
Looking at Alex's

1431
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,807
Media criticism

1432
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,623
Right

1433
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,439
Truman Show

1434
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,231
So I can go into town

1435
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,351
My favorite part of all of these media credits

1436
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,655
Is he never criticizes

1437
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
So it is always

1438
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,775
Let the guy get two words top and then

1439
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,079
He looks like

1440
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:59,711
He looks like he just had sex with other men all the time

1441
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,735
When is face

1442
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,551
He's a pedophile that Facebook's everybody

1443
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
Still not great

1444
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,327
Groceries half-Hispanic

1445
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
Tony

1446
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,591
Free market and private property and guns and raising your own

1447
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,615
Kids

1448
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:32,735
He's saying this about like a and private property

1449
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
Property

1450
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:38,879
Don't you want guns

1451
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,671
Population

1452
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,767
Country

1453
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,559
People are passing along the torch

1454
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,351
Pre-market

1455
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:55,775
His idea is substantially worse than what Jorge Ramos

1456
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
Abortions

1457
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:09,855
Deadly inoculations

1458
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,959
He's doing a teller

1459
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:31,103
Brake adjuster so much.

1460
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:35,199
It's going nuts

1461
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:40,319
Every single episode there's some crumpling paper and if you're watching the video

1462
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,671
Like you shuffling through papers boy

1463
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,695
So awesome

1464
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,511
I love it so much

1465
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
Sickening

1466
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,607
Absolutely

1467
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,887
Completely

1468
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,911
Sickening

1469
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,543
This is disgusting

1470
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,783
The monster

1471
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:15,903
What school does what kids are forced at California

1472
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,071
Good old-fashioned

1473
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,863
Can't wear American flags

1474
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,655
School referral ladybug

1475
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:33,055
If you actually go look into the night circuit decision about that just as a quick reminder

1476
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,847
Kid being bullied by kids on

1477
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,151
Cinco de Mayo

1478
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:37,919
It many

1479
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,199
Pictures of harassment

1480
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,735
Buy kids wearing American

1481
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,295
Flags of being like suck you on Cinco de Mayo

1482
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,087
And the night Circuit Court rule

1483
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,623
Not that you can't

1484
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,159
Where are American flags

1485
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,047
Specifically on Cinco de Mayo

1486
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
That was okay

1487
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,375
That wasn't it wasn't

1488
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,399
Against free speech

1489
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,423
Which

1490
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
Is not with Alex

1491
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,775
Jorge Ramos

1492
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,823
Erase Pimpin Ain't Easy

1493
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,383
But it sure is fun

1494
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,991
People like

1495
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
Ramos

1496
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
Oh boy

1497
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:31,935
I wonder who

1498
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,847
He does I wonder who he's going to tell

1499
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,639
Katy Perry

1500
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,223
Becoming like a dark horse in the bed family

1501
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:47,807
I don't know man

1502
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,855
It's fun

1503
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,415
It is sort of our principals

1504
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,279
Business bringing other people

1505
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,983
It's not that what he's doing is shity and we can call it out

1506
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Because

1507
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:11,871
It's against our principles except his kid

1508
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,663
And we're still not mean to him

1509
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
So like

1510
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:20,831
Well it's whatever he's accusing us of doing he's doing that gives us free reign to do

1511
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,159
About his family

1512
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:28,255
But I don't repeat on the air and I don't think it necessarily true

1513
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
Anyway

1514
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:37,727
Mexico

1515
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,543
Separate from

1516
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,823
15 Generations

1517
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:02,303
Slug an enemy of humanity

1518
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,143
You have your job wide-open

1519
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
Okay

1520
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
Hispanic

1521
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
KKK

1522
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360

1524
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,016
I didn't know all of those words could be used to describe the same person and

1525
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:27,136
Could be undone if he adopted a quote

1526
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,304
People first

1527
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,072
I'm not sure

1528
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:40,704
Does he think everybody who hasn't talked to the Korean is raises

1529
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:44,288

We're going to get this ship ethically sound

1533
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,528
According to Alex

1534
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,832
Just by introducing the third house

1535
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:01,184
Google gaga

1536
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,256
Are we going to

1537
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,816
Okay good.

1538
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,880
In the US

1539
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,608
This is also our country

1540
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,888
Is our country

1541
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:45,216
Whose country is it

1542
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:49,312
Adidas

1544
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,184
This is not a white country

1545

1546
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,264

Songs on channel Monterey's Club

1548
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:33,088
To explain a

1549
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,392
Who is

1550
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:47,168
Who believed that Latinos can immigrants

1551
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,496
Obviously there are white people that are tribe

1552
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:56,640
Ilysm

1553
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:03,040
The Bulls and the point is is that the left has broken the

1554
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,064
Social compact

1555
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,368
I'm bringing people in there hard Waters

1556
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,704
Alright

1557
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,264
George

1558
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:29,664
You and other people.

1559
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:36,064
Guadalupe Hidalgo treaty

1560
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
Ramos is playing

1561
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,696
As a blanket statement

1562
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
Their country

1563
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,304
Who says

1564
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,328
If Mike Hunt

1565
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,400
Meaning you don't get to

1566
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,448
Choose that your country is

1567
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:59,104
Exactly what Alex figured out and somehow got wrong still

1568
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,640
Yeah Alex

1569
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,248
It's remarkable

1570
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:11,648
And if you stay I mean what he saying is that. Just

1571
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
For tribal

1572
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
Ray Ray

1573
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,488
I think you're misunderstanding what he was saying

1574
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
That little

1575
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,096
He was trying to say that racism is really

1576
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:20,864
Just tribalism

1577
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
Right

1578
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
And that is

1579
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,448
Is a I think

1580
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
Clunky.

1581
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,688
Some of it is

1582
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
No some of it is just

1583
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
Good old-fashioned

1584
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,392
Country

1585
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,928
To try and Rebrand

1586
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,256
Racism is tribalism is to take some of the stink off

1587
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
A little bit

1588
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,072
And that is what he was doing

1589
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,120
I mean

1590
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,472
I might be wrong but that's my take

1591
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
I mean

1592
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,616
If you remember tribalism

1593
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:08,992
Usually

1594
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,624
It doesn't have it doesn't carry the same modern connotation

1595
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,952
And I believe so you're right

1596
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,256
He can get around the racist

1597
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:33,824
The boo yaa tribe

1598
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Ivan the name

1599
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
We all try

1600
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,528
Really

1601
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,064
Well what that was like

1602
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,624
My internal monologue was

1603
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,160
Damn I'm proud I pulled

1604
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,824
Very good

1605
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,736
I think a lot of that is really awful

1606
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,296
Alex's interpretation of that

1607
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
Tucker Carlson is not

1608
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,880
Understand what Jorge Ramos is

1609
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,160
Isaac Wilson

1610
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:23,488
He says

1611
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,768
You're white

1612
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,816
And I'm pretty sure he's talking about

1613
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,352
Skin colored nuts

1614
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,376
Genetics or

1615
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,656
Which Alex

1616
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,192
Previously has explained

1617
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:36,544
Which is

1618
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,080
You're like me

1619
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,872
An incredibly white person

1620
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:42,432
Right

1621
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:48,320
Bowtie on air

1622
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,600
The you are white

1623
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:53,440

Kitty White

1625
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,888
But it's certainly within Tucker Carlson sort of modus operandi

1626
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:07,264
Do not understand people intentionally in order to try and bake them into

1627
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,616
What's my name to giving a sound playback like therapy

He is saying that

1697
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:37,696
That's exactly what this is our country

1698

The Drudge Report headlines

1701
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,704
Basically

1702
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
The first part of a set

1703
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,288
Cut out the middle

1704
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
And then

1705
01:30:55,104 --> 01:31:01,248
And then also different together and made it seem like Ramos was threatening everybody

1706
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,296
I can sentence which gets into all of the

1707
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,320

1708
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:08,928
What they do what they do

1709
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
Narrative

1710
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,232
Is that we're always

1711
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,072
They're always trying to take

1712
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,352
Which

1713
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:22,240
Is interesting because I don't think anybody the one thing that white people I have never

1714
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,776
Giving away

1715
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:24,800
Is whiteness

1716
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,592
No nobody wants

1717
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,384
Nobody wants

1718
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,968
Good is

1719
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,760
Nerdy

1720
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,576
Which

1721
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,368
We are the apps

1722
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,416
Sense of humanity

1723
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,000
Sure I don't want to I don't want to go into like a

1724
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,864
Indictment of the idea of whiteness being Define

1725
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
And as not

1726
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,400
Other phone

1727
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:53,216
Which is really the historical origins of white

1728
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,032
Because I would require

1729
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,944
I mean

1730
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,576
Whiteness has always been defined as

1731
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
In contrast

1732
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,112
Two other things

1733
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:10,880
Which is why

1734
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,696
There are large groups of people who are like

1735
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,720
His wife

1736
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:21,888
Is deeply entrenched in the history of the concept of whiteness

1737
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,680
Horrible

1738
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,704
Horrible

1739
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
Damaging

1740
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,752
Philosophy

1741
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,776
Alex Jones

1742
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
Super into

1743
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,848
If you go back to history

1744
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:34,176
Anytime we will have met another Society

1745
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,712
Start bad for them

1746
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:41,600
Every every time every time you read a story

1747
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,672
From history I'm always like

1748
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,976
Welcome to the White

1749
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:51,584
People in in your head it's like

1750
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,424
Horror movie

1751
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
Absolutely

1752
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,472
Highway

1753
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,008
Race them

1754
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,384
System

1755
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,944
Daniel Leach little subgroups

1756
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,224
Off against each other

1757
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:12,064
Disgusting

1758
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,344
That's how they do it

1759
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,488
There's a little turtle of

1760
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:22,048
Like truth in that but Alex doesn't recognize

1761
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,328
She also does that

1762
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
To an extreme

1763
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,472
We can't celebrate

1764
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,752
Him staying one right

1765
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,848
He's accusing other race

1766
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,640
Yeah of being involved in

1767
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,688
I think if we just give him posit

1768
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,736
Feedback when he's right

1769
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,784
He'll eventually

1770
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,064
Learn he just wants

1771
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,856
People don't like it but what episode

1772
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,184
Cuz he wants us

1773
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
To like him

1774
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:54,304
The what episode where we talked about how great a couple of his philosophies were

1775
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:00,704
Didn't get one bed pictures still not hung up

1776
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,496
Nothing we can do that we haven't

1777
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
Put it down

1778
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,592
Picture of

1779
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:10,176
That's really our main.

1780
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,648
Latinos

1781
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,864
So even right there

1782
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,888
Ramos is

1783
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,168
A really great

1784
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,192
Distinction

1785
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:37,312
Non-white population

1786
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
Asian should be

1787
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,128
Accepted into the

1788
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,272
Music country

1789
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,552
It's not only there

1790
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,600
Which is a nuance

1791
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:54,208
It's really understood

1792
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,024
Absorb that information synthesized

1793
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
And then changed his

1794
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,840
You might be wrong

1795
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:04,448
I might be wrong

1796
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:10,848
Endom and we have to leave and be tormented that's exactly what I was

1797
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,904
Where he says we have to be Multicultural live together

1798
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,976
Like that

1799
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,792
American flags in public school system settings

1800
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:33,120
Because they're Spanish

1801
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
Stop it

1802
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,240
Again that he's bringing up the exact same thing

1803
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:42,336
Interview

1804
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,688
These kids were being bullied and harassed

1805
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,784
Chesterfield

1806
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,320
It's like you're a p****

1807
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
You victims

1808
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
Horrible

1809
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,440
Horrible

1810
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,024
Alma Court

1811
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,304
You are a dick

1812
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,096
Where where are you

1813
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,912
Racist

1814
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,472
Commenting on another racist

1815
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:13,824
Being racist towards a Jorge Ramos

1816
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:32,256
So you can pull up

1817
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,168
I did pull up that ruling

1818
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,960
And you're lying

1819
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
Alex

1820
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,800
Don't tell people to pull things up

1821
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:49,920
Don't do that that's really against your self-interest

1822
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:57,856
You need to not encourage people to look into some it's a really really dangerous

1823
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,696
Give advice to Alex if you want to keep lying like this

1824
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:04,256
Consistently you need people to not looking

1825
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,352
The best way to

1826
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,144
To keep people from looking into it

1827
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:13,472
Tell them to look into it

1828
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:16,288
From your like DUIs or matter what you look at

1829
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:22,688
I know I'm right you assert with confidence it's much like what episode

1830
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,528
Probably true

1831
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,368
This is this is

1832
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,904
Political correctness

1833
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,488
Beating up Trump supporters

1834
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,304
You're intolerant your bullies

1835
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,096
That's not politically correct

1836
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:46,496
Only place that I specifically heard about Trump's life being in danger

1837
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,776
Infowars

1838
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,824
I've never seen

1839
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,640
News article that talks

1840
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,688
Advocating killing Trump

1841
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,504
Right I've only seen dumb

1842
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Possibly

1843
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
Then

1844
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,088
Advocated for

1845
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,648
Alex talks about it everyday

1846
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
Maybe

1847
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,512
He's creating a ghost tomorrow

1848
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
He's going to kill.

1849
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,680
Ultimate Manchurian

1850
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008
Wild

1851
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,312
The best episode of knowledge fight

1852
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,384
Who are covering breaking news

1853
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,920
Alex Jones

1854
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,200
Kill the president

1855
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,480
Would be

1856
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,784
Astounding

1857
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
Crime of passion

1858
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,464
With a different radio

1859
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,072
Such a Betrayal on a love try my God

1860
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,120
Pennywise

1861
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:45,888
They're right here

1862
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
Seriously

1863
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,192
Does the number of movies and

1864
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,472
TV shows we've got a right

1865
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:56,128
Hispanic

1866
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:07,136
Bad Country

1867
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:12,000
P******

1868
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
Classic American

1869
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:17,376
Problem to

1870
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:22,752
Problem

1871
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:29,152
Population

1872
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,016
That's why we had to bring in

1873
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
Aldi's

1874
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,808
Other population

Refuel rrr

1876
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,648
People Force

1877
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,928
Because we were boarded

1878
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,208
Half of our kids

1879
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,048
Imagine the population growth

1880
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,328
We had aboard

1881
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,912
Crazy

1882
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:55,008
Absolutely

1883
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,288
Alex Jones

1884
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,568
Show

1885
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:00,128
His for multiple abortions

1886
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,664
Just keep that fire

1887
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,224
In case you were wondering whether or not

1888
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,904
The third world

1889
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,208
Is being used as a weapon system

1890
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:20,608
Against the first world to drive down wages and that's why the Republican or Democratic

1891
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:25,728
The biggest immigration histories ever seen of the unwashed masses

1892
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:28,800
Diseases

1893
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:34,432
Health problems you name it to bankrupt and things down they want to blow

1894
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:40,832
Out Western economy and consolidate control that should Mitten cloward-piven it submitted in the UN strategy

1895
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:45,184
And this plan of globalism to flood the first world and implode it

1896
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,280
So that they can dictate the terms of our must be stopped

1897
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:53,632
So there's that part where you recognized

1898
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,656
A slight truth

1899
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,448
Conclusion

1900
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
He brings up

1901
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:04,384
Cloward and Piven a lot and I think

1902
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:09,248
It was exactly what it is

1903
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:16,160
The cloward-piven strategy of the political strategy outlined in

1904
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:19,488
66 by American sociologist and political activist

1905
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,792
Richard cloward and Frances Fox Piven

1906
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:25,120
The culture overload in the US public welfare system

1907
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,912
In order to precipitate a crisis

1908
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:29,984
That would lead to replacement of the welfare system with a national

1909
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,288
System of a guaranteed annual income

1910
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,056
And thoughts

1911
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,128
Okay it was

1912
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,408
Put into effect

1913
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,176
Can't imagine

1914
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,968
1966

1915
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,272
A couple of professors

1916
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,296
That was

1917
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,064
Hey

1918
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
Guess what

1919
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:47,904
Are entitled to benefits that they aren't taken

1920
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:52,000
There's a lot of people who are eligible for welfare

1921
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:58,144
Really if we create an awareness campaign people can get all of these

1922
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:01,728
Things that you're entitled to based on your low income

1923
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,776
What would do it was it would end up

1924
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,312
Bogging down

1925
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,848
S*** on a local

1926
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,872
And state-level

1927
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:12,736
So much so that these simpler way would just be to give everybody Universal

1928
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
It would create

1929
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,320
A crisis

1930
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,344
That would make

1931
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,928
The federal government recognize just how many people are living

1932
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,256
Livable condition

1933
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:34,496
But also what they are

1934
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,800
Entitled to under the current

1935
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,336
Welfare rule

1936
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,640
So it isn't which word

1937
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,456
Bible God damn

1938
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,736
1960s

1939
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:53,440
But he uses this is a thing that you don't know what it is

1940
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:55,232
It sounds like a law firm that I would

1941
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
Play higher that's

1942
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:01,120
It sounds like some mysterious

1943
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:05,216
But if you came up with

1944
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,496
In the sixties

1945
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,776
Isn't

1946
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:08,800
In effect

1947
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,080
It's not real

1948
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
It didn't

1949
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,872
Get put into effect

1950
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:16,736
Nobody actually listen to it it's a liberal Boogeyman

1951
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,016
Absolutely

1952
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,064
Special

1953
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,672
You think so

1954
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:27,744
Maybe I think the law of unintended consequences

1955
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,864
Consequences would destroy that

1956
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,912
Running is not Universal basic income

1957
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,704
But the exact opposite

1958
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,520
And Universal f*** you to everybody on welfare

1959
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:42,848
Yeah that that is what a lot of thinkers have said

1960
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,896
Suggest

1961
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,736
Is that you end up with scapegoating and demonization of the poor

1962
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,040
Look what happened with health care

1963
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
Right

1964
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:58,208
Do you know who got scapegoated and demonized whatever we started making sure people had Healthcare

1965
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,744
People need help there

1966
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,024
But look like

1967
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:07,680
Direct example of how that doesn't work the end goal of it though I think is good terms of like

1968
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,984
The heart was in the right place in terms of

1969
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,056
Create a way to make people recognize how bad it is

1970
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,592
4 people who are living here

1971
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,152
I think that's positive

1972
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,344
In the way you know you're walking through a minefield

1973
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,952
And you probably couldn't navigate that wouldn't be able to do that

1974
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,744
Much like Agenda 21

1975
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,512
Is a

1976
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,280
Did you end

1977
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,864
That has no enforcement to it

1978
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,656
Is just a set of ideas

1979
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,448
That is not forced

1980
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,728
It's voluntary

1981
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:46,592
Almost the same thing

1982
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,640
It never was put into place

1983
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:49,920
It happened

1984
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,248
Nigh on fifty years ago

1985
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:56,832
That's the problem with all the names that we've come up with

1986
01:44:57,088 --> 01:45:02,208
Look if you and I co-authored this paper at home

1987
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:05,536
One with whatever that

1988
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,840
Paper flowers

1989
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:14,240
No that's carry the fries at home Zach would really hate would be amazing

1990
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:23,968
Do deaf people like kerosene prices

1991
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,016
He's not dumb.

1992
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
Lower

1993
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,624
Your house to be freezing your home to be freezing

1994
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:37,280
And Jorge Ramos and others and the Pope Francis can jump up and down with their race-baiting crap

1995
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,424
Population

1996
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:49,824
Pizzeria

1997
01:45:55,968 --> 01:46:02,112
Endom and we have to leave and be tormented

1998
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:12,608
What immigration restrictions would you favor in Mexico

1999
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:19,520
What's the restrictions in the country Mexico

2000
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,080
Wicked Ways

2001
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:46,400
People that shoot Coca-Cola or Sprite

2002
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:52,800
Great America

2003
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:58,176
Guatemala Guatemala

2004
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,456
I mean

2005
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,000
Harsher than the US

2006
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
Tell us

2007
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:19,168
Controls

2008
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:19,936
No

2009
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:21,984
Didn't do it

2010
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:34,528
Mexico can open itself up to Central and South America are you crazy

2011
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:40,672
Castle countries down there are in total turmoil with people starving on the streets everywhere

2012
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:43,232
Most of the

2013
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,352
Animals the cats and dogs

2014
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:52,960
The elite

2015
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,824
You want us to be like that too

2016
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,480
And you're on the big New World Order multinational owned Univision

2017
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,064
Got to eat those seals

2018
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,624
Got to eat the zoo animal

2019
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,232
Cuz he kept saying I'm not saying that's a good thing

2020
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,024
In the voice of

2021
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,608
You mean like torturing

2022
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,472
Too far

2023
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:31,872
I think I cut out the part where he says but he mentions the wall between Mexico

2024
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:33,152
Irm South

2025
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,944
Again that's the one that we

2026
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:37,248
That was just a chain link fence

2027
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,064
No estan meme

2028
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,624
He just ran

2029
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:49,024
Arizona Arizona then one that's in Israel

2030
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,560
Westbank

2031
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:56,448
No this is no wall it is

2032
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,728
Lush vegetation

2033
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,312
121 in an apartheid state

2034
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,128
And the other in the state of Apartheid

2035
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,552
I don't even know how to respond

2036
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,088
Anymore

2037
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,648
What is What is the

2038
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,672
Forgot too cuz I think

2039
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:21,024
Carlson

2040
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,328
But it's trying to pull a

2041
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,608
There right there

2042
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,632
Like you supposed to be like

2043
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:28,960
Oh well you think American should do this with

2044
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:31,264
What do you think about Mexico and what they're doing

2045
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,824
Scorpion charger

2046
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,104
Really easy

2047
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:39,200
To answer that would like yeah I don't like the way Mexico is doing that

2048
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,480
And

2049
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,296
We're starting to do that

2050
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,088
So don't

2051
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
And

2052
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:50,464
That's perfectly

2053
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,792
This whole thing

2054
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:57,888
Dictator

2055
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,240
Now that's rude

2056
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,432
And you're just a dick

2057
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:13,504
It's gauche secondary thing is that like

2058
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,552
Just because

2059
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:17,088
Some other country does it

2060
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,368
And we haven't

2061
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,392
Stopped

2062
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:21,696
Doing it doesn't mean that we don't have

2063
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:24,768
The power to stop them from Detroit

2064
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,560
I look

2065
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:29,120
I'll be very public

2066
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:34,240
All other I said you're opening yourself up for attack for

2067
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:37,568
Mostly from the southeast

2068
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,408
Lower

2069
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,224
I don't think of it

2070
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,760
It's fair to be like

2071
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:48,320
This country does that so what about that

2072
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:50,112
I think

2073
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,648
Two things can be bad

2074
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:54,976
At the same time it's a logical fallacy

2075
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:55,744
Critical

2076
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:59,328
Mexico's bad with it

2077
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,376
In the same way that we are being bad

2078
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,728
We can't get off the hook

2079
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:06,496
Could someone worse

2080
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:13,664
That was that the thing every time there's a Time

2081
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:18,272
The right-wing always goes to like

2082
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:21,088
Well it's better than Arabia

2083
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:25,952
Combat

2084
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:26,976
Males

2085
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:32,608
Go to close

2086
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,656
No it can it can both be bad

2087
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:37,216
We should try to not be that bad

2088
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:37,984
And then

2089
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,288
Still not be as bad as we are now

2090
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,592
What can improving be fun

2091
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
Yeah

2092
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,664
Christo's

2093
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,200
To progress

2094
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:49,504
It's not happening everywhere

2095
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:50,784
That makes perfect

2096
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:54,880
It's just very Ikea frog

2097
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:59,232
Otherwise nobody have to do it

2098
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,304
Wacky stuff for Less

2099
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,704
We're going to get Leanne Wackadoo up

2100
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,984
We are in this

2101
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,264
Bii

2102
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:14,592
I was trying to really put the

2103
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,360
English

2104
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,384
Biatch

2105
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,224
But I wish you fart

2106
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,504
So this next

2107
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,296
Alex

2108
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:25,088
Been proven right

2109
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,696
TV is listening

2110
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:32,256
It it all of us that he's been proven right

2111
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,024
And again

2112
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,304
Therefore

2113
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,608
You must believe everything else

2114
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,936
He takes the opportunity

2115
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,216
To Double Down

2116
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,752
Oh no

2117
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:43,776
Indignant

2118
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
Credible

2119
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
Yarn app

2120
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,384
Is just

2121
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,664
I've titled this one

2122
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:50,688
It gets worse

2123
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:59,392
Oh wow this isn't really Alex

2124
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:03,744
Wow

2125
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:15,008
Listening

2126
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,664
Cancer viruses

2127
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:28,320
In the polio vaccine in the MMR vaccine effective

2128
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:34,976
And then wait till a certain point

2129
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,512
Ourselves

2130
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,376
Literally did not pay you unemployment

2131
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,704
Retirement money

2132
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:52,640
The world

2133
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,296
We're all been implanted with with with with

2134
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,832
Termination switches

2135
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,624
So

2136
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,744
The only documented evidence I can

2137
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
And see if this is that

2138
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,048
Between 19

2139
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,072
5 + 9

2140
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
3

2141
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,376
There were some

2142
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
Contaminants

2143
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:18,240
Polio vaccine

2144
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,520
I was

2145
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:22,592
There's no way to track

2146
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,152
It was contaminated

2147
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:25,920
Bye

2148
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,712
Some of the byproducts they were using

2149
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:32,320
It hypothetically could have caused

2150
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:33,088
Some people

2151
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,392
Between 1955 and

2152
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,464
But the problem

2153
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,232
And corrected

2154
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,000
After that point

2155
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,328
Any other evidence

2156
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,168
It was not

2157
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,960
From everything I can find

2158
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,264
It was

2159
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,568
What medicine was like in the 50s

2160
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:57,664
Yeah it was not broke your leg

2161
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,736
The good old days in Metairie

2162
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:05,600
Yeah it was it was very Elementary science compared to what it is now

2163
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,648
Yeah and so they use

2164
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,232
To create vaccines you have to use

2165
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:13,024
Some of the live virus

2166
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,816
In order to

2167
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:19,168
There's there's a certain amount of that

2168
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,704
True and not true like

2169
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,240
What everybody think

2170
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,032
A vaccine is is like

2171
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,824
Dead version of the virus

2172
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:31,456
Yeah right

2173
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:36,320
It's best not every just like

2174
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:39,392
No they don't Hammer one down we got it

2175
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:44,768
Some of them are really easy to understand

2176
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:47,584
And that's why people get it in their head that all of them are

2177
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,632
And it's not

2178
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,400
It also

2179
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,448
When you're trying

2180
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:54,752
No

2181
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:58,592
They're not waiting for you to take unemployment

2182
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,616
They're not

2183
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,664
There's not like snowboard

2184
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,944
Like a giant like

2185
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,784
Pictures of like

2186
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:13,440
Hip like record producers room switches on it

2187
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,232
They're one of them says Jordan home

2188
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:20,096
That's why I got that MMR vaccine

2189
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,144
What you're saying is

2190
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,704
Kanye West

2191
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:27,264
In the recording studio

2192
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,056
Flip the wrong switch

2193
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:33,664
Yep

2194
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,504
This this thing with you talkin about

2195
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,552
Hypothetically affected

2196
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:41,344
98 million Americans

2197
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:42,624
Ending a night

2198
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:47,232
Hypothetically affected that many

2199
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,536
There's no evidence that it actually

2200
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:52,608
All of those people got cancer

2201
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:53,888
They didn't

2202
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,936
No probably some of them did

2203
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,960
And it's unfortunate

2204
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:59,520
And it's also possible they would have gotten cancer anyway

2205
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,056
Kids crazy

2206
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:04,384
In the course of

2207
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,176
Medicine being

2208
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:07,456
Living Art

2209
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,736
And being Progressive

2210
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:12,320
Even moving somewhere number one

2211
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,856
Killer in hospitals

2212
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,648
Infection first

2213
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,184
Mercer virus

2214
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,256
You're just in the wrong place

2215
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:25,120
I like that the end there's no way to perfectly decontaminate everything and

2216
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:28,704
Not enough doctors wash their hands and all of that

2217
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,776
Medicine is

2218
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:34,080
Bulshit

2219
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:39,456
Crypto cancer in the middle

2220
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,736
Triggered at some point when you

2221
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,504
You're stressed out

2222
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,784
Is complete b*******

2223
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,112
And the only thing that is documented at all and I can find

2224
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,136
Is something from

2225
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:48,160
50 years ago

2226
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,512
Good

2227
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,560
Strategy accomplished

2228
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,328
What it is

2229
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,120
You're looking

2230
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,400
To do

2231
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,168
We just keep

2232
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,192
People from unemployment

2233
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:00,960
Probably.

2234
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,056
Vaccine

2235
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:08,128
It'll be probably easier just to pass a bill

2236
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:17,344
We talked about earlier about diabetes that was based on a disc

2237
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,648
From years and years in the past

2238
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,416
We got lied

2239
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:28,352
Thoroughly debunked

2240
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,632
Stripped Away because

2241
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,936
Did NFL

2242
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,472
And poorly run studies

2243
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,800
We got lies on lies

2244
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:39,616
A lot of the arguments

2245
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:43,200
Then there are the positive one

2246
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,480
That are

2247
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,784
Again much like you've already

2248
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,320
All your friends ain't dying

2249
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,344
From

2250
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,880
Pollo

2251
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:56,256
Yeah which is a very real

2252
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:58,304
Everybody had

2253
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,096
You know anybody

2254
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:07,264
Good I bet it's because they have autism too much autism as we all know

2255
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:12,640
Autism kills polio

2256
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,480
Bolillo

2257
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,528
See there we go proves my theory

2258
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,552
If you thought

2259
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:22,624
Write your flow

2260
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,160
F****** Raw

2261
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:24,928
It gets worse

2262
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:47,200
That's literally what I was

2263
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:51,040
Just talkin about the sv40 thing to use

2264
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,064
C3

2265
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,600
Of

2266
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:54,880
A particular vaccine

2267
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,416
The Hyatt

2268
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:58,976
Estimated 98 million people got that vaccine

2269
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,512
So hundreds Plus

2270
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,280
Million

2271
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:03,328
Even then

2272
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:07,424
Wouldn't you have heard about the hundred plus million of

2273
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:11,264
People who died all very similarly around the same time

2274
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,032
I don't know

2275
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,056
But also

2276
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:15,872
I I got my information about

2277
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:18,432
The vaccine and in all this

2278
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,968
Like the backstory of it

2279
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:21,248
From legitimate sources

2280
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,808
I got the 98 million

2281
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:24,832
Total

2282
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:25,856
From

2283
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,624
Crazy

2284
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,648
Right-wing Bloc

2285
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:33,536
Okay Daddy number artificially inflated

2286
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:37,376
Then him artificial eating and artificially inflating

2287
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,656
Already

2288
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,424
Ridiculous

2289
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:44,800
Yeah

2290
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,824
Expertly into

2291
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,152
The idea that first

2292
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,432
Hundreds of Millions

2293
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:54,528
Confirm the CDC got cancer from SB

2294
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:56,064
V40 s*** is just

2295
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,856
There's no basis

2296
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,672
And even if there was the CDC would never

2297
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:03,232
Confirm that she let me know where.

2298
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:14,240
They're putting cheese

2299
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:17,824
Go into the nerves

2300
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,592
And then

2301
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:21,152
Activate later upon stress

2302
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:33,440
Actuary

2303
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:35,232
Yes you've been given

2304
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,584
Switch

2305
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:46,240
Don't worry you haven't

2306
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:53,152
By the way

2307
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:59,552
Ways to reverse it

2308
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:05,184
You're supposed to rain

2309
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:08,256
Probably

2310
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:13,632
I got a butt in Africa

2311
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,912
You will scream

2312
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,472
I guarantee you're going to scream

2313
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,056
Fuct

2314
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,208
The General Public

2315
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:42,048
I was talking about

2316
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:47,168
I was talking to the inteligencia

2317
02:02:54,592 --> 02:03:00,736
Liberalism

2318
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:01,760
British population

2319
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:07,136
You didn't get the vaccine

2320
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:14,304
Even

2321
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,144
On a scale of 1 to 10

2322
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:21,984
1

2323
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,592
You know

2324
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,616
450

2325
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,152
Say that pumps

2326
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:47,072
Auto and truck coming out

2327
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:53,216
Resurrection

2328
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,112
Here's the Big Lots

2329
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:13,440
Is ever telling yourself you're part of the power structure

2330
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:16,768
You're fooling yourself

2331
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:19,072
Atop Rockefeller or Rothschild

2332
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:19,840
Or somebody

2333
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:26,240
You know what JK Rowling

2334
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,848
Colorado time

2335
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:33,920
HP Lovecraft

2336
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,688
After book

2337
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:41,088
I love that he's dropping references to lesser-known Lovecraft books

2338
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:44,672
You know what basically describe the plot of the island

2339
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:51,072
50 time era is 425

2340
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:53,376
How does he know that chimeras

2341
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:55,680
I am before clones

2342
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,496
25 years

2343
02:04:59,008 --> 02:04:59,776
Is great source

2344
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,824
Wouldn't you start with chimeras

2345
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:08,224
Maybe I don't know video of Alex Jones

2346
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,272
Camaros for 50 years

2347
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:15,136
Heat flashes up a picture of a National Geographic article

2348
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:18,720
Human pig hybrid created

2349
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:23,328
This is January

2350
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:27,680
No

2351
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,448
4 months

2352
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,984
Before it died

2353
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,032
The idea of it here is

2354
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:35,616
Every 10 minutes a person is added to the National waiting list for Oregon

2355
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:39,968
Plant without an organ they need

2356
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,088
Inside an animal

2357
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:48,416
It's not pigs with human consciousness

2358
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
It's that

2359
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:53,024
Part of their organs will grow in a way that we can extract without

2360
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,048
Killing them

2361
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:57,632
Human organs

2362
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:03,776
I would like to know more about that

2363
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:06,080
Talking about

2364
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:09,152
What they flash upon the screen

2365
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,200
As evidence that he's right

2366
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:14,016
The screen that's behind him into Studio

2367
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,064
Is showing this article

2368
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,880
That I read that I have in front of me here that is

2369
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,416
Not about chimeras

2370
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:21,440
With human intelligence

2371
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:24,256
Pick bodies or whatever the f*** you imagine

2372
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:25,536
It is about

2373
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,816
Harvesting Oregon

2374
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:28,096
Also

2375
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,376
If they've had it

2376
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:30,656
A 25 years

2377
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:35,264
Nope I don't even know Geographic

2378
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,544
What is allowed to trickle it out

2379
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:37,824
Because they're getting us

2380
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,616
Using movies

2381
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:43,456
With predictive engineering or HP lovecraft's stories

2382
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:46,784
And out of time

2383
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:48,320
Colorado time

2384
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:49,344
Good book

2385
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,904
Isn't that book I recommend a lot of crap

2386
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:57,024
More anti-black to be on

2387
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:00,096
Oh okay

2388
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:02,400
Look why don't you go off on a Lovecraft

2389
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:05,472
But his racism is mostly in his earlier works

2390
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:07,008
An antique

2391
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:09,056
You can really see you like the

2392
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,336
The strain of that

2393
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,896
His later career

2394
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:15,456
You could tell that he was almost

2395
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,736
Yeah he's getting

2396
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:19,296
He's a product of his time

2397
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:20,320
I don't

2398
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,600
I don't think it's good

2399
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:23,136
That he had to some races

2400
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:23,904
Just believe

2401
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:24,672
But

2402
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,440
I think

2403
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:26,464
You can still enjoy lot of it

2404
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,768
Without

2405
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:30,048
The case of Arthur German

2406
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:35,936
Don't f*** the monkey

2407
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:40,800
You realize we're off to a good start there

2408
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,080
His later career

2409
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,128
My point is

2410
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,664
That I

2411
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,200
Out maybe there's

2412
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:47,968
Some Redemption for

2413
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:55,392
I don't think his trajectory is going the same direction as webcam

2414
02:07:55,648 --> 02:08:00,512
Is like okay scholarly paper the Lovecraft

2415
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:06,400
Does Alex Jones the artist

2416
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:09,216
Spell represent

2417
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,520
Using

2418
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:12,544
These things

2419
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,592
I-22 prop up a Target

2420
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:20,992
Timer on top of that using this idea that he was right about one thing to be evidence that you've gotta believe in butt

2421
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:23,040
I mean the Clones

2422
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,648
We've had

2423
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:28,416
50 years

2424
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:30,208
Everybody knows the fruits and

2425
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:36,864
No I prefer the

2426
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,656
Genetic code is through

2427
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,216
Okay

2428
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:41,984
Put it back together

2429
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,008
In the way that

2430
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:43,776
You know we want it

2431
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:45,568
Okay

2432
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,872
Like the biggest breakthrough ever

2433
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,152
In terms

2434
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:49,920
Genetics

2435
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:54,016
Okay that is not been around for 50 years

2436
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:56,576
Impossible

2437
02:08:57,088 --> 02:09:01,184
And it's not being used to make laws clones

2438
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,512
I think Alex might have gotten a phone call from somebody who told him this

2439
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:05,792
Or maybe a DM

2440
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:09,888
Maybe you got

2441
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:14,752
Gamekeeper

2442
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:18,848
I mean I'm just saying that if I were Alex Jones

2443
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,152
I would want to watch

2444
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,944
Adaptic

2445
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:25,504
Clone myself

2446
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,296
For an eventual

2447
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:30,880
Infowars

2448
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:37,536
Clear background clear about cloning

2449
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,096
You don't get a second

2450
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:43,424
Cloning works

2451
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,960
Is it full grown

2452
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:48,544
No you don't get a full-grown you it doesn't work that way

2453
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,824
Ucreate

2454
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:52,896
Something with like identical genetics essentially

2455
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:53,920
Which

2456
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:54,944
You could

2457
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:57,760
Which is

2458
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:01,856
Not really all that scary

2459
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:08,256
In the movie The Shining younger than you cuz

2460
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:11,072
Time for bed

2461
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:13,120
Clayton identical twin

2462
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:17,216
And it would not be any it would not be similar to a human clone

2463
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:18,496
Because it would have

2464
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:23,104
Totally different life experiences

2465
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:26,688
Gene's turn off and on depending on our environment

2466
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,224
Environment

2467
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:32,320
It's not real

2468
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:34,624

A really dark place

2474
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,912
By the way there's a movie with Andrew Garfield

2475
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,704

2476
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,472

That very thing

2480
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:58,176
Where there's a

2481
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,480
So it's all of these

2482
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:01,760
At this Hospital

2483
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:05,344

2484
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:06,368

02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:13,792
Theoretically they have all of these

2489
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:15,840
Life experiences within that but therein

2490
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:16,864
Entire life is

2491
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:17,632
Is built around

2492
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:18,912
We're eventually going to

Excellent against the globalist

2501
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:40,928
And I want to be clear when I get to the end

2502
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:43,744
Alec

2503
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,024
He's smiling

2504
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:51,680
Oh no really getting into telling him about what

2508
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,456
He's talking about signing on with the global

Neutron stars exploding

2511
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:17,792
Centrifugal force

2512
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:31,616

Play clap

2514
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:40,576
But if you'd come face-to-face with it you'd never curl up next to it

2515
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:47,488
God's protection

2516
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:48,256
Up against it

2517
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:54,912

Jamaica

2521
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,432
Because God is a Jessica

2522
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:14,880
Isn't that awful

2523
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:18,464
That was gross I was so gross

2524
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,000

But it's going to

2531
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:52,512
Asking to be just like those kids their backyards

2532
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:57,120
He's just

2533
02:13:57,376 --> 02:14:00,704
