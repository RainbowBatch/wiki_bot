1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:11,680
On this day

6
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
To ask you one

7
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,312
Have you ever been he's risen

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Sorry

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,408
He's risen from somewhere

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
Have you ever seen did you ever go to like a nativity play at your church Christmas Eve or Chris

11
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,392
Christmas day have you ever seen a good one

12
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm not positive I could critically review any of the

13
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
He wants from my past

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,352
I don't know exactly I would say

15
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
I have some vague memories of going to like me

16
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
Midnight masses was not Catholic

17
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
I still think they exist another

18
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
Denomination

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
Never lose beer

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
Fun I don't know why it is like you're up late

21
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Yeah later than you would be you know that Christmas

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,016
Misses that much closer younger absolute

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,320
Listen to novel thing

24
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,880
You know you're going to church at midnight

25
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
What is weird I don't know why I

26
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,024
Think of nativity scene there's something I drive

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,864
Past you know that's that's right that's right

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,472
The place that I put something in someone's yard

29
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Somebody in the place

30
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
The lights

31
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,736
Another version of that that's along with Christmas

32
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Mysterio

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Halloween decorations

34
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,648
Cal decorations

35
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
I don't know nothing sticks out in my head

36
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
I've seen a bunch of stuff

37
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
In-N-Out that manger scene

38
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
It has yeah

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,776
So I don't know I'm sorry I don't have a great answer for that but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

40
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Methodist podcast about you got it

41
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
So Jordan today

42
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
I wanted to celebrate this holiday hear this

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
This Christmas Day by giving myself again

44
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Okay good

45
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,160
That's the reason for the season

46
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,536
I don't know I think you'll be you'll get a charge out of some of this stuff that we end up talking about

47
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
I'll be the one to take a step away from Alex Jones

48
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
Take a take a

49
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Take a date

50
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Get something else that I want to look into

51
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
And then also the other thing that it is that I know that Alex has a tendency of getting a little Buck Wild around the holidays

52
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
But I don't want to I don't want to rush it

53
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
I want to save that for Monday Monday will have an Alex Jones

54
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
I was looking forward to finding out whether or not he thought that Jesus was an internet interdimensional alien.

55
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
Internet

56
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,424
No I believe it was last year he threw hatchets

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
Turn the studio on Christmas Eve

58
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
And I will see if you can talk himself this year

59
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
What else is there to throw

60
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
But that'll that'll be for Monday

61
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Okay

62
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
To do all right

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,296
Before we get to that that I take a little moment Jordan 6

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832

You were born after the Monkees

83
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
Take as much you're not probably work

84
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,679
Somebody donated on elevator

85
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Thank you so much you are now attacking

86
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
Business heroin

87
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
Freakishly large

88
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
Figure out there listening everything how I enjoy the show.

89
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
If I go on tour website knowledge fight.com

90
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,423
It says for the show we would appreciate any lovely

91
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
So Jordan today what I'm doing is I've been in a bit of an identity crisis with the show

92
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
A little bit

93
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Because

94
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
I feel like we've been in a situation where

95
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
We've had our wacky Wednesdays

96
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,551
And there've been problems that if it's there have been

97
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
Quarters we've tried to go down to half what are we doing

98
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,975
There's a fine balance do exactly what is

99
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,071
Is good to cover and what isn't and it's really difficult to walk that line

100
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,679
Like Reverend Manning is super interesting and I'm glad we covered him but I don't

101
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Thinkers value

102
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Covering him anymore

103
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Prison

104
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
Project Camelot does not Charmy anymore I'm not sure exactly how interesting it is to cover any more of that

105
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,015
A lot of people are in prison on that's that's really difficult I don't know what to do

106
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,599
And so to remedy that problem one of the things that I came up with was

107
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
Coasttocoastam

108
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
That's going to be a great idea

109
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
And I got to tell you

110
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,351
It was a better idea than it is in practice

111
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Ab Coaster

112
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:06,495
The coast and they're very boring most of the time they're very boring and not worth talking

113
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Yeah

114
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
So you end up

115
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
Eating tons of time it is preparation of things that go nowhere

116
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,735
You're sacrificing 15 hours for the possibility of

117
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:23,135
Maybe 10 minutes of our show being worth talking about I can't keep up

118
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
Now we're going to be able to do this

119
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
So in the second thing two is like I started

120
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
To realize as listen to more and more coasttocoastam

121
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Your George Noory sucks

122
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
He definitely sucks

123
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
Yep a bit of it subtle

124
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
The thing that you

125
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
It comes up much more

126
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Is like

127
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,103
Colors saying really stupid things

128
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
I don't want the

129
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Us to do

130
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Episodes about coasttocoastam where we're just like

131
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
Look at this dumbass

132
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,343
Shocking collars that holds no interest for me

133
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
Except for when they're Alex's callers in there

134
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Saying like

135
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Should we start shooting

136
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,559
Terrify

137
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,887
It just didn't feel like it would be satisfying and anyway like it's a it's a

138
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
The ton of work for very little

139
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,775
Content content will be like really

140
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:18,431
Not what I'm comfortable with what I want our show to be so that is turned me off a bit on the eye

141
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Idea Coast-to-Coast we need something else

142
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
And I realized

143
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
What is what interests

144
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Like what is something that I

145
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
Think is going to be in line with the show interesting

146
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Add to everything

147
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,351
And the only thing I can come up with and the only thing I really want to do

148
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
I want to talk about Bill Cooper

149
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,079
Just fit more in line I was way off I want to talk about

150
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,175
William Milton Cooper

151
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,503
William Milton William Cooper

152
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
Really a good idea to go by Bill

153
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
Yeah Bill Cooper is a guy who is on shortwave radio for years and

154
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Is basically what you call the Prototype

155
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
And

156
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
He has

157
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Years

158
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
Worth of his radio show available

159
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Z93 when he started

160
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
The hour of the time

161
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
On wwcr shortwave radio

162
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
To his death

163
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
In 2001

164
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
And I think

165
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
That this

166
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Would be the Avenue

167
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
Beyond down which

168
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
We can find the most wackiness

169
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
The most relevance

170
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
And the most that I'm interested in

171
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
We're going back to the beginning

172
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,935
We're starting at the beginnings of this I wouldn't save the beginning because I think there's even further back

173
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,919
There are other things that probably are influences that maybe conscious subconscious

174
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
At least Oracle

175
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Irrelevant

176
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,343
And maybe that's something else we could do but I want to talk about Bill Cooper

177
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
I've been listening to a bunch of

178
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
And it's it's fascinating to

179
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
To me because

180
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
For the last

181
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
You know weeks

182
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,583
I've been listening to his show in addition to

183
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
To listening to Alex

184
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
Show in the present

185
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
That's why it's just

186
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
Depressing

187
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
It has to be

188
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
It's so staggering to see the difference

189
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Between like

190
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,687
This guy who is at the top of his game doing the shortwave militia show in 93

191
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
Alex and 2019

192
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
Does the Dead the juxtaposition is

193
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Almost unsettling

194
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
Bad Alex

195
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,791
So what I've got for you today Jordan

196
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
Is we're going to be listen

197
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
OoVoo

198
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Premier Apple

199
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Episode okay

200
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,495
The time

201
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Is that what's happened

202
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Very little

203
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
Bill Cooper had been on some form of

204
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Pirate Radio for about a decade

205
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Up to this point already

206
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
This is considered the

207
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
First episode of his more mainstream

208
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
The legendary

209
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
The hour of the time

210
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,671
On January 4th 1993 Bill began airing weeknight

211
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Saint wwcr

212
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
I believe it was 11

213
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Hawkcentral

214
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,399
I was at Wendy's Sherwood are at the Primo time slot

215
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
Exactly where you want to do

216
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
So w.w.

217
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Ccr's probably larger

218
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
Shortwave radio station in the country

219
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,967
Broadcast out of Nashville and the shows to be heard all over the United States

220
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,063
It brought Bill Cooper to a much wider audience than he had had previous

221
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,207
Wwcr is also the shortwave station that got into a business relationship with Genesis

222
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
The communications Network eventually ended up Aaron

223
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
I don't think so but it's 1993

224
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:53,215
2 years before Alex ever was a bill is on the shortwave station

225
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
Rod knocking it out of the park

226
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
Bring in the militia Community to

227
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
To the world

228
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
Build a gigantic topic

229
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
And from the amount of the shows that I've listened

230
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
I think

231
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
It's very complicated figure

232
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
He's the one with the

233
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Orangeview

234
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
Yeah on many topics

235
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,743
But he's also a person who is Miles Ahead of the right-wing on some topics

236
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
You would not expect

237
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
Okay alright I find it very interesting

238
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Right when I look at it as is I think he's a human

239
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
As opposed to someone like Alex who's full of

240
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
Yeah yeah

241
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
And in many ways bad

242
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Person

243
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Yellow person

244
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
It's so much more

245
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Yeah Alex

246
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,135
Is more of a constructed this better many things that I know about Bill and there's many things that I don't know about him

247
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
And I don't want to let

248
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Those

249
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Color

250
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
What the topic it were talking about today

251
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
So today is about this episode

252
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
So we'll talk about what he brings up in this episode

253
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Are plenty of other things like

254
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
I could say hey this show is interesting it's would like

255
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,359
Well what about his age denial

256
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,759
That's something to talk about on

257
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,879
If you think we're defending it

258
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
The shop

259
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
This is the this is the premiere this is the first episode

260
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
January 4th

261
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Every show his

262
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Starts

263
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,471
With air raid sirens and dogs barking and terrifying

264
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,311
Soundscape okay

265
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,631
Very upsetting

266
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:04,031
I want to pause here really

267
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,127
Fast because it's just go on but it it's very interesting to me that in the last

268
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,455
Couple months at least and probably a little bit further back than that

269
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Alex has been coming out of brakes

270
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
Sometimes with just air raid siren

271
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
It's very reminiscent of

272
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
The beginning of Bill Cooper's hour of the time

273
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
This was recorded at Disneyland

274
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,623
I don't do goes on a while

275
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Stop

276
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
All over the world

277
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Hugo award

278
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
From here on

279
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Go to your leaders

280
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Tell you the truth

281
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Toward the mark

282
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
The world

283
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
Vlog

284
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Chipotle

285
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
All

286
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
40 News

287

Worldwide

288
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Democracy

289
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
Supposedly is doing a lot of work in that shirt

290
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,607
First episode of his mouth starting this new show on wwcr

291
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
The premise is

292
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
You see the dropping of the Iron Curtain all of this it's

293
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,871
All in service of a one world democracy of world government

294
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Is dudes all about

295
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
So

296
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,807
Look the problem in the world it seems external but really

297
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
It's it within

298
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Each and everyone of us

299
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Alright

300
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Seville

301
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Drops that on us

302
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
And then

303
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Man

304
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
This guy

305
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
What what I would have brought

306
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
But don't get down

307
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
Hope all is not lost

308
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
The problem lies within

309
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
There are multiple my

310
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
The answer

311
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
William Cooper at your listing

312
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Albert r

313
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:32,255
Air raid siren.

314
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:51,455
They are all lying to you about this song

315
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,183
For the listeners DNA's lips

316
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
A Cooper so much better

317
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
I wanted things I've noticed for listen

318
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,631
Listen to his shows that he's not afraid to make it show a multimedia

319
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Experience

320
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,519
Bill incorporates music into his show that has a theme attic connection to the topic that he's covering

321
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
They need to keep

322
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Preparation

323
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
It indicates intention

324
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,711
The other topic that he wants to cover and he's going to help drive his points on with artistic

325
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
In this case in his first episode of The Hour of the time Bill chose

326
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Open show

327
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
With you long-forgotten Beach Boys

328
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Quote-unquote hits

329
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Make it big

330
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
From The Troop Beverly Hills soundtrack

331
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
The song was also on their 1989 album Still cruising

332
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
Which was almost universally panned by critics

333
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Is being trash

334
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
The review on Rolling Stone open

335
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
This line quote

336
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
If you've been waiting for the Beach Boys to hit rock bottom the suspense is over

337
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Okay

338
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,295
That's that's a generous opening this is the album included their cover of Wipeout

339
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Featuring The Fat Boys

340
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
That gives you some idea what they were up to at that point

341
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,047
I'm prepping this episode I went back and watch that video for Wipeout

342
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,607
And I can report that it is embarrassing as I remember to be

343
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
Oh so they hadn't yet hit rock bottom

344
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
That was

345
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Part of it

346
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,031
Anyway the point here is that bill is the kind of broadcasters down to open

347
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
Can you show with a full song you play the full song

348
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
In order to set the mood

349
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
And I'm here to tell you

350
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Variant rules

351
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
This kind of thing honestly makes me super giddy

352
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,135
Spending so much time as I do studying Alex I'm like a man starving for someone who's

353
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Trying at the fact that bill open

354
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
When's the show like this is just awesome

355
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,791
Yeah the way I feel about Alex Jones that he's mostly checked out

356
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
He's going through the motions of trying to spend

357
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Conspiracy theories but he's too confused by his own ideas

358
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,959
He's in too deep but he doesn't even know what he's doing

359
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
He can't be bothered spend any time for parents who just yells convoluted nonsense on air plugs his pills gets a bit racist

360
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
Then screams about the literal devil for a while

361
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
It doesn't necessarily feel

362
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,111
Good demonstrate how he's wrong about stuff in 2019 it just feels kind of sad most of the time

363
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
The Bill Cooper

364
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
Here is a man deserving of my attend

365
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Here is a guy who is

366
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Trying to stop

367
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
Just short of saying that like Bill Cooper

368
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
But he's definitely much more serious

369
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
In a competent person an hour

370
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
And on some level I definitely admire that

371
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,031
Even if I disagree with just about everything I know he believes

372
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,175
Very close to you got to give it up to the Smalley pirates with no Dairy close to that. Got to go to the go Cooper

373
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,759
Is opening up his show with a f****** Beach Boy song make it big

374
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,879
I know it's probably confusing what I mean by thematic connection but you'll start to understand it as

375
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,975
As we go along the same response to you I was laughing

376
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
And I was like

377
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
Yeah yeah yeah

378
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Of course

379
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
It wasn't a long walk from Aries iren's and dogs barking and f***

380
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:58,335
Nazis marching

381
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
That's not long enough

382
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
Right and

383
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
I have to

384
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:08,063
Think that bill is in control of his showing outfits on shortwave yeah I wouldn't have

385
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
Cayo Largo

386
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,487
Egypt statues exactly how he wants to present the show and it's his first show

387
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,815
On this night

388
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Syndicated

389
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
Shortwave show

390
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
Lately

391
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
How am I going to prison

392
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
That myself

393
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
This is a

394
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
This is a statement song

395
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
Weirdly plausible that

396
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Dennis Wilson could like

397
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,991
A half axle half as backwards as way into being like hey

398
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
There's this new show if

399
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Got this really great host

400
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
You got to be on it

401
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
We just got to pay him a little bit

402
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,279
Just a little bit of touching

403
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
And I think it's

404
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Just great

405
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
This guy he gets

406
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Dinos

407
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
He knows how to do radio

408
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
And I admire

409
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Okay cuz I like right here

410
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
So the song end

411
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,615
And Bill gets down to introducing something it will be the

412
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
The theme of the episode

413
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
He doesn't get into it immediately

414
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,343
Again it's another great broadcasting trick the Alex thinks he's doing but he's not

415
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
Which is the bill introduces the subject

416
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
Talks about something else

417
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Then

418
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Really digs into the sub

419
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
Right Alex

420
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
Brings up and teases the subject

421
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Talk about other stuff then

422
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Forget about everything

423
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Yes thanks

424
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:32,032
He's gotten into the subject in fact has not really does believe that he's already taken

425
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
In care of it I think what Alex is doing is

426
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
Is almost bad photocopy

427
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,944
Of this sort of job

428
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
So here is Bill introduced

429
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,808
Send the subject that we will be getting into a little bit later

430
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
Call Paul the problem

431
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Are within us

432
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
And all the answers

433
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Are there any

434
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
U-Haul store

435
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Pirate weapons

436
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
Technology

437
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
From operations

438
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
Roo

439
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Strategy

440
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Practical methodology

441
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,600
Developed under the military men

442
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Broken English

443
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
During World War II

444
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
The first

445
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
View haircut ever

446
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Heard of it

447
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
We've got the keys

448
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
We have silent weapons

449
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,472
Technology has been developed by or operational research we've got this

450
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
And now

451
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Bill

452
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
Starts

453
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Speaking start

454
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Talking

455
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
About the show itself

456
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,784
It's going to be unlike anything you've ever heard in your life already he's got to Garrison Keillor

457
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
I find screwball much more attractive

458
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Listen to than Alex

459
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,512
Nonsense rambling feels also in the same vein as I was saying that he feels like a real person

460
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,328
The way he speaks feels like a real person

461
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Yeah

462
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,912
The Alex has all these affectation to his voice

463
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Things like this is

464
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Ridiculous

465
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
We've been making

466
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Tufano's lately all the

467
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,616
The fake passionatechat like all that stuff

468
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
When you listening to and where is Bill

469
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,504
He seems like he is directly communicating exactly how you would

470
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
If you were talking

471
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,344
There's something compelling about that as well

472
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
But this show

473
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Will be unlike any other

474
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
You ever heard

475
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
Who got the introduction to the thesis

476
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
And now we get into the witches what you're listening

477
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,864
Sing to it will be unlike anything you've ever heard almost a sales pitch

478
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
On the pilot episode

479
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
This is not

480
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
Any current

481
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,104
Radio program that you've never heard before in your life

482
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
For nothing is sacred here

483
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
On the line

484
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Around the bush

485
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
I'm going to tell you something

486
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
There's nobody here

487
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
It's afraid

488
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Do you want

489
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Anybody

490
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Criminal

491
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Interest

492
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
In a career in radio

493
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Hope you get thrown off the air

494
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Bother

495
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,336
Iroquois

496
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
Irregardless

497
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Of the pressure

498
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,064
This is why he started the show with naked pic

499
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
This is the theme attic

500
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
Like benizi silent weapon

501
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
But he's going to get to the store

502
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,864
The topic of the lecture as it were the other message that he wants to drive across

503
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Is served by almost

504
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,752
That song being farcical like the make it big

505
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:49,152
Is in service

506
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
It's so good so good

507
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,344
It's the opening of Pride and Prejudice

508
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,440
Say you open with that line isn't ironic aside yet

509
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
A real impact

510
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
It's like if you're a little

511
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
Oh that's why you played

512
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:12,448
That song or you don't notice it when you get the unit that subconscious exam

513
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,544
I'm going to get you get it but if not you might just like

514
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,872
McCook that Beach Boys album is terrible but that's all

515
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
So

516
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
Bill gets down to his standard

517
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Admonition

518
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
30 gives people

519
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
And that is

520
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Don't trust

521
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,136
Anything that you here not even on my shirt

522
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,440
I love it before I go any farther though

523
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Where you have to

524
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
To give you my scanner Dad when I send it all goes well

525
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072

Inception

529
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Fourth of May 9th

530
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
We already know that

531
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664

532
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,040
So I'm going to give you this admonition

533
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
No matter what

534
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,208
Not believe anything

535
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
What you hear on this show

Anyone else

542
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,992
This entire world what you hear it on the radio or on television are from the

543
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
If someone

544
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
In front of you

545
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
Virtue

546
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
Listen to

547
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,464
Everyone no matter who they are or what

548
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
They aren't real

Listen to everything believe nothing until you can

553
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
You yourself

554
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
You must

555
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Learn

556
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
How to find

557
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
The truth

558
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Improve it

559
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,344
If you can't do that you might as well turn off your radio

560
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
If you have to call someone else to ask

561
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Today Show

562
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
Turn off your radio

563
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
Now

564
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:20,192
So when he said that he's on wwcr

565
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,520
Before

566
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Michelle but not weakness

567
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,616
Every weeknight

568
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
1808

569
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Still a figure

570
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,480
Here before like Behold a Pale Horse

571
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
His big book was published in 91

572
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
Wrapping a gigantic

573
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Stick figure

574
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Since at least I point

575
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Even before that

576
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
But this is the

577
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
Launch of the nightly show

578
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
So just to clarify

579
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
I heard that is like what

580
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Hey White

581
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
He's telling people not to believe anything

582
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
Mentalities absolutely Universal

583
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
Conspiracy theory community

584
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,360
But something I find really interesting is how it plays out differently depending on the personalities

585
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Of each individual

586
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Conspiracy theories

587
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
For instance the way Alex presents this is by saying that everything you saying has been proven salty classified in the white papers

588
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
Just made it go ahead look it up

589
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,952
He's basically suggesting that if you don't agree with him your uninformed

590
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,512
And if you go ahead and do the research he's done

591
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
You'll get up to speed and recognize that he's right

592
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,936
It's a strategy that's deployed to make his audience the last likely to actually do that research into steaks

593
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,984
Stephanie might be right or you must be right

594
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,568
There's no way you'd be so insistent that I researched these things

595
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,968
If you knew that when I did I realize he's making s*** up just a bluff I was thinking the exact same thing

596
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,832
Is the inverse of Alex saying everything

597
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
You go look it up

598
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,512
A bills position is like at you like you're saying it's a little different but ultimately the effect I think it has on it audio

599
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
I agree

600
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
If he's on are saying that you shouldn't

601
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
Anyone says without researching it on your own

602
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:00,288
Kind of stands to reason that he himself wouldn't trust anything he hears without researching it on his own

603
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
If you think bills

604
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:07,712
Credible at all I'll probably subconsciously except those research is good enough

605
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,320
Text telling people to be skeptical of everyone as a way of getting people to only trust you

606
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
It's an authenticity of shortcut

607
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
Based on some of the stuff we're going to get into later

608
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
I don't believe the bill practices what he preaches

609
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,096
The other thing the bills doing gear saying that if you aren't going to prove things for yourself

610
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
He doesn't want you listening to the show

611
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,984
This has the effect of creating an inflated sense of self in the audio

612
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
Bill is straight-up telling all the dumb followers to stop listening so by definition if I keep listening I must not be one

613
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,992
Exactly creates an imaginary us-versus-them of like

614
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
You insulate the audience of this I give you are

615
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
Still listening that you must

616
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
Be one of the

617
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,440
Champion truth

618
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
Producers

619
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
You've researched

620
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
Everything yeah

621
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
So I may I think I think

622
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
The strategy employed

623
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
I don't know how much that

624
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Conscious strategy

625
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,008
But that is the effect that you have on people with that sort of thing

626
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
I think what's

627
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Interesting about that like

628
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
But that statement he made of

629
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,992
Don't trust anything anybody says without having research yourself and all of those things

630
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,832
All of that sounds on a surface level 2B

631
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
Fairly good advice you know

632
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,720
A skeptical mind you should be capable of critically researching everything

633
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,304
Thanks yeah but at the same time within that statement is the

634
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Stuff that makes it impossible

635
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
Like if you can't trust

636
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Anyone

637
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,704
On anything

638
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,056
Exactly then you're you're going to lose your mind especially if you take the other piece

639
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,128
Advise that he hasn't as you have to listen to everybody

640
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:45,760
Believe anything that you will always be looking

641
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,576
And you got to consider to this is 93

642
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,904
That wasn't what it is today

643
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Actually

644
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,024
The audience getting into some of the stuff would be a lot more difficult than it is

645
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
Let's say for me

646
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
To go back home

647
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:07,008
E3 I probably couldn't do a show critically deconstructing what he's talking about cuz I couldn't get my hands

648
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,312
On some of the documents right that he's rapper

649
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,104
Now it's all been

650
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,432
Photocopied stand it's all online

651
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
The bottom like

652
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
This is bulshit

653
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,112
Yeah n93i imagine to that if you're the type of person who would tune into Bill Cooper show

654
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,416
The stuff that you would be looking up

655
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:30,816
Because of the limited availability of infinite knowledge would probably Hugh more towards the stuff that

656
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Reinforce

657
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Bill Cooper

658
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,960
A idea you might be driven toward certain data streams

659
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
Send that information

660
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Sources

661
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Like Patriot message boards and

662
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Like that that have

663
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
The appearance of confer

664
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Formation

665
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
I think that's probably

666
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
Strategic little Bill's Bar but on that larger communities fart for sure

667
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
Fascinating

668
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
That idea of you should listen

669
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
To everyone

670
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,488
Because you're going to trust

671
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Yourself more

672
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,096
The information that you are going to research and look into

673
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:08,192
Is going to most likely be counter to the narrative that you passively

674
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:12,288
Hear all around you that also kind of insulates you from

675
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
You know I am listening to everybody but what I'm looking

676
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Looking at which I think is more

677
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,944
Yeah

678
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:23,296
Is it something that I'm going to trust more than whatever the f*** Dan Rather

679
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Yeah yep

680
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,392
All that is that is in the mix

681
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
So

682
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
We get back

683
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
Back to build not wanting

684
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
How to make it big

685
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
I

686
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,352
Expounds on this a little bit more and hear some fairly

687
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Familiar

688
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Refrain

689
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
I told you

690
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,288
It was not a radio broadcast

691
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
Ever heard or ever will

692
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,456
You see most radio personality

693
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
Simplest form mean

694
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
Teen Mom

695
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,856
I'm going up the ladder career-wise

696
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
And making a lot of money

697
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
None of those pictures

698
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,280
Prevail here I can assure you

699
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Power Rangers

700
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
Are in Saving

701
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Freedom

702
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
For the world

703
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
For the world

704
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Play the Constitution

705
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
Of America

706
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
Tooth out sounds just like Alex

707
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Yeah but I believe him

708
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,880
I believe he believes it yeah that's where I

709
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:35,488
I believe there's an authenticity to him saying like I'm not looking

710
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
For money we're not trying to get rich here it's for krill oil

711
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Nn

712
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,216
And shitzo

713
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Bringing freedom

714
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
They're better.

715
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Presentation

716
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
From Bellaire

717
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Do you strengthen

718
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
Rich no I agree I think you would have behaved

719
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
Much differently if he was

720
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Tom and Jerry

721
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
He's not I think you would have died

722
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Difference

723
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,256
So he's gotten his we're not trying to make it

724
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,560
Speedo out of the way and now we get to the

725
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,912
The pieces already been introduced there's these silent weapon

726
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Amanda

727
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
We now enter the lecture for

728
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Continue

729
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
Technology

730
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,992
Preferably

731
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
Develop

732
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Operation

733
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Research

734
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Found out that

735
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
Recognize

736
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
Titles and positions

737
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Coward at the same methods might

738
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Useful for total

739
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Better tools

740
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
Alright so silent weapons I'm assuming we're no longer talking about silencers on

741
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,176
No certainly not now this is much much larger than that

742
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Insidious

743
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,504
I'm going to go with

744
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
They need a better tool

745
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
Turns out what they needed in order to

746
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
To achieve this

747
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,768
Control over the entire population turns out

748
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
It was

749
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352

00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Constantly changing

00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
What arrived

762
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Electronica

763
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Computer invented

John W mousley

766
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Still bill

767
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:57,056
So bill is clearly reading something here like first time through this because I was like

768
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
Absolutely he's reading something I'm not sure what it is

769
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
Go get to that later

770
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,712
For now it's just relevant to point out that will bill is expressing

771
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,296
When is that in order to control Society the elites needed to create

772
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,648
Computers we could process data and tell where things were going in the future

773
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,512
So they could plan ahead and be ready for the point when Society catches up with their predictive calculator

774
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Right

775
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
Alex talks about this a lot

776
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
He often makes

777
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,680
Obscure references to actuaries and how the globalist use there too

778
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
Computer system

779
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Using social me

780
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Media to predict

781
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,056
The futures of the be able to know what to do with advanced

782
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:34,176
I have almost no doubt that he's taking it from the same Source the bill is currently reading

783
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:37,248
From because I've never heard Alex give a real source

784
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,856
It doesn't match up with the reality that I understand from what I've looked into the field of like

785
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,184
Modeling tistical modeling

786
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,512
So I I find this to be another real thing

787
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
Ematic piece

788
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:56,192
All of Alex's stuff that I've never really understood but you're hearing it echoed in the show from 93

789
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
Yeah Bill does give sources

790
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,312
Yeah so what I'm finding already

791
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
The pattern that I'm picking up here just a little bit

792
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Is

793
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
He is much more likely

794
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
To put a solid

795
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,552
Kernel of something that you do agree with

796
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,112
Surrounded by and you know

797
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Globalist so you know

798
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,464
Well that's like Alex doesn't work

799
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,560
Conspiracy theorists 22

800
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
Competent

801
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
Conspiracy theories start from a place of like a universal truth

802
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Translate

803
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
We all feel like so

804
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Something's wrong

805
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
And

806
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
Here's why

807
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,408
And this was only a year after the Unabomber so distressing technology is right on board

808
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
For this group of folks sure but this actually has nothing

809
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,760
Things to do with the Unabomber and Southern

810
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
Far more obscure

811
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
Google get into it

812
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Just be you up Almer

813
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
So with silent weapons

814
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
These Elites

815
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,024
Are able to carry out

816
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,072
What's known as a quiet War

817
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
The population

818
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
And what do you know

819
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
It started

820
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
It 1954

821
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
It was carried out by

822
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
A name that's very familiar

823
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,360
The quiet War work

824
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
International

825
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
Everybody meeting held in 90

826
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,480
54

827
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:22,976
So now this is something interesting because I was talked about had no one was talking about the Bilderberg Group before he came along and started

828
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:28,096
Exposing this stuff this is two years before Alex was ever on air here is Bill Cooper directly saying

829
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,960
The guys who started a silent war in 1954 were the Bilderberg Group

830
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
Alex's

831
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,312
All of the things that he takes credit for are all things

832
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:41,920
They either Bill Cooper or the larger Patriot Community was already

833
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Open arms

834
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
About

835
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Before Alex got on air

836
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,064
The legacy of this guy

837
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
That's brutal it is

838
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,696
It is I mean I don't want to lionizer or like

839
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Turn

840
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,280
Bill into some kind of hero but like

841
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,680
He got done Dirty by Alex

842
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
Not going to be like you stole his legacy and that's bad

843
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
You can be a bad person in

844
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
And still get done wrong

845
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Yeah that's what I see here

846
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,296
So the Bilderberg Group CSS food

847
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
Is he human this

848
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
Food

849
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
Let's talk about all the time

850
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
We're cattle they just want to just eat us

851
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,792
Moral issues were raised

852
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,120
In view of the law of natural selection

853
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,912
It was agreed

854
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,008
Are world of people who will not use their

Always have been

862
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
Always will be

863
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
Consequently

864
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
In the interest of future world order

865
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608

Ed worthey

878
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
So you picking up why what's going on here

879
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:32,512
Yeah but I'm just so distracted I don't want to compliment this guy but he's such a better broadcaster that

880
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
Immediately after that first line

881
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,608
Pause was the right length of time

882
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,936
It was just so it's such a good part

883
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
He's going to do

884
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Yeah right here

885
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
Like I said the beginning there's intention behind what he's doing as opposed to reactive flailing when I see from Alec

886
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
Right I don't want a

887
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,992
I'm going to try that is broadcasting

888
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
Cuz he's obviously certainly he

889
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
He's a more serious person

890
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
What do you mean the steaks on the table

891
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Okay okay

892
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
Obviously he's reading something

893
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,328
He will say what it's from

894
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
Talk about

895
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
But for now

896
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,728
Something okay you're keeping us in suspense reading something

897
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Okay

898
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
It's all about the silent weapon

899
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
Sure they're obvious

900
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,920
To the trained eye right but You & I we would

905
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416

Unmistakable to train

00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Windows what

912
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
The public

913
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:03,135
Cannot comprehend or cannot believe that they are being attacked

921
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,943
They do not know how to cry for help

922
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,271
I do not know how to associate with others to

923
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063

The public adjuster

927
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
This is classic

Conspiracies

929
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
There's this massive thing

930
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
Explain everything

933
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,287
This is just red pill rhetoric before the Matrix ever

934
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:57,407
It's an attempt to deal with a very real issue that that what you're talking about makes

935
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
No sense to anyone

936
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,711
It only makes sense

937
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Trained Observer

938
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,343
The second part of that clip is also pretty standard conspiracy manipulation

939
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
Already touched on

940
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
Minute ago

941
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,463
Every conspiracy generally starts from

942
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
Fairly Universal released a Feeling

943
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,095
Like it's universal truth

944
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,191
Many people feel like there's something wrong with the way Society is structured

945
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
There systemic problems

946
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
Keep power in the hands of a particular class

947
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,335
While the rest of us are left to play games with our boots

948
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
Everyone recognizes that's not fair

949
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,223
Another is probably a better way to go about things

950
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
They aren't sure what the cause of the problem is

951
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
And this is the feeling

952
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
Conspiracy theorist

953
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,719
By providing an answer to that fundamental question they're able to pass off anything they want

954
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
Is part of that explanation

955
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
Everyone feels like something's off but they can't quite put their fee

956
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,863
Synchronic the answer of course

957
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,703
Is a silent weapon system set up by the Bilderberg Group in 1954

958
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
That sounds right

959
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,079
There's a reason the Bill Cooper decided to cover this on this first episode on wwcr

960
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,639
The whites the subject of the first chapter

961
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
Of his book Behold a Pale Horse

962
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Which is

963
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,063
God's Own book

964
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,927
It's the first chapter of his book that's actually a republishing of something else

965
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,487
The Mysteries still not entirely solved

966
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
And the reason he's doing this

967
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Because it's something

968
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Like a thesis

969
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
This is what's at the root of a lot of his

970
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
Conspiracy

971
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
The explanation for why things aren't the way they should be in society it's a silent weapon system that's being too

972
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:34,431
Floyd and you can even hear so many wrinkles and shades of Alex in there

973
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,015
Supply gradually humans address

974
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,551
Alex talks about that all the time

975
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
All the time

976
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:46,975
Talk about meeting with globalist or like a publical acclimate to

977
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Everything

978
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
King is just like oh wow

979
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
All of these ideas

980
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
They're all just

981
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Repackage

982
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
So

983
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,959
You know we're talkin about this this

984
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Things

985
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,823
People like Bill and Alex are able to manipulate from

986
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,127
The starting point of feeling like something

987
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Wrong

988
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,967
And what do you know Bill meets a lot of people who feel that way

989
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,807
The reason why would I travel around this country

990
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
Did you get my messages

991
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
Find me

992
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
Do people come up to me and say

993
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,815
Terribly wrong

994
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
Don't know

995
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
And that's why

996
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
Everybody is waiting George

997
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Realizing

998
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
Who is the same

999
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,271
What's this very are what's this

1000
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,111
All political parties of the same they're all controlled by

1001
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Cool

1002
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
7 that's pretty pretty theme attic to

1003
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,023
And it was things is like on the right wing

1004
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,607
You ever want imagines that everybody is his partisans

1005
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Angop

1006
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:05,055
Right but these large figureheads of the butts particularly in The Patriot militia vein

1007
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Are certainly not

1008
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,407
Yeah it's just government it doesn't matter who's in there

1009
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,479
It's simply the fact of governments

1010
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,807
It remains to be seen if they would ever like a president

1011
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,159
Yeah like maybe there are Presidents in history that they've enjoyed more than others

1012
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Jackson baby

1013
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:27,327
But they are certainly In Our Lifetime all of them have been bad

1014
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,655
Like really a tragedy is

1015
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,543
Because Bill Cooper died in 2001 we have no idea what he would have thought of trump

1016
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,359
Like I really write the Mind reels

1017
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,919
I don't think you would have been onboard I think you would have been

1018
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
A voice

1019
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
Very strong like

1020
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
F*** this

1021
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
Yeah I mean

1022
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,087
Anything 20 years ago

1023
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
20 years is a long time

1024
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
I just don't know

1025
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
We can't know

1026
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,511
But I do think

1027
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
That if

1028
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Trump

1029
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,351
Was elected in 2012

1030
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
Alex would have stayed again

1031
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Yes that's what I

1032
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
You you're probably right but I think also that it you're right it is it is very difficult to tell because I think if you

1033
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
You would have

1034
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:19,039
Cast at another point in time you would have said Alex never would have done that

1035
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
Years of the principals don't mean anything maybe I'm just imagining the bills convictions were much

1036
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
Stronger than they actually are

1037
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,023
He sounds like he feels like yeah

1038
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
He died because of

1039
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,983
Is refusal to pay taxes around being a real gun dick

1040
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
Yeah that that is interesting

1041
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:45,919
I would be interested because I think I'm more interested to know how he would have dealt with

1042
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
The years of w

1043
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,527
Sure, I'm more interested in that kind of

1044
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
Situation

1045
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,391
I mean we got a couple months of it

1046
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,999
Yeah baby before he dies about his approach

1047
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
Zombie butt

1048
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
We'll see

1049
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:06,399
So in the next Clipper Bill reveals the source material of what he's talk

1050
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,703
Erasing our world

1051
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
Intelligence

1052
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
Are no better than animals

1053
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
30 people are beast of burden

1054
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
Jake's on the table by

1055
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Choice

1056
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,575
You fit that category called

1057
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
I certainly hope

1058
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
Because I believe

1059
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,463
Get ourselves out of this

1060
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,559
Situation if we will just open our eyes out here

1061
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Wake up

1062
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
Stop bleeding

1063
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
What you told what you read

1064
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
Give me to find

1065
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
For yourself

1066
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,799
What are you doing

1067
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
Giving you

1068
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Half hour

1069
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Is just

1070
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
A couple of pages

1071
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
Out of the first chapter of my book

1072
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Airport

1073
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
Animal shelter are puppies

1074
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
A document

1075
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Entitled silent weapon

1076
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
For quiet Wars

1077
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,023
An introductory programming manual operation

1078
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Call Manuel

1079
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,679
F.w. 7905

1080
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,311
One of

1081
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
The document

1082
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
That was prepared

1083
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Subjugation

1084
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
America

1085
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Start a secret

1086
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
Power

1087
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Group

1088
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
Who Wants to Rule the World

1089
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,463
Dispensary

1090
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,095
So a lot of the beginning of this episode has to do with Bill reading from the first chapter of behold a Pale Horse

1091
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
Which he lays out his pieces

1092
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
Largely the foundation for this world

1093
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
According to builders an evil group of Elites were waging a war

1094
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
It's called The Quiet War

1095
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Against the pub

1096
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
Like mostly apparently

1097
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
To control the

1098
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,687
They want to completely predictable economy

1099
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:58,527
And the only way to do that is to remove any instability or chaos from the public

1100
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,391
The best means to achieve that is entirely pacifier domesticate everyone to the point where

1101
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
Even thinking of straying from the path

1102
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,463
Is unthinkable

1103
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:12,095
As the story goes in 1954 choir war was launched by people like the Rockefellers

1104
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,935
The Bilderberg Group along with elements of the government in order to achieve this goal

1105
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,239
This story is largely based

1106
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,543
On a document that's taking on Mythic import

1107
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
Anti-government militia world

1108
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,407
A document I've heard Alex reference many many times

1109
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,199
Even to the present day

1110
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,527
Like I heard him references document maybe a week ago

1111
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
It's called

1112
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Silent weapon

1113
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
For quiet Wars

1114
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
And Bill Cooper founded on 4chan

1115
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:44,351
May 1979 the document is meant to Mark the 25th anniversary of the launch of the quiet

1116
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
And to describe how said war is

1117
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
What strategies it employed

1118
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,847
And exactly what techniques have been used in carrying out this war

1119
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,503
Right off the bat

1120
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,087
This just the premise of this should be a gigantic red flag

1121
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:09,439
And I thought that you just yelled Pez dispenser because it is very similar to the way

1122
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:14,047
The protocols of the Elders of Zion makes no sense

1123
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
You can argue that this document was that

1124
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,423
To be top secret and all that but in what world does a

1125
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:25,055
Super Evil cabal put together a document that lays out literally all of their evil plans to enslave Humanity

1126
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:28,895
Just to Mark the 25th anniversary of this plan B

1127
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,455
Motivation makes no sense

1128
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
If you consider the actor that play

1129
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
Childish

1130
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,111
Stole the PowerPoint presentation

1131
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,975
Write the conference where they all are agreed that we're going to do this evil play

1132
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:47,071
To murder all the people or I got you next slide

1133
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,935
I got out

1134
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Oh no

1135
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,055
Put simply I do not believe that a group that was able to speak

1136
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Control the world

1137
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,103
For 25 years

1138
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
Would also be

1139
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
A group of decide

1140
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,943
Like to celebrate that achievement by

1141
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,527
We are riding how they've been secretly controlling the world for 25 years

1142
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,367
Any group that would do the latter would be by definition ink

1143
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,159
Incapable of carrying out the prior

1144
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Just does not make sense

1145
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:19,071
So Bill claims that he'd seen this document back in his days working in Navy intelligence

1146
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:25,727
In fact he backs up a lot of his claim to the pills to having seat or being aware of things through his time in that branch of the service

1147
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,567
It's unclear if Bill was actually in Navy intelligence

1148
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,175
But he definitely was a sergeant in the Navy and did serve in Vietnam and Saucon play

1149
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
Combat

1150
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,343
He got to service Metals in 1969 but beyond these facts the rest of the story just comes from billing self

1151
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:46,463
He's claimed that he was discharged in 1975 but it's really hard to tell what

1152
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Real and what's embellished

1153
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:54,655
Given that it ate it's definitely true that he's not making up his service and that he was in Vietnam I'm going to err on the side of

1154
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
Not questioning his time in uniform

1155
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
And just believe him

1156
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,775
Four at the most

1157
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,823
Yeah this is no Stevie peas.and.

1158
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
We're letting this one.

1159
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,687
It does not appear that he is just making s*** up

1160
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,527
However there's a problem with his claim that he saw a copy of Silent weapon

1161
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,087
Things for quiet Wars while he was a Navy intelligence

1162
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,135
And that is why he did not exist

1163
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
Before he was discharged

1164
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
Because it's

1165
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,327
1979 was in his written he was discharged The 1975

1166
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,983
I suppose you could say that the actual document of the 25th anniversary edition he saw an older version of it

1167
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,615
First edition it was signed by Rockefeller worth millions I should tell you

1168
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,663
There is no older version

1169
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Of course.

1170
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,271
In 2003 a man named Hartford Van Dyke

1171
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,319
Tomato very credible claim to have

1172
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,111
Silent weapons for quiet Wars

1173
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,695
The document has been featured in a magazine called paranoia

1174
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,767
And haven't read their article VanDyke reached out to them by letter

1175
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:59,679
It turns out that he'd already revealed himself as the author of the text on the radio show in 1996 but people didn't really take note

1176
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:04,799
And if you look at the surrounding details it seems very likely that he was the author

1177
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:10,943
Especially when you consider the apocryphal story that goes around for how the document

1178
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,271
In 1986 a publication called America's

1179
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,831
Promise newsletter published in Arizona

1180
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
Where Bill Cooper live

1181
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,183
Printed silent weapons for the first time

1182
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:25,023
It's probably worth pointing out that this newsletter was published by Lord's covering

1183
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,327
Church with Pastor Sheldon Emery

1184
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,143
Was a high-profile follower of the Christian identity movie

1185
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:34,751
My day we got weird how they keep popping up all over the place

1186
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,519
They're like herpes

1187
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Haha

1188
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:42,687
In the intro to the document they say it was quote founded and IBM copier that was purchased at a surplus sale

1189
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:49,599
I'm sorry what's for this document

1190
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,903
Rockefeller Bilderberg plan

1191
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,719
So how well did way up in a f****** garage

1192
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
Sale

1193
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
Surplus sales

1194
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,071
It's important

1195
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
It's a surplus sale because the implication

1196
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,655
Is it a cop they purchased

1197
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,727
Does copier from the McChord Air Force Base which is nearby

1198
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,263
I'm at the cellar.

1199
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
Just been too sloppy

1200
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
To remove the world

1201
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:15,967
Conspiracy demonstrated document they just copied begin put tray

1202
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:22,367
Leave that like it like somebody removing their wallpaper and finding a hole with Nazi Treasures right right it's like that's not how

1203
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:28,767
You want that's the story that they want to ruin your brain

1204
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:34,399
It's nonsense it's an absurd story but one that's very similar to other origin stories for bulshit

1205
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
Documents

1206
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
So many of these things have

1207
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
Completely nonsense origin

1208
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:42,847
Like have so many of Larry Nichols official documents are just things he founded his mailbox

1209
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,127
Ever giving out his

1210
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,175
Address on Alex Jones Show a bunch

1211
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,479
Yeah I got to Larry Nichols

1212
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,503
Ridiculous figure

1213
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
Just silly

1214
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,367
I mean the same thing as the background story for

1215
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,695
For the absolute

1216
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
That story is likely not true

1217
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,839
But the story than Hartford Van Dyke tells is a bit more plausible

1218
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,679
And that is that he was a real Sovereign citizen tape weirdo back in the 70s

1219
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:12,543
Who is preoccupied with the idea that Roosevelt had foreknowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor

1220
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,823
And allowed it to happen.

1221
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
U.s. into World War II

1222
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,151
This weirdly

1223
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,687
Came up on our last episode from

1224
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,991
The present-day of Alex Jones where he was

1225
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,527
False flag

1226
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:28,927
I swear to God you're a demon has already touched on this a little bit narrative was popularized in 1940

1227
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:33,279
34th chapter book came out called the truth about Pearl Harbor by John Flynn

1228
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,839
Which definitely had a big impact on Van Dyke

1229
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,959
Refresh your memory Flynn was a major player in the group called The America First committee

1230
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,775
Which I'm pissed off cuz I'd listened back door last episode

1231
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,311
I kept saying America First Commission

1232
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,871
Delano America first

1233
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:52,223
Committee there were group who Master anti-Semitism and support for fascism by calling

1234
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
Auntie intervention

1235
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,063
You probably be unfair to say the organization was

1236
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
Pro Hitler

1237
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,391
But they definitely were pretty vocal about how they weren't

1238
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
Anti-hitler enough to think that good

1239
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
People around the world

1240
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Navigation to fight

1241
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Yeah

1242
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,791
America First Committee of dissolved

1243
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,375
When the US entered World War with the people involved in the organization

1244
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
Just give up on their goals

1245
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,959
And one of them was to paint us involvement

1246
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
In the wars being apart of the

1247
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
Conspiracy

1248
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
This large

1249
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,591
You scratch the surface but most

1250
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
Conspiracy theories

1251
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
Outnet fashion

1252
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Seem to keep

1253
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Popping up

1254
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
Kind of weird

1255
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:27,295
So this guy VanDyke according his telling of it lived in Hawaii

1256
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,623
Where is father's uncle had Direct involvement in the event of Pearl Harbor

1257
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:37,535
He told him about how Roosevelt had three dissenting military officials held at gunpoint until the attack it happened to prevent their ability to

1258
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,071
Sound the alarm

1259
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,215
Van Dyke wrote a book called The Skeleton and Uncle Sam's closet about these another Pearl Harbor Revelations

1260
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,287
Presumably self-published Back in 1970

1261
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,335
Around this time

1262
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:53,151
And I got his hands on a little book called a report

1263
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,967
From Iron Mountain on the possibility and desirability of

1264
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:00,063
Which conspiracy theorist believe is an official secret government report

1265
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,087
About how it wouldn't

1266
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,879
Good for the country to enter

1267
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,903
. of long

1268
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,183
Peace

1269
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:09,791
The document itself the Iron Mountain document was released in 1967

1270
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,071
Anna 1970

1271
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
Me to a man named Leonard Lewis

1272
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,935
Came out revealed that he had written that report and it was mad

1273
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Is it working

1274
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,007
Political satire about how absurd

1275
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
Think tanks are

1276
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,591
Simply put it was a hoax

1277
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
1 vets

1278
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,991
Suddenly probably became 100-percent real from some dumb thing to

1279
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:35,391
I don't know about that but if you can't breathe

1280
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
Later I think tank came out with the exact

1281
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,511
In 1990 the Liberty Lobby

1282
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,863
The organization founded by outright Neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier Willis carto

1283
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,167
We can't selling copies of that book

1284
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,447
The Iron Mountain report

1285
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:53,055
This prompted Luanne to sue the Liberty Lobby for infringing his intellectual property rights

1286
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,127
A suit that he would have won accepted Liberty Lobby wanted

1287
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
To settle out of court

1288
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
And agreed to pay luena

1289
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
Stop selling his book

1290
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:04,575
They likely settled because Lou and definitely had proof that he had in fact written this report

1291
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
It's considered one of the most

1292
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,671
Successful literary literary hoaxes of all time

1293
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:12,767
And no serious person who has looked into it believes that it's real in any way

1294
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:17,119
So anyway VanDyke right about half of this fake report from Iron Mountain

1295
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
It started to put

1296
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
Together

1297
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,239
Ultimately leads to the inspiration behind silent weapon

1298
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
Sims for quiet Wars

1299
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
A very large part of

1300
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,359
Primary list of sources for silent weapons

1301
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Is references to the report from Iron Mountain

1302
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
A literary hooks

1303
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,015
In many ways silent weapons is itself

1304
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,415
Represent itself as an official internal document being used by people within the secret government program

1305
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,463
The Familiar Eyes new initiate

1306
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
It's into their program

1307
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
It's clearly not

1308
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,583
To the extent that people believe that it's a real document

1309
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
They're falling for a hoax

1310
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,167
Although there's a very important to stinks

1311
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,191
Between this hoax

1312
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
And that of Iron Mountain

1313
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
And that's a difference of intent

1314
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,847
Luann Road Iron Mountain is a piece of satire

1315
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,663
To make people consider how absurd the arms race is

1316
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:06,015
And how we should consider the ways we could as a society transition to stable

1317
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
Peacetime economy

1318
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,111
It's a lampooning meant to make the reader think

1319
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,671
Conversely VanDyke wrote this hoax.

1320
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:17,023
To try and trick people into thinking that there was actually a secret government program that have been in place

1321
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
54

1322
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,839
Enslave the population

1323
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,143
To the author it wasn't Santa

1324
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,703
It was an expression of something totally real

1325
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
And his intent was to

1326
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
Persuade the reader to adopt

1327
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
His view of the

1328
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,567
So

1329
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
So his

1330
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,895
Motivation in writing that's

1331
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
Specific piece

1332
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
Was

1333
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
2

1334
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,527
Falstaff was to pass it off as a real doc you

1335
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,831
Okay so then

1336
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
That's

1337
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,415
That's strange to me

1338
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,975
I guess I guess what he is he's not

1339
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,999
Cuz I feel like

1340
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
If you

1341
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
Sing it together from other b*******

1342
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:57,215
What do you mean

1343
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:02,079
This is what the enemy's plan is and has always been right

1344
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
And then

1345
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,639
Passing it off

1346
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,943
As an official document from them

1347
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,247
Then you have to know you're lying

1348
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
Please write

1349
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
Probably say I am

1350
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:18,207
Lying in presentations what I'm saying is true to an extent that it doesn't matter

1351
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:23,071
They've no one will take it seriously if I don't resent it this way but what I'm saying is true

1352
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,143
So I presented this way in order to make a splash

1353
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,983
But it's it's a fundamental deceit

1354
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,775
Even from his part

1355
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,591
In order to achieve the outcome that he

1356
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
Desires

1357
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
But it's

1358
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
It's ridiculous

1359
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
If you read it it's just like

1360
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,039
Who would fight

1361
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,063
F****** believe that

1362
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,879
Like One giveaway for anyone reading silent weapon

1363
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,207
For quiet Wars something really should tip them off at the reading app

1364
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,767
Conspiracy theory rant as opposed to a secret government

1365
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
Product

1366
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
Is a section called

1367
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,607
Theoretical introduction

1368
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,727
Dissection begins with a most likely fabricated quote from Mayer amschel Rothschild

1369
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,663
The way this document obsesses over Rockefeller philanthropy and the Rothschild family is a gigantic red flag

1370
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
Good Providence

1371
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:16,063
A red flag that all these dumb dumb conspiracy theorists just seem to ignore like yeah absolutely

1372
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:21,951
Secret government programs would really talk about the Rothschilds a lot

1373
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:27,839
Another problem they overlooked is how this supposedly real document ends like this

1374
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Quote

1375
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,423
It left of those few who are truly willing to

1376
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,727
Nothing can survive is the fittest to survive

1377
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,311
To solve the problem for themselves as the few really care

1378
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,407
Otherwise exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope

1379
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,223
Preserving the seed of the future true Humanity

1380
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Dot-dot-dot

1381
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:49,855
This secret government documents

1382
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,975
Either that or the guy who's in charge of writing secret government documents

1383
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,791
Has a novel hidden always aware that he's afraid to public

1384
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:04,191
English major for the cartoon and he died while finishes

1385
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
The ellipses in blood

1386
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,591
The secret government document as delicious as particular

1387
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,663
It's just unbelievable that anyone read this and be like yeah that's

1388
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
Flo-Jo

1389
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
It's just scream

1390
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,015
Fake even if I had no idea that Van Dyke

1391
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
Made a pretty solid public case

1392
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
That he'd written it

1393
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:27,999
So the main premise of silent weapons for quiet Wars is that the elites want to completely predictable economy and so they use silent

1394
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,791
Train the population into

1395
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,327
Conforming to make them predictable

1396
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:36,447
Check these weapons are things like paper currency social welfare programs advertising

1397
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
Public education

1398
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,263
They're the input

1399
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
What's the government create

1400
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,591
Switch then produce their desired out

1401
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Like the government

1402
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,407
I controlling everything and everybody being

1403
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,247
It begins as just being about the economy

1404
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Document

1405
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,831
Before it's over at there's so many suggestions but

1406
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:59,231
Technology and teaching revisionist history that the reader comes away thinking of these alleged silent weapons could be just about

1407
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
Of course

1408
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,839
And this is why Alex will sometimes use this document as a

1409
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,375
When talking about things like

1410
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,935
Soft kill vaccines

1411
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,239
These are also silent weapon

1412
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:15,871
The unfocused nature what's being discussed allow this document to be used however the user wanted

1413
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,175
Which is another super awesome

1414
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,223
Feature of conspiracy theories

1415
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
It's a bit rangy

1416
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,599
And it doesn't really make sense as presented but that doesn't matter

1417
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:31,743
Haycock fire the Patriot militia anti-government circles because it confirmed what they already believe to be true

1418
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,303
Namely that the government has been carrying out a specific

1419
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Quiet war against

1420
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
The population

1421
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
A decade

1422
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
With the goal of enslavement

1423
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
Which can only be fought

1424
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,239
By fighting the government itself

1425
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,287
America's promise

1426
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,847
Newsletter published silent weapons

1427
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
To November

1428
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
18 * 86

1429
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:53,503
I meant Bill Cooper put it in his book Behold a Pale Horse published in 1991

1430
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,063
And from that point on it was conspiracy Cannon

1431
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:00,415
It definitely proved the existence of the secret evil government programs

1432
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,487
Involving Rockefeller philanthropy in the dreaded Rothschild

1433
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,279
But none of it's real

1434
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:09,119
It's just a work of a sovereign citizen who was tricked by a well-written piece

1435
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,399
Political satire

1436
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:16,287
When you get down to the bottom of these sources of information

1437
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
For the

1438
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,151
Larger umbrella of the worldviews that are put out by people like Bill

1439
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
And Alex

1440
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
You see like oh there's nothing here

1441
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:29,855
Yeah it's like if the onion was the reason we had Q

1442
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
Yeah I don't know

1443
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,951
I was always think of like this just

1444
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
Really

1445
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,071
Gets to me whenever you have a guy like Bill Cooper starting your show with

1446
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,679
It's all about if you know what to look for

1447
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,775
Know what you mean there is if you start with what you want to find

1448
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
And then start looking

1449
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:55,199
King for that you've trained your brain in a particular way to see certain things and now everything is filtered through that lens

1450
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,271
I'm like this is why I was saying what

1451
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,879
He's he's saying like you shouldn't trust anything unless you research it for yourself like I don't think

1452
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,903
You practice what you preach

1453
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,463
Because this is the first chapter of your book

1454
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,767
Silent weapons for quiet Wars you don't

1455
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:13,375
Like in 1993 sure Hartford VanDyke hadn't come out and said

1456
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
On that Radio Show in 96

1457
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,727
That he had created this document

1458
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,567
Whatever but even so if you read that

1459
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
You definitely need

1460
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,943
Much more concrete

1461
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
Proof

1462
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,015
And I find it hard to believe that

1463
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,295
Over that time span

1464
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
Nobody with a

1465
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
Hey critical I had look

1466
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:38,463
The other thing is that bill claims that when he was a naval intelligence

1467
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,999
Document they couldn't have

1468
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,327
Existed while he was in the Navy that part

1469
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,863
To me implies

1470
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399
You're making that up

1471
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,727
Which is which undercuts a lot of the author

1472
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
Intensity

1473
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,519
That I

1474
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:55,615
Fiocchi and body because there's also things like that

1475
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
Yeah what was

1476
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
That was that

1477
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Cool cloth

1478
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Meet up

1479
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:04,063
My my feel on that my read on that is

1480
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
No matter what you want to say

1481
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,647
You know like

1482
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:13,279
It requires a significant amount of ego for you and I to do this show just the idea of doing a show at all

1483
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:22,239
But whenever you are the font of all knowledge that requires a significantly larger

1484
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,567
Grandiosity to it

1485
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,847
When you're that grandiose

1486
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,151
It is impossible not to self

1487
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:36,063
I wouldn't doubt that he believes that he saw it but that was like a retroactive addition to

1488
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,671
You know like when you remember like when they do true-crime documentary and the neighbors like

1489
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:45,791
I remembered seeing all these weird things before it happened you're making that s*** up

1490
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
You're revising your own hair

1491
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,679
History yeah that's a problem probably a good point with these folks

1492
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
What's to like

1493
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,263
I know I experienced it was Alex a lot that's like

1494
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:59,359
You've told this story so many times that you perceive it to be true

1495
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,151
For sure so there's two more

1496
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,455
Important points that I need to bring up about this

1497
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
Silent weapons

1498
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
For quiet Wars

1499
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
And the author

1500
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,831
Hartford Van Dyke that I think are really

1501
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,855
Crucial to consider

1502
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:15,231
The first is that report from Iron Mountain wasn't the only thing that inspired vandyke's right sign

1503
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,583
From his letters to the editor of paranoia magazine

1504
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Quote

1505
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
In late October 9th

1506
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:27,007
1972 I met a man who gave me a copy of none dare call it conspiracy by Gary Allan

1507
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,311
The book inspired me to write my own book

1508
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,663
The book that he's referring to their is that book that he wrote about Pearl Harbor

1509
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:39,551
None dare call it conspiracy inspired Van Dyke to write his first absurd conspiracy book and then quote

1510
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,855
During the last phases of that books production

1511
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,391
I began reading a book

1512
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Call report

1513
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
From Iron Mountain

1514
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:49,023
According to his letters he only got halfway through report from Iron Mountain

1515
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,047
But then later

1516
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
He was reading a college algebra test

1517
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,375
Textbook for whatever reason

1518
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,215
And decided that the equations are similar to something he read in part of Iron Mountain

1519
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,031
It's a completely nonsensical path for him to take

1520
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:03,103
But that's what leads him to write silent weapons

1521
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:08,223
You read part of Iron Mountain then saw an algebraic equation it decided he practically

1522
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
On a secret government operation

1523
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:16,927
The reason I think this is important is because once again we find none dare call it conspiracy being the spark that sets off an explosion

1524
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:21,791
Well I'm sure Van Dyke was not the world's most critical thinker prior to October 19th 7

1525
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,839
32 things

1526
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,887
He read that book and it inspired him to

1527
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,447
To create his own anti-government propaganda

1528
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,775
This is exactly the path Alex tells of his own life

1529
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,591
Reading none dare when he was like 12 open

1530
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,383
When does mind the world of secret government

1531
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,175
And set him down the road that he can

1532
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
Continues down to this day

1533
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,551
None dare call it conspiracy is a super dangerous book

1534
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
But not because it reveals

1535
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,367
The truth behind the globalist

1536
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Plotz

1537
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,927
It's dangerous because of a

1538
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
Rhetorical Style

1539
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,743
The way it's written

1540
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Is almost hypnotic

1541
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,327
It relies on oversimplifications

1542
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,143
An excessive use of repeated phrases

1543
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,935
Did almost become a chorus within the

1544
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:04,543
The text to the point where it clearly has the potential to negatively affect people who read it

1545
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,823
If they're a little bit sad

1546
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:09,151
Adjustable or if they're not prepared to deal with what they're reading yet

1547
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
Yeah

1548
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,991
Well obviously not solely responsible for this phenomenon

1549
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,039
I feel like in my experience

1550
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,623
Someone reading none dare and believing it is

1551
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,391
Is an act

1552
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Prepares them

1553
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:24,255
To uncritically receive other anti-government information as fact

1554
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
Grimes

1555
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,839
Alex believes all kinds of

1556
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,143
Completely fabricated things are true

1557
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,935
Because they conform to the narratives

1558
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
Internalize

1559
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,799
Van Dyke believe the Iron Mountain document is true because it can

1560
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,591
Conform to the worldview he'd been

1561
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
Initiated into

1562
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:43,199
Even Richard Belzer is an example of this in our experience

1563
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,271
I am starting to feel like none dare call it a conspiracy is

1564
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,319
Is almost like The Velvet Underground in

1565
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,903
Not a ton of people have read it but everybody who read it wrote their own crazy

1566
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
Conspiracy theory

1567
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:58,559
So far Alex has written a book that was written a book Van Dyke's written about

1568
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,839
Yeah it's it's

1569
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,863
Yeah it is

1570
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,447
It's one of those things that like I never expected when

1571
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
We set out

1572
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:11,871
To do this show that it would pop up in such weird places to look into the silo

1573
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,407
Weapons for quiet Wars

1574
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:17,247
I like all this guy did the stories wild I just did

1575
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
This is just something

1576
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,623
Some guy who had some stupid ideas wrote this it's not a government

1577
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,743
And I never expected like he's interview be like

1578
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
I read none dare call it

1579
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,047
Beersy

1580
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,351
The more I think about it in the more I

1581
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Experience

1582
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655
Even the reading of that text

1583
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
It's

1584
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
Sensitive

1585
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,007
The the the way they're like

1586
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:39,775
Catchphrases

1587
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,055
And like

1588
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,615
Appeals to very oversimplify vlogs

1589
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,639
Yeah that just

1590
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,943
Drive home points in your head

1591
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,735
To the point where if you're read

1592
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
It it does

1593
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
Get to be like

1594
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
Chorus

1595
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
The chorus of the

1596
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,391
The catchphrases are the things that

1597
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,439
Gary Allan wants you to

1598
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,999
Internalized right if you're not paying attention

1599
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,303
He wrote a book and almost calling response

1600
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,839
Yes that kind of yes

1601
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,911
Call Anda responsibility

1602
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
Yeah it is outside

1603
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,751
The call isn't attack

1604
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,799
And so is the response

1605
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
As you're reading it

1606
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,919
You started give the revivers

1607
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:24,319
And everybody gets real comfortable with that

1608
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,439
I mean a lot of persuasive writing

1609
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Is

1610
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
Sort of in that

1611
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Vain

1612
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
A 22 up to a point

1613
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,119
But done there is far past

1614
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
It's a pity

1615
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,959
Like I don't want to put it

1616
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,263
Like two extremely butt

1617
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Comfortable saying it's almost

1618
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
Most called brainwashing

1619
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,407
It-it's

1620
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,247
Think about it the more it pops up the more I realize

1621
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,295
I think we've just got to do

1622
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:59,135
How long it ends up being

1623
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,671
Everything's at Alice back from doing today

1624
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:04,255
Might be 6 hours long I think we just got to do it cuz I think

1625
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,047
It's probably important to address some of the

1626
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,351
But we make it to that event

1627
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,655
Anyway the point is that this guy that first

1628
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,703
This guy is inspired heavily

1629
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,983
Buy none dare call it

1630
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
A e

1631
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:21,407
The second point I want to make is about why Hartford Van Dyke was writing letters to paranoia about his authorship of silent

1632
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,199
But he's paranoid

1633
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:27,039
Because at that point in 2003 the only way

1634
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,319
Communicate with anyone

1635
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,367
Was my letters because he was in prison

1636
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,183
I thought it was going to be in the forest

1637
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,023
Going the wrong direction

1638
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,351
Van Dyke was at that time serving an eight-year sentence for fraud

1639
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:44,703
He in a co-conspirator and tried to pass off over three million dollars in fake currency

1640
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,311
Van Dyke also didn't pay his taxes for years and when he tried to deal with it by sending

1641
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,383
The IRS $600,000 of his fake currency

1642
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,455
Things kind of Escalade

1643
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,783
Battle color the defense team

1644
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,599
According to an article in the Associated Press VanDyke

1645
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,135
Quote claim to his place

1646
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:07,743
33 million dollars and liens against the judges property

1647
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Which is

1648
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,863
Unfortunately a common Sovereign citizen went over

1649
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:19,263
Never not going to like the balls on these people fraudulent liens on

1650
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:25,407
So Hartford Van Dyke has a person with a well-documented history of very dumb beliefs as well as

1651
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,431
Fraudulent Behavior

1652
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,503
He's exactly the sort of person who's Mo matches up

1653
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,063
But someone who would write a document like silent weapons

1654
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
Quiet

1655
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
And because he wrote so what he wrote

1656
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
Mostly matches up

1657
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,463
With what people like Alex and Bill Cooper

1658
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Feel

1659
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,279
Is how the evil globalist work

1660
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,815
They've accepted it as gospel

1661
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
Is an actual government

1662
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,143
This case study

1663
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:50,751
Example is really it's a damning indictment of these people's ability to deal with sources

1664
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:54,079
Instead of accepting that they've been fooled by a hoax

1665
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,895
What they do is what so many people on their side of things

1666
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,223
They insist that every piece of information

1667
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,551
That they're wrong is actually part of the

1668
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,831
Conspiracy itself

1669
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,135
I remember whenever I

1670
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,183
Still was

1671
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,463
Was young and

1672
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,535
Idealistic and I would get into these long emails

1673
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
My dad about

1674
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,375
Play some of his conservative beliefs

1675
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,447
And I remember this one Exchange in

1676
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
Ticular was

1677
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,543
Me just sending him to all of these articles and

1678
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,823
Looking at

1679
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,359
How many words were hyper

1680
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
And then he would send me the response to it

1681
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,735
And there were no words hyperlink in there were no source

1682
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,295
You realize the

1683
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,343
He's like I don't believe your sources

1684
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,879
Well the f****** fine

1685
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,719
Exactly what's then we're done

1686
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:49,119
You know the other thing that you hear a lot is like yeah okay sure Hartford Van Dyke wrote that but everything in it is true

1687
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:54,495
Exactly he was channeling the truth on that larger point

1688
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,519
Isn't true

1689
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,799
What is the government

1690
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,847
Document saved by this secret program

1691
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:05,247
And you guys all safe it is a reason it has credibility to you is for something that

1692
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
It's not true

1693
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
So if you guys

1694
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,111
Bright you got you can receive

1695
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,903
If you ledwith

1696
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,695
A weirdo Rosa

1697
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,119
Right and that's why you don't do that

1698
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:27,007
And also there's a lot of Nazis and fascists lurking around in the background of all this stuff that is weird

1699
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:31,103
Yeah they don't know why I don't know why there's all these Christian identity

1700
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,639
People poking their head up

1701
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,199
Publishing this newsletter I don't know why

1702
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:41,599
This guy is inspired by Gary Island who works for the George Wallace yeah I don't know why

1703
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,623
Seems like

1704
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,415
All of these conspiracy theory

1705
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
Trails

1706
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,487
The people who are Nazis

1707
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
Segregationist

1708
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Or both

1709
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,607
If you do something that I've been

1710
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,655
Wrestling with is

1711
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:00,031
Especially with all this conspiracy theory stuff is not that these guys don't want a One World Government

1712
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
It is that

1713
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,895
They would rather a One World Government run by one guy

1714
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
Then bye

1715
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
20 guys

1716
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,599
Like it's a it's a rhombus individualistic like I want a supreme leader who can cut through all this b******* thing

1717
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:16,159
I'm sick of all these globalist discussing thing

1718
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:21,279
Really don't like discussing I will agree with you on that seem like every

1719
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:27,679
Every one of these conspiracy theory movements really focuses on the the number of people that gets everywhere the building

1720
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:29,983
Think

1721
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,311
Some of it comes down to be oversimplifying a

1722
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,591
So please don't take this as like

1723
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,871
Me saying this

1724
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,663
This explains everything

1725
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:42,015
Think there is a strain of it that is like well you know how the European Union work

1726
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,111
You know there's all these countries and there's free travel between

1727
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:52,511
You can just go wherever you want to go with your EU passport so there's a one-world government everybody

1728
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:56,863
Can go everywhere and that would be like

1729
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:03,519
Really bad for these people who don't like minorities people being around

1730
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,335
I know that that's not everything that's not the whole

1731
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,919
Story but it would be ludicrous for us not to accept that is some part of it

1732
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
Bill Cooper

1733
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:15,039
Because I'm from a lot of the stuff that I've listened to him

1734
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
He seems

1735
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
Pretty

1736
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,647
Emphatically non-racist

1737
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,671
I don't know if he has

1738
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:24,511
I don't know if it's fair to say that he doesn't cold races

1739
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Believes

1740
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,071
But he is pretty vocally

1741
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
Against races

1742
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
Yeah

1743
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,143
So I don't know

1744
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:34,495
He doesn't strike me as somebody who's one of those white nationalist e-types

1745
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,799
But I do think that there is a large

1746
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:40,383
Contingent within the people who are afraid of

1747
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
That is in place

1748
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,967
It's not so much that there's nowhere

1749
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
Can go to escape the world cover

1750
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,039
Everyone else

1751
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,063
Can come to me

1752
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,855
That's fast don't think I ever took a

1753
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,391
Get that far as to what

1754
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,207
Their fears of a one world government would be but

1755
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:58,047
Why do species X but immigration demographic

1756
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:04,447
Pick a number isn't s*** I just don't get how they don't also include geography as a

1757
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
AB

1758
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
To this whole

1759
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:10,847
All we get rid of border so that means everybody's going to come here because it's the best ones like

1760
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,407
Anyway

1761
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
Bill

1762
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
But it is spoken

1763
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,015
About to

1764
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,807
This time weather

1765
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,831
Quiet Wars

1766
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
And so have I

1767
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
It's nonsense

1768
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
And

1769
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
His first episode

1770
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,487
The first chapter of behold a Pale Horse

1771
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,279
Largely a thesis statement

1772
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,327
It's meant to prove that this

1773
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,119
Conspiracy exists right

1774
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Is bulge

1775
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
Right

1776
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,191
So congratulations

1777
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,727
So we're off to a good start

1778
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
Coming out the gate hot

1779
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
Yes but

1780
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:43,871
You don't believe in a lot of the stuff that build as you probably a sheeple

1781
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
Probably she

1782
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,455
Quiz

1783
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,015
For you to figure out if your

1784
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
Yes please

1785
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:56,415
Wells Fargo

1786
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,463
I'm not one of those

1787
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
People

1788
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,791
Well let's find out

1789
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,839
Shoot the messenger

1790
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,399
Because you can never solve a problem

1791
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Recognize

1792
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
Is it for what it is

1793
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,263
Okay

1794
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
It

1795
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,152
I'm just asking a few questions

1796
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
To find out

1797
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,200
If you are really

1798
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
People

1799
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Or not

1800
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,296
Questionnaire

1801
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,344
Do you believe in before

1802
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Purpose

1803
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
And

1804
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
The articles

1805
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
Selfie

1806
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,720
Second article amendments

1807
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,488
The Constitution

1808
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,256
Love the United States

1809
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
America

1810
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
The Rite of peace

1811
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
Bear arm

1812
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,936
If you do will you agree to go

1813
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:42,240
Always any effort

1814
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,544
2/4 American

1815
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,824
Register their gun

1816
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
Wouldn't you

1817
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,408
No

1818
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
Never

1819
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
Will I ready

1820
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:53,760
Play weapons

1821
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,832
So that seems to be the only question in this quiz

1822
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:02,976
Is is are you going to catch them

1823
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:06,560
Seems like it's just that if you believe in the 2nd Amendment you're not a sheep

1824
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Bridal

1825
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,168
So I mean he is a pretty big gun absolutist in the same way that Alex's

1826
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,448
That's all you have another

1827
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,240
I think they're

1828
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,264
He discusses

1829
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,336
Some of these gone beliefs are also very reminiscent

1830
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,872
Of ways that Alex

1831
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,920
Experiences gun

1832
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,200
Issues

1833
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,224
That are

1834
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
Seem out of lockstep

1835
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,296
With what you

1836
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,624
See as the right yeah he is the GOP

1837
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,696
Let me ask you if you believe there

1838
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
If you would never

1839
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,024
40 movie

1840
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,048
Register

1841
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
Our weapon

1842
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
Bmra

1843
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
If you do

1844
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Why

1845
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:52,896
Because let me tell you something right now though if you belong in our a you have already

1846
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
Register your gun

1847
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,808
Goku looks like Alex Jones

1848
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,856
Is anti-nra

1849
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:08,256
Especially and Alex has gotten more into the NRA in like a very recent days but Intel

1850
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:13,120
Fairly recently in his early career he was very anti-nra

1851
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:19,008
He was very into people like Aaron zellman's Organization for the preservation of firearms ownership

1852
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,848
And Larry Pratt's gun owners for America America

1853
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,688
He was very much against the NRA he felt like they were a gun can

1854
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,968
Control organization

1855
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,504
As opposed to being

1856
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,344
And that is not something that's very consistent in the the right wing

1857
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,624
Except for

1858
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,416
This

1859
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:42,816
So is Bill Cooper's main point here that if you are a member of the NRA you are revealing to the government that you have

1860
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,584
Have guns

1861
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
Thus you are Bass

1862
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
Sickly registering your

1863
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,680
That's one big part of it

1864
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:52,032
Absolutely that is where the these lists will be already

1865
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:59,456
And the other part of it is an argument that he has about the NRA misleading

1866
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,992
What gun owners

1867
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,528
Ship is for would you get them to in this

1868
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,624
Minneapolis notices discarded

1869
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:17,888
Registered Young by Journey

1870
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,472
Like what

1871
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,568
Indian poker

1872
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
Hurt

1873
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,408
You weren't going to be easy to

1874
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,688
To get rid of the gun

1875
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
Cloak

1876
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,528
Emergency

1877
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
Protecting animals

1878
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
Journal Review

1879
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,720
Connected with the animal

1880
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,072
Somebody out there

1881
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,912
Besides the very few of us were dreaming thinking

1882
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,472
Begin to think along with us

1883
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:59,104
So that is very similar to 22 Alex's conception

1884
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,200
Yeah mischaracterizing gun ownership as a being about hunting

1885
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,528
Can lead to a way to take away cup

1886
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:12,928
Yeah our enemy is playing four dimensional chess where in their supporting us with their controlled operation opposition in the

1887
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:18,560
NRA who gets everybody to register their guns and tie at The Hunting haha

1888
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
Is there

1889
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,864
Under their control also

1890
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:25,984
Is there anything you can't hunt anymore instead of removing the needs for guns guns the attack

1891
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:31,104
Egg hunting at night yeah because we're how you kill these animals it's so cruel man

1892
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:36,992
Play in football and also largely explains why there is such a position

1893
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,576
Things like licenses for hunting and

1894
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,112
And game restrictions

1895
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,648
And see right

1896
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:48,000
Poaching rules

1897
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,024
Attack on guns

1898
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
By virtue of

1899
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,632
The characterization is guns being

1900
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,424
Right it's all very weird

1901
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,192
Itsfunneh

1902
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,728
Sovereign citizen

1903
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:04,128
Extinct by imagining an enemy that is so incredibly devious and intelligent they themselves are.

1904
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
Intelligent

1905
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:09,248
Well the same time not realizing that their enemies devious intelligence manifest

1906
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,808
Double really stupid plans that don't make any sense

1907
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,136
And I don't think that outside of some like

1908
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:15,904
Pretty

1909
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,440
Far-out circles

1910
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,744
People have a problem with hunting

1911
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
Within

1912
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:26,912
Recently we don't want to kill a population around

1913
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:30,240
But there is a there is a part of nature that you can

1914
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:34,080
Be apart of people are at least capable of saying

1915
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Okay

1916
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,408
If we hunt all the deer away

1917
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,456
I won't be able to hunt

1918
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:46,368
And there'll be ramifications for the larger ecosystem and then I won't be able to hunt that and I won't be able to do that right they can

1919
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,928
They can understand that naked self-interest stop

1920
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:52,256
And how regulation is I think a lot of people

1921
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,048
I think generally people are in the

1922
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,352
I'm at but I'm not sure that I know of

1923
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
Too many

1924
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:05,568
Prominent voices that are like no one should hunt anything yet I might be wrong but I don't think I hear that argument

1925
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:09,152
Too much did the bigger point is the bill has this

1926
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,432
Gun position

1927
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:13,760
Very similar to Alex's early gun position

1928
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
There's just

1929
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
It's every

1930
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,648
Yeah almost everything is like this it this is

1931
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,672
This is

1932
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
This is

1933
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,720
And obviously Alex

1934
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,536
It's good here

1935
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:28,096
He had Bill Cooper on his show

1936
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,656
So yeah yeah yeah

1937
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,728
We we find out

1938
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,032
The bill has a little bit of an organization

1939
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
But he runs

1940
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:37,824
And

1941
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,872
Explain why

1942
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,664
He has a bad information

1943
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
Go to be like

1944
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,736
Information tracker

1945
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,272
What we're all about what we have to

1946
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:49,088
Offer some of the available material that we have

1947
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,392
Information about

1948
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,208
Joint intelligence

1949
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:58,048
What year was already thinking that I started years ago

1950
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
This moment

1951
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,656
Pavilion in Commerce

1952
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,704
During organization in the world

1953
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,984
Golfer the most

1954
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,312
A lot of the information

1955
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
You're going to hear

1956
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
Program

1957
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,408
Country

1958
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,504
Unsung heroes

1959
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,784
I prefer to remain in the back

1960
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,344
Constantly Gathering

1961
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
Putting information

1962
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,416
Central

1963
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,464
Clearinghouse

1964
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,024
Where we are the process

1965
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,584
Alison Brie

1966
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
Tupac

1967
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,912
What is the deception

1968
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,240
What they want us to believe any other issues

1969
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:43,360
So bill has the citizens agencies joint intelligence

1970
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,640
Which is just his

1971
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:48,480
Stocking listeners and Weirdos

1972
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
Not good

1973
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:56,160
That's not a good Clearinghouse that's not a good system I would first give people a taste for about 1

1974
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,720
Sent and then go from there but

1975
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
Sia

1976
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,840
This is only a good system if you had

1977
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,888
Intensely rigorous

1978
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
Standards

1979
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,680
In place for

1980
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,960
Scrutinizing that

1981
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,752
Yeah you need to have

1982
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:13,312
A default position of everything that comes in his

1983
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,080
Bulshit

1984
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
Or else

1985
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,384
What you're doing is he saying like

1986
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,736
Hey sometimes stranger send me things and I believe he literally said his

1987
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
His

1988
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,344
The whole thing is I have a default position of everything is b*******

1989
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624
So

1990
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,440
But based on that I don't believe that exact

1991
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
Don't believe it

1992
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,536
He believes silent weapon

1993
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
Quiet Wars

1994
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:38,656
So I don't believe that you could handle a Clearinghouse event

1995
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,704
Information that has tons of people sending

1996
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Nope

1997
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,496
So you got to sleep

1998
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,032
That's the that's the

1999
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,056
Or happy

2000
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,336
People send the truth to you by

2001
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:49,408
That's seeking it

2002
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
Fries

2003
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,760
Nothing else

2004
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,040
Whirlpool Duet

2005
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
Nothing

2006
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:05,024
Chandler police

2007
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,816
President of the United

2008
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,144
Not Rush Limbaugh

2009
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,824
Four were all manipulated

2010
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,104
We're all

2011
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
Red

2012
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
I'll say

2013
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
Wow

2014
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,456
Now I'm starting to think this guy

2015
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
There is something

2016
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,040
We're all mislead

2017
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,088
Is a really fun thing

2018
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:34,976
To say about your best friend at the end of this episode about

2019
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,536
Document that he was misled about

2020
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,304
Yeah like

2021
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,144
One thing to say we're all misled and none of us are perfect and

2022
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,936
And that that's what that's all good

2023
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,728
Well it's another thing

2024
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
To save that sort of

2025
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:52,640
Like glibly as we like as a toss off on an episode that you or misled about

2026
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,456
ADI would you

2027
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
If you're Bill Cooper

2028
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
View

2029
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:02,880
Make silent weapons for quiet Wars the first chapter of the old Pale Horse

2030
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,416
Use it as the source

2031
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,208
Material for the first episode of

2032
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:10,560
The hour of the time and then a month later let's save like guys I was

2033
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:14,912
Miss lied about that you would never do that

2034
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,216
Too many it's a keystone

2035
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,240
Yelp

2036
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
The building

2037
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,544
Of anti-government

2038
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
Paranoia

2039
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,360
You can't afford

2040
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,640
The question

2041
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,944
Right so no I don't believe I don't believe

2042
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,736
The premise at all that you got a secret

2043
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
The truth I don't believe it

2044
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:35,136
Yeah that is it is always interesting whenever so much of what he says is

2045
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,160
Is based on

2046
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:39,488
Stuff that I got you know we're all aware that something is

2047
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:46,144
And I get where he's coming from and I get what he's trying to do but unfortunately his entire theory is built on

2048
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:50,752
Something that's factually inaccurate and so no matter what from there on out it's

2049
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
Color you know

2050
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,848
It's like if Paul was a Satanist

2051
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,664
You are the rock of my church The Devil you know like

2052
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,480
Yeah it's ya uou have

2053
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Your

2054
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,832
Presumably honest work

2055
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
Digging

2056
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,672
It's based on a hoax that was inspired now

2057
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,952
Yeah so

2058
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,720
What are you do

2059
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,000
Yeah. Nothing

2060
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
You pointed your

2061
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,072
Quote unquote rigorous mind

2062
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,936
Beginning from a place of reality truth maybe we wouldn't get there

2063
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:23,520
Maybe he'd be a weirdo militia that believe reality I don't know

2064
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,824
Monroe

2065
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,104
So building

2066
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,408
Next clip expresses vet

2067
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,200
Interesting

2068
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,992
Approach towards broadcast

2069
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,552
That I think Alex probably also believe

2070
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:42,720
If you weren't here what you cannot and will not here anywhere else I don't care who are the other what they prefer

2071
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,280
Politics are how loyal they are the Constitution

2072
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,072
You will not hear anywhere else

2073
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,008
Maybe angry

2074
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,056
Then I have a concrete

2075
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
One of my goals

2076
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:03,968
People to ask unless they have strong feelings about what

2077
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:11,136
I think that Alex has a very similar approach that you're not going to hear any of the stuff that I talk about anywhere else

2078
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,416
Yeah certainly

2079
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,440
That's in line

2080
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,280
Then the other I want to inspire strong emotion

2081
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,048
Continue

2082
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:23,168
Yeah let's talk about that all the time about how he's you know I ain't got a gravelly voice of abrasive

2083
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
Trying to wake you up

2084
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,240
I am trying to be vocal

2085
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
Emotion in you

2086
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
Guy disrespect

2087
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,616
Tatooine

2088
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,200
I don't know I don't know if it's always wrong

2089
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,736
But when it's based on lies

2090
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,016
I think it's very wrong

2091
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,808
I need you're trying to short-circuit

2092
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:42,368
That you're trying to take a shortcut in people's brains

2093
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,720
To get them to override their critical thinking skills wow all your doing

2094
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,512
Talking about how important critical thinking

2095
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,560
Bear bear

2096
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,608
They're cheating

2097
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
The game

2098
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:58,240
But there is there is it is true that you cannot inspire people to mass action without

2099
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:02,592
An emotional element that you know that the women's March

2100
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:07,456
Doesn't have as many people as it does if there isn't a strong emotional connection

2101
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,480
2 what's going on

2102
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,016
Real

2103
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:13,600
That strong emotional connection isn't their overriding the

2104
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:18,976
There is a

2105
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,560
Yeah and I just think that

2106
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,608
I think that these strategy

2107
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
Leading with

2108
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,960
That being

2109
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:30,240
An emotional response

2110
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,008
Is

2111
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,312
It should go the other direction

2112
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,592
Not good

2113
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,640
Probably a dishonest

2114
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,176
Strategy at its core

2115
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,224
Yeah if you want if you want

2116
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,320
Good things to happen it has to begin with cradle critical thinking

2117
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,112
That leads to an emotional response

2118
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,392
Ideal

2119
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,928
You know by looking at

2120
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,488
Certain policies that are like

2121
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,816
You know there's no immigration

2122
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:58,144
At the very beginning you know Iran is none of these people can come in

2123
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
Right

2124
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,984
There's no critical thinking there it's just

2125
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:04,032
Emotion I don't

2126
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,592
Feel like these people are good so they have to go out

2127
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,872
Where is people's

2128
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,640
And that is

2129
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,432
Know what you're really doing

2130
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,736
Is trying to exclude an in

2131
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
Higher religion from this country

2132
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,088
And that gives me a strong emotional react

2133
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,392
Not the emotional reaction being

2134
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,928
Bob

2135
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,696
You know

2136
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,000
But if you listen to our of the time

2137
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,072
And you have a strong emotional reaction it's positive

2138
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,608
That's great because you're just going to

2139
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,400
To dig deeper in and find the truth

2140
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Negative

2141
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,472
Angry angry

2142
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
That's good too

2143
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,080
Heard anything

2144
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:44,480
Try to prove that what you hear on hearing wrong

2145
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,088
Most of it will always be right on the money

2146
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
And where it is

2147
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,184
It will turn you around

2148
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,744
You will begin to realize

2149
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,328
That you are bi

2150
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
Getting

2151
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,400
To think for yourself

2152
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,704
Samantha revelation

2153
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:11,616
I'm right 99% of guys I heard exactly that I heard it

2154
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,408
You know even then later on it turns out I'm right

2155
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,016
And also Bill excludes one possibility and it might be a very rare

2156
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,320
Response to a show which is Delight

2157
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,880
And the desire

2158
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:28,000
To learn more about the things he's talking about with a skeptical eye

2159
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:31,072
Angry nor delighted

2160
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,608
Rejoice like I'm not

2161
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,144
It's very rare response

2162
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,168
It's the one I have it

2163
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,448
Probably not good

2164
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
His bottom line

2165
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:43,104
Although I'm not sure he's concerned about that in 2019

2166
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,640
I don't know

2167
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,664
Probably

2168
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,200
It probably is bankrupt

2169
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,480
What are you die

2170
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,272
Call the monkey

2171
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,368
Even if it would even if it wasn't bankrupt

2172
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,440
The moment the government was like oh s*** you always

2173
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,208
What's a lot of money

2174
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:58,976
It would then be

2175
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,768
Yeah he's winding down

2176
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,840
Down here and then giving this Dismount that is like the

2177
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:08,704
You know we're going to stir up strong emotions and if you hate me you're going to dig into this and most of the

2178
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,104
But I'm going to find them right sometimes I'm wrong maybe about gigantic thing

2179
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:21,504
We're all human he likes to imagine that the things he's wrong about is a date or

2180
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
Document is fake

2181
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:27,392
That's the thing you're wrong about at

2182
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:33,024
Right right not superficial details you're wrong.

2183
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,816
It's not like I'm sorry

2184
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:40,192
It was Lee Harvey Oswald by himself I apologize I thought it was the Russians or whatever yes

2185
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,752
Who's to say that like the government's on the up-and-up and you

2186
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:45,312
You stuck everything they do is good

2187
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,616
This conspiracy

2188
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
That undergirds

2189
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,200
So much of the

2190
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:55,040
The militia paranoia that one world government

2191
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,064
Is

2192
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,344
Based on a hoax

2193
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
Bogus

2194
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,904
It is not really

2195
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,928
Strong

2196
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:01,696
Evidence

2197
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,976
Any of this

2198
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:07,328
So I asked the Dismount goes on Bill announces that everyone

2199
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,120
Wednesday is going to be a special show

2200
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,424
On his broadcast

2201
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,216
Every Wednesday night we're going to devote

2202
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,544
Threat

2203
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,080
Criminal organization

2204
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,128
Internal Revenue

2205
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,456
Denver Federal Reserve

2206
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,832
Turn Revenue Service

2207
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,112
Russian Asia

2208
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,208
Don't worry about it all

2209
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:40,608
That's something that's not true but it's all good Alex Jones believes he talks about it all the time the IRS is just the collection are

2210
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:45,472
I can see the seeds of his own destruction sown in this

2211
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,568
So

2212
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,336
Constant

2213
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
Constant

2214
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,128
Like

2215
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,432
Like beliefs that are like

2216
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,456
It's not

2217
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
Real

2218
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,552
That Alex has we can just Trace back almost directly

2219
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,088
Two things of Bill Cooper

2220
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:04,928
The last clip and I think it also is another thing

2221
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
That

2222
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
Alex

2223
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,048
In his repertoire

2224
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,864
The bill probably has a little bit more

2225
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,192
But also I believe that's because Bill was a little bit less

2226
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
Of a coward

2227
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,032
And he was not trying to make it big

2228
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:21,824
Conspiracy

2229
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Yes

2230
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,152
Are we being manipulated and 10

2231
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:28,992
Old and guided into a new world order the new world religion

2232
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
Yes

2233
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,088
Is there a group

2234
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,928
Charger charge all along who bring this about

2235
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Yes

2236
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,280
Where is old

2237
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,608
Are the followers

2238
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
Prevision

2239
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
Oh no

2240
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:50,752
Elizabeth

2241
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,520
Evergreen

2242
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,056
No

2243
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Future

2244
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,848
Leaffilter

2245
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Our

2246
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,504
So Bill know

2247
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,272
Oh okay

2248
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:09,952
Esoteric mystery religion and always and always

2249
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,768
And far be if

2250
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,304
For me to say that he's not

2251
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,864
Somebody who also uses Eddy's medic tropes

2252
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,680
To characterize is villain

2253
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:24,288
Listen to enough of him to have a larger sense and nothing has

2254
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,360
Stuck out to me as overt as a lot of Alex's

2255
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:30,176
Stop but the episodes that I have heard where he talks about this

2256
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:32,480
It's straight up like Babylonian mist

2257
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,760
Nicole Coates

2258
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,040
So it it's

2259
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
But it's

2260
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,344
The point I'm trying to make with

2261
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,112
This is that like

2262
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,648
Alex

2263
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:41,696
Clearly believes that as well

2264
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:48,096
And in present-day you talked about how everyone's demon-possessed and it's all this the devil is of operating so

2265
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,888
System that lived on forever and

2266
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,448
And all of history is had all these

2267
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,472
Eat Valdez

2268
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,544
It's very similar in a lot of ways

2269
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,104
But Alex when he was starting up

2270
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:02,688
And even into fairly recent times it's all been like

2271
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:05,248
Now that's all mumbo-jumbo bulshit

2272
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,016
Because he wanted

2273
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
To differentiate himself

2274
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,856
Bill does talk about UFOs

2275
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:14,208
Bill does talk about this esoteric mystery religion

2276
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,232
Wingstop

2277
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,512
The core of all that

2278
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:21,632
And Alex clearly believed that to admit it cuz he didn't want to

2279
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:24,704
Be treated like yeah you didn't want to be put in the box

2280
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,288
That was like oh yeah you already UFO guy all you believe in

2281
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:30,592
Lizard people you believe in

2282
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:32,384
Mystery Cults from

2283
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
2000

2284
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,968
BC that are still running the world

2285
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,064
Treated like that because on some level he knew that that was silly

2286
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,136
He wanted to block now I'm just a meat-and-potatoes guy

2287
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:46,976
I'm just a guy who's out here talkin about hard concrete facts

2288
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,512
Documents

2289
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,584
That's that's the presentation that he wanted

2290
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,400
But as time has gone on that mask has slipped

2291
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,960
A ton even see that even this

2292
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:57,984
This sort of

2293
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,032
Mystery ancient culture

2294
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,104
Is something that he believes too and he probably always have

2295
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:10,016
Yeah it does Bill was not afraid to wear it on his sleeve it does seem like if I was listening to the show with

2296
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
With an i

2297
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,880
At his at his age with an eye towards getting into this kind of thing

2298
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:17,184
It's a real short

2299
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,208
Leave to go

2300
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,256
Okay I'll do his show

2301
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:24,864
Rain in some of the weirdness I'll add some more bombast to counteract

2302
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,656
That I'm talking about Les

2303
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:29,984
Crazy ideas I'm going to add more crazy antics

2304
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,264
To balance that out

2305
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,104
And then I got shot the crazy Antics were even that much of his earlier

2306
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
I guess some of that

2307
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:42,528
The public access.

2308
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,296
Supposed to

2309
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
Everybody

2310
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,880
Yeah and it's not it

2311
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:47,648
It's a gold

2312
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,208
It's not something that I would ever think

2313
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,488
Is a

2314
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,536
Like an intentional choice

2315
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
But

2316
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,120
You could easily see a way for you to fit in

2317
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
Into the market

2318
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,168
Yeah

2319
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:04,032
By taking a lot of the stuff that bill does taking a lot of the elements

2320
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:10,432
This and repackaging it a little bit maybe you had to give his dad a detailed business plan of how he's going to do Bilco per show

2321
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
Show before you got that initial

2322
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,296
I love this show

2323
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,344
Yes I know I know

2324
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,112
Find it to be

2325
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:18,880
Be fascinated

2326
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,416
Cuz Bill Cooper is

2327
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,440
Crying

2328
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,000
It's refreshing to see a person who has a point

2329
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,024
He attempts to make

2330
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,840
And even if the point he's making is dumb and the oven

2331
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,120
Currency has forward is a hoax

2332
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,656
He's still trying

2333
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:33,472
Regardless of the reality unreality of the

2334
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,496
He's trying

2335
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,032
And there's a measure of

2336
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,848
That's what he's doing even if the competence isn't in the

2337
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:41,152
The research are the sourcing or anything

2338
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,688
The presentation is compass

2339
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,992
I think I'm struck by

2340
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:47,296
Is how much of a statement bill is making

2341
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,088
In this inaugural episode and how come

2342
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,112
Complete the messages

2343
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,952
Most of the episode of how they're about how there's a secret War

2344
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,976
The public which bill is

2345
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:55,744
Committed to fighting

2346
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,536
That's a point.

2347
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,816
I require some support

2348
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:01,120
So Bill provides the underlying evidence

2349
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:03,168
For his claim namely the silent weapons

2350
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,192
Quiet Wars.

2351
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,728
It's not real

2352
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,008
But if it were

2353
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,056
Then he would have made an

2354
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,592
And supported it with evidence

2355
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,896
Which is exactly what a show like this is supposed to

2356
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,712
He's doing his job anyway the Alex

2357
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,736
Refuses to

2358
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,760
Or is unable to

2359
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
Absolutely

2360
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,296
But here's

2361
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,832
That there's more to the state

2362
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,856
Then just that

2363
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:26,720
There's another statement being made and that serve by the musical q that he chose for the intro

2364
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,536
Bill Cooper play The Beach Boys make it big for a reason

2365
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,560
That wasn't

2366
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,840
Just some arbitrary station

2367
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,888
That wasn't the single

2368
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,448
It wasn't played on the radio and the album

2369
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:38,240
It came from came out

2370
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:41,568
34 years prior to when this episode was recorded

2371
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,128
Build shows that song to be played in the introduction

2372
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,664
First episode

2373
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,200
Cuz it speaks to his philosophy

2374
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:48,992
Humble lyrics

2375
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:52,576
Quote have a little faith in yourself in everything that you do

2376
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:55,136
You know you're going to make it big if you want to

2377
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,672
If you really want to

2378
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,952
You can make it big

2379
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:02,816
In the song whose lyrics are about becoming the big movie star and singer name in the bright lights

2380
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,608
The bill is using the song

2381
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,376
Flip the meaning

2382
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,144
It parody

2383
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:10,240
He's using the song about becoming a star in the entertainment industry to make a point

2384
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:12,032
But he doesn't want to be a star

2385
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
And never will

2386
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,360
The fact that he's out here talkin about silent weapons

2387
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,384
For quiet Wars

2388
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,480
Make it impossible that they will ever allow him to make it big

2389
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,272
The very idea is a farce

2390
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,064
But he has a little faith in

2391
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,856
Himself and everything he does

2392
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:28,160
So Bill Cooper is going to make it big

2393
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
But he's going to make it big on his own

2394
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,488
It's really remarkable

2395
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,816
Between his actual words and stylistic choices

2396
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,376
In this episode Bill shows you who he is

2397
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,144
Yeah

2398
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,168
It's it's

2399
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,192
Good radio

2400
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
It is

2401
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:48,896
Kind of infuriating yeah it's kind of infuriating on a on a certain level just is like The Grass Is Always Greener

2402
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,944
Kind of like

2403
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:57,600
We spent three years talk about that a****** whenever this a****** is available what I do and I don't know if we'd have

2404
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:02,464
Wrestle with a lot of this stuff if it wasn't for

2405
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,304
No that's what I say The Grass Is Always Greener

2406
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,400
It's not to say that this show is going to become all the hour of the time all the time

2407
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,936
But

2408
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:14,752
I want to pursue this an atom

2409
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:17,568
I have been listening to a ton of him and I'm going to keep blessing

2410
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
Something to it because it

2411
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Really intrigues me

2412
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,664
And I think

2413
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,688
B u c

2414
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:27,040
Because we spend as much time with Alex

2415
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:27,808
We have such a

2416
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:31,392
Familiarity with a lot of his rhetoric and a lot of the choices that he makes

2417
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:35,488
Going back and listening to this stuff you just see the bloop

2418
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,768
You see the

2419
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,072
The things that Alex has stolen

2420
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,864
Things that

2421
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,424
Alex would never own up to being like

2422
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,728
This is where I got this idea from

2423
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
And I think

2424
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:50,080
The more I listen to bail the more I'll be able to

2425
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,872
Oh that's what Alex says

2426
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,408
But he never provide the source

2427
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,944
Rental provide source

2428
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,272
They'll be able to track down a lot of cross reference

2429
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:00,832
I think we'll be able to do that and I think that

2430
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,112
That will be

2431
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:04,672
More fun Wacky Wednesday

2432
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,976
And because as we mentioned at the end of this

2433
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,512
Bill does talk about alien

2434
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:14,912
And Bill does talk about a bunch of stuff that fits into the wacky Cannon I'm in for it so this will be able

2435
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,448
Leave the most fertile ground

2436
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:19,008
And it won't be a situation where we'll have to

2437
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,032
Cruel

2438
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,848
To the collars coasttocoastam

2439
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,640
We can just enjoy

2440
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,968
The man-made Alex possible

2441
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:32,320
And I learned a bit more I think I think it serves all our fur

2442
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,624
You know we were talking about this

2443
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,160
Just slightly

2444
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,232
Recently I've just like

2445
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,584
Now agree with you when you said

2446
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,656
I don't agree with Bill Cooper but I do feel like I could

2447
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,680
Could sit down and talk

2448
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:54,592
Yeah I couldn't talk. I couldn't sit down at a bar with Alex and I talked at all not a person

2449
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:57,664
Rights and all that he doesn't live

2450
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,456
Where doesn't appear to live

2451
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,736
As a fool

2452
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,296
More than a character sketch

2453
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:08,160
Carries himself in like you see it in interviews on his own show

2454
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,208
Videos that he shoots out on the street

2455
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,256
Eventually all of those

2456
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:15,072
Situations are performance spaces

2457
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:17,888
You can make the argument that a once the cameras off

2458
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:24,288
He is a completely different person he's thoughtful consideration are all that you could make that argument

2459
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,592
But you can you can say that

2460
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:32,736
I see Bill is much more of a full human like someone you can have a beer

2461
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,272
It is

2462
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,296
Tumi

2463
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
Bye

2464
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
Just like

2465
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,112
Comedy wise

2466
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
You can tell

2467
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:42,464
Forever I can tell doing it so long is just like

2468
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:45,536
When somebody walks up on stage and they start talking like

2469
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,816
That's all bulshit

2470
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
That's

2471
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:52,704
F****** b******* you can tell when somebody walks up and their beer

2472
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
And you're like

2473
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,240
Got it

2474
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,800
Almost instant I felt that with Bill

2475
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:02,176
That that whole like yeah you can have a beer with him is

2476
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,456
So used by like

2477
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:10,112
Trying to rationalize bush

2478
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,136
Like I said

2479
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:14,464
Tons of bills pinions that II would disagree with him

2480
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,792
Aggressively to have that

2481
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:21,632
But I think he could engage in that conversation

2482
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:24,448
It'll be great if we sat down to my cable silent weapon

2483
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,240
Prince's fake

2484
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,520
I don't know how that go

2485
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:31,360
I don't have that beer would go

2486
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:38,016
Feels like there could be a conversation where is Alex or just yell at you exactly talk about how you're a devil and that's because you have a cross

2487
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,880
Alex at that bar is a

2488
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:45,440
Coward who would run away from a

2489
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:50,048
Actual conversation and I think Bill would lean into it and be like okay

2490
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,072
Let's

2491
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:53,120
Figure that let me tell you what's come into

2492
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:56,704
It's all right though

2493
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,472
I built

2494
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:00,800
Let's hear about pageant

2495
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,592
Signed by the president

2496
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,872
That means it must be real

2497
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:10,272
Alright Bill wanted to give myself this gift is

2498
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,064
I need I need things

2499
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,088
Inspire me

2500
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:15,648
And I realize that the things that I'm most

2501
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,184
Twisted in are the things

2502
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,232
They give us a larger understanding

2503
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,792
The propaganda and the

2504
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:22,816
Media specific

2505
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:25,376
Quickly that are at the root of a lot of this page

2506
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,960
Patriot militia anti-communist right-wing

2507
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,728
World

2508
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,264
And with Alex

2509
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,848
It's so muddy now especially in the present day because

2510
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,896
Everything has become so

2511
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,200
Anyone can create their own media

2512
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,736
So there's hundreds

2513
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:41,504
Hundreds of

2514
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,040
Dumb YouTube shows

2515
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:45,856
That are all espousing very similar message

2516
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,160
The back in the 90s

2517
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:48,928
There was

2518
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,720
There were only a few

2519
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,488
You show

2520
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:55,328
Yeah like a lot of them were on this wwcr shortwave

2521
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,608
Broadcast

2522
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,376
But

2523
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:59,424
In terms of ones that are influential

2524
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,752
A lot of people don't remember and never would remember

2525
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,800
A lot of these other shows is known as

2526
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:07,360
But people in that world

2527
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,896
Were listening to Bill Cooper

2528
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,944
This was a bit of a bottleneck

2529
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:15,040
For a lot of these ideas being disseminated

2530
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,088
What I find particularly interesting

2531
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,112
Thing is going back in

2532
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:18,880
And scene

2533
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:21,440
Like we don't know what Alex was doing in 1990

2534
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:23,488
B3 necessarily wasn't creating a

2535
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,256
Product

2536
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,072
He wasn't we don't have a lot of Records or any

2537
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,120
But we can get a sense

2538
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,400
Of him by

2539
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,936
Is what media was he taking

2540
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,728
Yeah and if we get a better under

2541
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:36,544
Understanding a Bill Cooper and the hour of the time

2542
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,872
I think it gives us a much larger picture of what his

2543
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
Created

2544
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,664
This

2545
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:42,944
Gross

2546
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,040
I agree I like adding him to our Rogues gallery

2547
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,064
Immensely

2548
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,440
So we will see where things go in the future but

2549
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,976
Until then Jordan

2550
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:58,048
We have a website

2551
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:08,032
ITunes or other podcast will have to leave download leave a review or donate or whatever
