00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan Jordan

5
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
Question what's up

6
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,008
Interesting storm

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,128
Yesterday Monday as we're recording this

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
You know Chicago's really interesting place

9
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
You were a little bit south of me and you were telling me nothing

10
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,952
The debris all over the place

11
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,560
At all like you just saw a little bit of rain

12
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
I saw

13
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
The rain line

14
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Yeah

15
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,984
So light it was a little ways away from a I could see you

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,288
Terrifying pouring rain

17
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
And I was completely drives banana

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
Meanwhile up at my place

19
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
Locked up

20
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,784
I'm very lucky compared to see some pictures of like

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Treason

22
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,184
My lights were flickering and

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
Definitely been much more than you expected to do

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
Okay I can prop I'm from

25
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,776
Central Missouri

26
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
To do I can find someplace even if I

27
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
In a live on the top floor.

28
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:39,744
Nothing ended up happening and that everything was all right.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
Wandering around my house

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
I know that

31
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
That

32
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
I haven't even mentioned

33
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
I knew I have been

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Tons of plants

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,736
Ridiculously long process

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Completely sucked it up because of

37
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
Just like

38
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
Got a little

39
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,632
Salt at the After the Storm

40
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
Nelson song After the Rain

41
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,152
Promise never to purple rainbow

42
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,992
The form of a tiny little thing of a Bonsai popping out

43
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
I like it I like it

44
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
I got the Bonsai, going to be a mess

45
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,816
Are you going to make fun of me because probably will this is Commerce related

46
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,400
But newly-minted Raptor Princess Emily

47
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Has made us some new designs

48
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
The Earth

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Defense for Aesthetics

50
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,456
Is really really cool human hitting a robot

51
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
It's so cool

52
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,208
Thank you so much

53
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,839
Are closer to the episode where Alex announced

54
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
The shirt is really awesome

55
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
It's never available public

56
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Integrate

57
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
It's so good

58
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,463
Pretty cool so Jordan today to go over there will be interesting

59
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,447
1120

60
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Little bit of the storm gave me some trouble

61
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Workflow

62
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
That's scared

63
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,343
By weather

64
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
I know and you know

65
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
Granteed's

66
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
I wasn't as worried as I had

67
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
Missouri

68
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
Weather sometimes

69
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
The uncertainty of it

70
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,703
For a good party afternoon

71
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
With just completely dark skies

72
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
When you're on the top floor

73
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,455
To me I was on the top floor

74
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,879
So that kind of and then afterwards

75
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
So like

76
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Works out

77
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
About it that I had to take

Disappeared

84
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,535

00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
You're Beautiful song

105
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
They're coming for your balls

106
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
It's all over your God

107
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
Very few people

108
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
When they are

109
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
At juice

110
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Eczema

111
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
If that's a real name you're going to feel really a bear

112
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
Pulled up into a paper airplane

113
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Executed so far

114
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
The first matter

115
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
In front of us

116
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
Jordan I have here in front of me

117
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
It's a big book

00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
Confessions of the Illuminati of

119
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
An aluminum

120
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,127
When is the diamond out of here

121
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
The name is the same color graphic design

122
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,623
2nd edition of confessions of an Illuminati

123
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
About the Illuminati and the new world order by Leo Lions origami

124
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
The f****** DJ are worthy of a memoir and this but maybe that's in there I'm really excited

125
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
As soon as we hit the record

126
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
I'm diving in

127
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,455
Definitely going to be talking about

128
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
Game with a little note

129
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,111
I wanted to send you this complete

130
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Is a way of thanking you

131
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
I brought the great concept you put out over the years

132
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,143
Both of you enough for consistently excellent onset that's entertained during multiple

133
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
And learning how to paint miniatures

134
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
I think it's important for people to be introduced to right-wing.

135
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
Critical and well-thought-out

136
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,663
You're essentially inoculating people against these toxic etiology

137
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
I think the impact you both have had on

138
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Thank you very much

139
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
The Greek

140
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,647
I'm totally measurable I'm not saying that

141
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
I'm just saying that you can absolutely

142
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,607
Anyway

143
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,263
Clearly policy wonk Brent speed

144
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,359
I'd love to make each of you a Warhammer Mini

145
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
If there's anything you know about

146
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
The setting do you have any preferences

147
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
Thanks I don't know somebody who has any experience in that that

148
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Arena

149
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
Dungeons &

150
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Play figurines

151
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
I would assume that I would have to be like a bard

152
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
Or some kind of scholar

153
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
And then you would be deserter type

154
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,455
How do you love your life is great

155
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
Some sort of a lure where used to be chaotic

156
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,951
Grounded

157
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
Brent I don't know

158
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,607
I don't know anything about this but I think that's an awesome I would love to have miniatures

159
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:23,007
Love you so much nonsense in terms of the show talked about whether it be like the project

160
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
Camelot.

161
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
Yeah there's so much

162
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
Potential for weird lure

163
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,479
I think you could let your mind go crazy

164
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Something fun

165
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
You know

166
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Some kind of

167
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
I'm a nerd

168
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391

169
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,231
I want some sort of magician character you know what I was I was really really young

170
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,887
I was athletic and my friend was very much not athletic and in a reverse kind of role

171
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,471
A situation he would always plays the Barbarian strongman

172
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,055
And I would always play as the

173
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
And I've always irrelevant

174
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,735
There's a magic-user preferably

175
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
Violent temper

176
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
That works

177
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Give it to me

178
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,391

Call First is a great thing to say but unfortunately

186
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,791
Unfortunately

187
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,143

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Scenery

195
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
That's great

196
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Get to the

197
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
The Cauldron

198
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Early

199
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,247
You want to be able to turn all those machines that is true

200
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,903
Puzzle

201
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Farming

202
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Children's are a lot of fun

203
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
Yeah I found

204
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
The

205
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,351
Place that has like the special armor

206
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Behind the big lock

207
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,703
You know what I never got that I found that

208
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:07,359
Almost immediately and became obsessed with it as like a quest

209
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Kind of

210
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Kurt Meyer

211
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
Yeah I did but never did

212
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
I took me forever but I did

213
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Gator

214
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,975
You know because things you need in order to solve a court you can't do it. Parts

215
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,095
In the game getting really frustrated

216
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,471
You know don't get too bogged down in specific thing and just enjoy

217
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,847
It is a little bit like Assassin's Creed

218
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Is you with that

219
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:45,247
FirstLight aspect that you need to get the super armor but then you have to wait like 10 full chapter

220
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
By breaking it.

221
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
The last one yeah yeah

222
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Yeah

223
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
Cauldron

224
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,791
Override things

225
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Interesting mechanic

226
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,911
I also take your time with the hunting grounds

227
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
Completely side

228
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
That's a fun thing

229
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
I'm just calling

230
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Order some pie

231
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Covid

232
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Humanity

233
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Anyways

234
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
It gets introduced as a problem with our phone number and is that is the people might be trying to order tattoo

235
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
Address

236
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
I think we could run into problems

237
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Is there I did not think that

238
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:51,039
Through I would like to know if anybody called tap Bros

239
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,439
Is everybody going to get too smart of them on now future episodes

240
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,047
We got the phone

241
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,447
Jordan

242
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
On August 11th

243
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
Alex is getting

244
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
Pretty extreme about the coming election

245
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
They are now officially

246
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,895
Announcing a plan

247
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
When Joe Biden loses in a landslide

248
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
But they are going to have

249
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,743
I like this idea

250
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
I completely dividing this time

251
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Military attack

252
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Collapse

253
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
From within

254
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
The top story

255
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
So is he against secession now

256
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
10th Amendment

257
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Assertion

258
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
Is suspended 2009

259
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
He was he was in favor of that when their work was talk of gun laws

260
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,559
Okay please the Texas is its own country

261
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,631
And so therefore it

262
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
Could do whatever the parking lot right right right

263
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
I think this is actually

264
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
Honestly if this plane was true I think this is a win for Alex Wright

265
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,039
What are you going to be mad that you guys aren't the ones who get to secede where's

266
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Seating review

267
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:33,951
Essentially the same as use the seating for what

268
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,071
Alright

269
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,399
I don't want to play with you but I don't want you to not want to play with me

270
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,775
Probably

271
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:53,919
Just about what we talked about

272
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,479
Explored

273
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
Was the possibility of Biden not conceding re-election

274
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
You know like

275
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
It's basically the 2000 election but with a

276
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
The fight

277
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,863
Pretending is the official plan the primary

278
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,727
So that's where we're at think it's a great idea but we're just going to have to move Atlanta somewhere

279
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
It's my friend purple States

280
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
250 purple stuff

281
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
What song

282
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,975
Reversing that music video purple stuff

283
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Her big mouth

284
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
Recipes Big Moe by the way he died

285
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,679
Cody, what purple stuff is very sad

286
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Call T-Bird

287
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
Situation all over again

288
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,175
Video is amazing

289
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,271
Very weird unnecessary Willy Wonka

290
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
This next court

291
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,951
Alex said something that really got me excited

292
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Because it's one of those

293
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
One of the indications to me that maybe he's going to try

294
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
You know

295
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,935
Very pops when I was like I'm going to prove something

296
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
And I thought that's what was coming here but

297
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
Sure if you followed through

298
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Unbroken

299
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
All of which Infowars has discovered

300
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Which

301
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
No one even knows about

302
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
What is it about the credit

303
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
But I want lister's understand

304
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
One of the stories would devastate

305
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,447
I got so pumped because like

306
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
3 Strikes

307
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
Thanks, somebody's going to devastate the code

308
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,871
Number one and then I can take care of that

309
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
I'm going to take care of

310
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:09,087
He doesn't he doesn't really specify what three stories are I'm not sure he got to all three of them

311
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
We could guess if the 3r

312
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,719
Various things that are covered along way

313
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
Explicit

314
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
No

315
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
For sure

316
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,703
This is one of the three giant stories but Alex about something

317
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Actually allows me

318
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,847
To put into context something you talked about on a previous episode

319
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
There's hundreds of stories one everyday about all this lgbtq professor she died of Toby

320
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
Doesn't exist

321
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
Put out by Sia

322
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:48,511
Episode

323
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Covid death numbers

324
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Evolution

325
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
In terms of his rhetoric

326
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
10 things that you took

327
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,775
Most issue with was the lack of any specific details that would tell people what he was talking about

328
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
At least this time he's being a little bit

329
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
His story is about a Twitter

330
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Larimer

331
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,015
It was run by an account called sciencing underscore by

332
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
The accountant

333
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Reported to be in lgbtq indigenous

334
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,416
Professor at the Arizona State University

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,816
People who've looked into the details of the story of founded

336
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
To the person story don't match up with

337
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Reality

338
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Including claims of teaching

339
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Classes were in session

340
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,568
And the fact that ASU had no faculty members died of covid

341
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
19 in the time. When this person

342
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Send a text with.

343
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Tuesday

344
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Wow

345
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
Bethany

346
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:49,440
It's just a ways back

347
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,144
7 years ago

348
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Sorry

349
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
As far as the construction was

350
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,616
Inappropriate reference

351
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Is just

352
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
I don't know how many people

353
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
It's fine there's a great dad

354
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,392
A person's death was reported by Twitter account run by women

355
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,256
According to an article on heavy statement

356
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
I take full responsibility for my involvement

357
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144
In creating the app sciencing underscore by Twitter

358
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,752
Excusable I apologize that reservation to all the people I hurt

359
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,640
It's really hard to say exactly what's going on with this situation or what people's motivations were

360
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,736
Twitter account

361
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,576
According to be an indigenous anthropology professor at ASU

362
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,648
And that time. She tricked a number of folks

363
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Professor was a real person

364
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
And then she decided to pretend

365
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
She died of covid

366
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
19

367
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,584
This is what it looks like from the information that I can

368
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
This is why specifics are important

369
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:08,288
If you're a legend that there are fake people claiming to have died of covid-19 and this is the story you're talking about

370
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
We can engage with that response

371
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
And look at the

372
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,176
Details of the story

373
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
Is there is a Twitter

374
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,832
People do stuff like this all the time and it's one of the reasons why you're pretty careful with social media

375
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,440
There's absolutely no reason to pretend

376
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Alex is claiming it

377
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:32,608
41 there's no reason to think this Twitter Persona is alleged death is being included in any way

378
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,168
That's a complete fabrication of

379
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
What is mine

380
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,032
The second thing is that there's no reason for Alex to suggest that this was a worker

381
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Psyop specialist

382
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,784
Beyond just hurting an existing

383
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,648
What you end up doing when you act this way is that you really have muddying the waters

384
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,512
The Baseline story is about a really interesting and bizarre cases

385
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,216
Because of how Alex is speaking Sophie

386
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,056
It's easy for the audience to Come Away with the impression that things are very

387
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Different

388
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,688
If you didn't look into it you might think of the underlying story in the mainstream media

389
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
Is it a professor at asq it officially died of covid-19

390
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
Didn't actually exist

391
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
Any one of these three stories

392
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,560
You can easily see how the conclusion you be left with would be different based on the two different versions of the story

393
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,120
And that confusion is Alex's goal

394
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
Dancing twisting of reality

395
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,752
Desire to

396
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
And that's why specific

397
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Are so dangerous for him

398
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
Yeah when you first talked about it it was just

399
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Suggest

400
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,088
But you're not giving me anything to go on sale

401
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,440
Bring in that it's an lgbtq professor

402
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,536
I can find out what this is and I can say

403
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Story

404
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,192
Has nothing to do with what you're talkin about specifics

405
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
You know where it's like

406
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,592
Famous for

407
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
I need you to

408
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Confirm

409
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
She pretended

410
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
To be an LG

411
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Indigenous

412
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
I think so

413
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
That's the information I can find

414
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
But it appears that that is the case

415
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
And heavy

416
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,536
Does seem to indicate that

417
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
Confess to such

418
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
And in her apology

419
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,448
She wrote I apologize without Reza

420
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Oh

421
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,592
Now did she parenthesize pun intended

422
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Because

423
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
If you don't parenthesize that

424
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
Man your f****** with my head

425
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
Lawyers

426
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,168
This I think is one of Alex's three-story

427
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
No no

428
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
Stories

429
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
And it's um

430
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,200
Ue's he's taken an existing story in axios

431
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,552
He's pretending that he's gone to the bottom of a deeper reality

432
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
And then he just do some grocery

433
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Islamophobia

434
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,632
Hospital Association

435
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
From the CDC

436
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
Children's Hospital Association

437
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Almost all of them

438
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,104
24 years old

439
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
Gotham

440
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
Invaders islamists men

441
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
The children put them in school

442
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
In middle school with your daughters

443
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,184
Alexa

444
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
He's from Syria

445
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
Matchmaking your daughters

446
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Pharmacist

447
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Wow

448
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,176
Promise

449
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
Has is that

450
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,560
Deception ladies and gentlemen I thought your point was about an axios

451
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,120
Story

452
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Digital this app

453
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
It's okay

454
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
So let's refer to the details of the story

455
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,872
Coronavirus covid-19

456
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
Exactly

457
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Use

458
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,760
Being diagnosed with covid-19

459
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
So

460
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
Young women in

461
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,160
Sweden

462
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
We are meeting our Matchmaker

463
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
That'll be that's just disgusting

464
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:29,056
Trash but it's just say everyone

465
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,408
What started the Jim Crow era

466
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
Leaving now

467
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
Decide

468
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
About that axios

469
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
The reason there's some age

470
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,880
Confusion about the data in that report that is

471
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
What excuse

472
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,464
Reporting ostriches from the American Academy of Pediatrics

473
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,048
Is it the only thing that they can go on is state-level data

474
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,864
Each state is a different

475
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
Set smart

476
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,544
If you do go look at the data you can see this very clearly called out on page as one of the limitations

477
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Of the dataset

478
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
Yet Alex is still lying

479
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,224
There's only one state that list people up to age 24 and that's Alabama

480
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
From the page about data limitation

481
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,904
Reported children as ages 0224 and is excluded from some

482
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Figures

483
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
People compiling a report wreck

484
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,280
Recognize that this was outside the range of what they were talking

485
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,888
About Leslie throw things off

486
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,728
Tennessee and South Carolina included people from ages 02

487
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
20 but most States had to cut off of 7

488
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
1918 or 9

489
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
If you actually don't look

490
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Charts where the

491
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,688
That are being reported or taken from

492
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,016
You'll see a little disclaimer saying Alabama and Texas

493
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Excluded from figure

494
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,672
This is because the state-level data from Alabama was unreliable

495
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,768
And Texas was excluded because quote Texas recorded age distribution

496
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,072
For only 8% of all cases

497
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,168
Neither these states will be reliably sorted into this data set so they were

498
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Excluded

499
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,080
What does actually means is that the real number of child cases of covid-19 is higher than what's being reported

500
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,944
Cuz there obviously some children in Alabama and Texas who've gotten sick did you say that

501
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,992
The age range was only

502
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
Reported for 8% in Texas

503
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Yeah

504
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Decision

505
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
Someone has that data but it's

506
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
Just not reported to the

507
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
I don't know

508
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,888
Oh man it is over

509
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Survivor

510
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,800
Essentially what's going on is that Alex's misrepresenting something he doesn't understand about this

511
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:41,152
Report needs a misunderstanding exact opposite of the truth

512
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,224
You saying that these numbers are exaggerating

513
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,856
24 year olds

514
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
Thereby excluding also

515
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,744
The grocer number of people who are under

516
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Christine Sixteen years of age

517
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,096
Who tested positive in Alabama and Texas

518
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,400
The study raised and dressed his

519
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Concerned

520
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,776
Well before

521
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Think about stuff in it

522
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,920
That's a large part of

523
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
To higher education

524
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:26,720
Now also Alex is racist xenophobic islamophobic

525
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
That's maybe more

526
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Yeah that's fair

527
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,632
Since I've gotten to hear Alex and his natural

528
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,984
Yeah sometimes singing along to

529
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
Mayweather the highwomen

530
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,616
Places that he feels most at home

531
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,944
You know I mean you can go to a zoo

532
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
It's kind of depressing

533
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Cuz you know

534
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
In a cage

535
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
That's where it belong

536
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
This is Alex

537
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Kind of worried belongs

538
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,776
Saxophone is where I belong

539
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,760
So basically yes the highway.

540
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
You son of a

541
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
Body

542
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:54,016
There's something wrong with you

543
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
Future

544
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
Alex's natural environment

545
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:28,320
Letter

546
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:40,096
We didn't have that as Baba

547
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Perfect like

548
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
The position of his like

549
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,568
God damn Eagles a saxophone

550
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,896
Nonsense

551
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
Manchester playing Dave Matthews

552
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Let's move on with their life

553
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,552
I swear to God if he could do that for 3 hours

554
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
I mean

555
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
Is like General Patton

556
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Seriously

557
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
Giving birth if you want Frank just gave a small like little mini mini you pieces

558
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Just like

559
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,312
Distillation of insanity

560
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:27,712
Great he was like almost everyday

561
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,488
Censorship going on about conservatives giving away

562
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
Caramelo.

563
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,608
Sing anymore

564
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
It turns out that now

565
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,520
I can't use phone

566
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
Phone

567
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
When

568
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,968
Publican primary

569
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
How to use the telephone

570
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
Telephone service off

571
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
She's joining us today

572
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
To pay your bill

573
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
Sorry

574
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
Send text messages

575
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
That's a little

576
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
Infowars.com

577
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:27,872
Beer flags on the story entirely on a video

578
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:34,272
Laura Loomer recorded of herself

579
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
This mechanism would even work

580
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,536
Messages are most likely be delivered through third-party platforms like MailChimp for emails or

581
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Anyway

582
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
River provides literally no evidence

583
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,936
Transfer clients in the video

584
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Deceitful history I'm not going to

585
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Take her word on any

586
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
If you know if utility is blocking somebody from using their service like a phone or internet based on political

587
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
Beliefs than I do

588
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016
Yes I agree I just don't believe Laura Loomer the best

589
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
What's happening in this case

590
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
But look into this a little further

591
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,952
And take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt because I found this article on Breitbart

592
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,584
The article claimed that they had a statement from a Comcast spokesperson who said quote

593
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:25,472
We're reaching out to the campaign and has made a technical fix that will resolve this issue within 24 hours

594
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,568
We're continuously working to protect our customers for potential security

595
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:35,712
In this case our security platform which leverages widely used third-party threat intelligence services

596
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,808
Flags be texting provider used by Laura Loomer Scamp as a pet

597
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Potential Threat

598
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,928
Anyone using this texting provider would have had the same experience

599
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,792
Not only with our service but with any security service using similar threat intelligence list

600
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,120
These security alert had nothing to do with the contents under

601
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
Any communication

602
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Contact

603
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,752
Yeah I mean

604
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Texting

605
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,336
They called Nazi. Great

606
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
Yeah it's just she's not related to lubbers camp

607
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
The mass texting company that might not be very legit

608
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
Free texting

609
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
The kind of makes sense I mean she has bad associate with absolutely Shady people

610
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,096
Adjust reputable company to handle

611
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Even if this is the case

612
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
Has been responsive to the issue and is working to resolve it

613
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
This is at worst

614
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,104
Normal inconvenience someone might run into in their lives

615
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,456
Because people are invested in their identities

616
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,480
Whole thing becomes a

617
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,808
Plot against them because I'm so scared of their ideas

618
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,136
Luma releases a video playing the aggrieved

619
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,184
Conservative

620
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,000
People like Alex can report on that video

621
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,048
Unquestioningly accept

622
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
Because it also serves their purposes

623
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
It's their narratives

624
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,960
As is the case with so much of the stuff we see on Infowars

625
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
This is an instance of someone taking their own

626
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
Personal inconvenience

627
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,104
Broadcast

628
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
Conspiracies against

629
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
Laura's texting companies Shady's this ends up being reported its

630
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Conservice will soon have no phone

631
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
Make a reservation at a park in this ends up being reported as an agenda 21 take over state parks

632
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:25,024
Hey it's all just narcissism run-amok that's all

633
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
From Comcast

634
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Also said

635
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,632
We immediately flagged the text

636
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,424
Company called nikolaychuk text

637
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,008
That's alright that's alright

638
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,104
Well Cheska certainly more relevant than Manti Te'o so

639
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,688
Even though it's an older reference

640
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
That look

641
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Haha

642
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,464
Bloop single over the third base

643
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
I think one of the problem

644
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,912
Like the difference between how you and I engage with me

645
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
That that's your goal after you laugh

646
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Food challenge

647
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,152
And I can appreciate a Nikolai

648
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:17,760
Text you that I can appreciate that might not last.

649
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:24,160
I'm just probably not going to laugh at it

650
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,560
Nihilism

651
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
You're my dad all right that's what's happening

652
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:42,336
When I get a little laugh out of you I feel like it's an accomplishment that's why you can't

653
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,640
I feel like you can't give it to me on

654
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
I'll text you

655
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,600
That's

656
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,584
Headlines

657
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
I don't know

658
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Baby

659
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,312
Why are the whl's fake to Panda

660
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
Years ago

661
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,856
In 25

662
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,000
Correspond

663
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
Coming from Tara

664
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
It's a lockdown drill

665
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,984
Bravo Winter Haven early something far worse

666
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
Tubi

667
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Cotuit

668
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,552
Little Couple of important

669
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
Even though Alex Hughes

670
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
Accurately reading the headline

671
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,512
The first thing is a b article is from February 2010

672
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
Complaints about swine flu

673
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,448
The second thing is that Michael cemento the author

674
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,728
Credit on his byline

675
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,568
He's not listed as a scientist or researcher even a journalist

676
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,640
He's identified as a subscriber

677
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:28,320
No audience submitted op-ed published

678
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Holding it up to be

679
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
How's the columnist

680
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
Pimento it's a dodgy history

681
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,536
He seems to have made a brand out of telling people to calm down about

682
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
All right like it be ladies hold on

683
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:49,568
Commenter b*******

684
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Called the myth

685
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,640
Of heterosexual AIDS

686
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
So

687
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,991
So we've got a hero

688
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:03,391
El Cerrito climate change and Monsanto

689
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,231
Monsanto

690
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:12,863
161

691
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
Dude where he was employed

692
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Any written positive things

693
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:22,335
Justice system has been bought and paid for by a large multinational

694
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
Like Chevron or

695
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Monsanto

696
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,943
Answer your slip-up and not an instant

697
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Someone writing positive articles about 9

698
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,551
Even indirectly funded them chairs totally broadsword

699
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,951
That sounds right I'll break of 2009

700
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:44,095
This op-ed in Forbes is in no way conclusive and has nothing to do with the topics that Alex's pretending

701
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,679
There's no mention of the Rockefeller Foundation or of dr. fauci

702
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,775
This is just another example

703
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Story about what the article actually says

704
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
Articles and headlines are

705
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
Props for Alice

706
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,967
All the details are just things he's pulling out of thin air

707
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
Also just because it's funny

708
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,623
Michael cemento another article that he wrote is his

709
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
Calm down

710
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
Was about

711
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,839
Do vaxxers vaccines are great so I just

712
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,655
To love to engage with that article at some point

713
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
It seems like pretty much

714
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Almost everything that I can

715
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
Can find of him

716
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,567
He's accusing everyone of being hysterical about topics

717
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Play

718
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,063
Call Dad

719
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Vandals

720
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,207
Does have a headline

721
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
That is saying that the World Health Organization

722
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Sake Japan

723
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,167
Improve user-submitted on Forbes

724
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
This guy has

725
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,519
A decade-long track record of

726
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,079
Basically all of his work just be telling people

727
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,687
This medium post my dick back

728
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,647
Hysterical

729
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:18,047
What do we bother about slavery at the economy what are you doing it'll take care of itself

730
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,911
So what real long time Alex has been making

731
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Claim

732
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,751
Cdc's on materials

733
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,287
That vase a

734
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,871
That's a lie called tester false positive

735
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Glacier

736
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,735
Specifics about it

737
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
In this next clip

738
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
Alex Gibbs

739
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,879
Is an indication of where he's pulling that information

740
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
In from

741
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
And

742
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Again

743
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,999
He has to not be specific because when he does

744
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
It reveals this stuff

745
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
CDC

746
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Novel Coronavirus

747
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,471
Real-time are tprc diagnostic

748
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,311
VCR

749
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,991
Infection or co-infection with other viruses

750
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,695
This is one of the most

751
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
Damning instances

752
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Of Alex

753
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Playing game

754
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
So

755
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,631
This is just a straight line that he founded

756
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,215
The full sentences reading is quote

757
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,799
The 2019 novel coronavirus RNA is

758
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,383
Genetically detectable in upper and lower respiratory specimens during

759
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Infection

760
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
Positive results are indicative

761
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,271
Active infection with two 2019-novel Coronavirus

762
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,831
But do not rule out bacterial

763
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,623
Infection with other viruses

764
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,951
The age of detected may not be the definite cause of disease

765
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
You can easily see the trick Alex

766
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
Is playing here

767
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,071
He starts the sentence at quotes

768
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,143
Do not rule out grammar of descent

769
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,495
When you start the sentence that way it appears to be a command telling people to do so

770
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,359
When in reality the second starts with positive results

771
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
Infection but do not rule out

772
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,479
We just saying that a positive result covid-19

773
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,575
But also that doesn't mean the patient may not be suffering from another condition

774
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Also

775
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
It's a warning not to come

776
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:25,279
Exactly in proper context all this line is covid-19

777
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:31,679
Doesn't ultimately be more complicated

778
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,495
CDC says be thorough

779
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,103
Alex could not make this this representation without omitting

780
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
The beginning of that

781
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,991
So this is absolutely a case of him consciously lying about what the document says

782
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,551
Him repeating a report

783
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,343
It's someone else who's consciously lying

784
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
Without

785
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,183
Confirming it in anyway for himself

786
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
There's no

787
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:59,327
It's so specific the way the sentences been changed

788
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,119
To appear to be a command

789
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,727
I'm going to give this one to

790
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
Lower-level research

791
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
That kind

792
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:19,551
The strength second

793
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Important to recognize

794
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
Starting

795
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,927
From it's absolutely conscious

796
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,511
Like because that makes perfect sense yeah

797
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,351
And it changes meaning when you started in the middle

798
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
Just unacceptable that

799
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
Should be

800
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,751
Super Bowl I don't know maybe not maybe

801
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
Motherfuker

802
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,847
Lawsuit

803
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,223
Recalls on the show but specifically about

804
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,527
No

805
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Blue States this week

806
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:56,671
Open the phones up starting

807
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
Yesterday

808
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Call Annabelle

809
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,679
You take your view

810
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Secede

811
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,151
We're going to have our own operation and say

812
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Is the present

813
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
The military will have to decide

814
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:33,023
So Alex has decided

815
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,583
Commiserate about this because

816
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:42,239
That'll be some fun violent talk prepared for the thing that we are accusing them of

817
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
While we are doing it

818
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,127
Quite a while

819
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
Because he has something else

820
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
Directions to me

821
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
What

822
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
The last hour

823
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
That was an accident

824
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:05,279
So there's a number of things that I desperately need a correction

825
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
1

826
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
The complete misrepresentation

827
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
The guidelines about PCR test

828
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
It's made by chopping off the beginning of that sin

829
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:18,335
Alright I'll give you that this representation of the axios article about children with covid-19

830
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,615
People who were 24

831
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:24,223
And consider children were explicitly excluded from

832
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:29,343
Miss representation

833
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
4

834
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:34,463
He's taking Laura Loomer at her word about her dumb campaign for congress being sent

835
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
There are others

836
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:41,119
Journalistic fuk up that he's made in less than an hour of his show

837
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:46,495
Expected one of these should definitely be the thing that he's apologizing for

838
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
No it's not

839
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
I'm sorry

840
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
0.32

841
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
He's talking about the Texas death rate

842
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,367
0.32

843
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
From

844
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
0 point

845
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
Preacher

846
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,047
Suck it up again

847
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,095
1

848
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Sometimes worse than it is

849
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
It wasn't on purpose

850
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
0.32

851
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,895
0.03

852
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
So that's

853
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Is Big correct

854
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
Correct somebody misread a number

855
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,647
I mean to do a correction but also

856
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,719
There's more substantiv Corrections you need to be Focus

857
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
Seems a little distant

858
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:50,751
Don't think I don't think he was real meaning that is a full-throated like pageant out of that

859
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
Topology

860
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,687
Dismissive

861
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:08,159
I'm very comfortable

862
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:15,327
I'm sure 032

863
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
Fuc yourself

864
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:20,191
So anyway

865
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
Cases are going up

866
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,751
Places like Texas

867
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,919
Going straight down like a lead balloon

868
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,247
Section rate is going

869
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,575
Because

870
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,135
I just showed you the cdc's on website

871
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Infection

872
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
The flu

873
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
You were going to have

874
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,447
Cereal that we will also have even

875
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,799
19 this is just from that do not rule

876
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,383
He's pointing back to that that

877
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
It's a push it

878
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Just talked about the

879
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
Concept of time

880
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Haha

881
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
Alright

882
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
That somebody gets

883
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
Virus

884
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,719
What a two-week map 10-day

885
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
.

886
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,815
Virus

887
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,375
And when the symptoms start to really accelerate

888
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,423
So it suggests that

889
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
Hey straight was going

890
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
Then the death rate would

891
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
Follow

892
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
Later

893
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,895
Right and you can't really expect

894
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:39,295
Exact same trajectory as the first time cases were really getting out of control because we

895
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,855
You have more information than we had

896
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,975
Round

897
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,511
You expected

898
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
From

899
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,119
How it works

900
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
Timeworks yet

901
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,751
Expected

902
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
Goldust

903
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,151
You gets around to talking again

904
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,175
About this

905
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Historian

906
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
He wants to really report on this

907
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,855
Figure this out

908
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
Is Tech Guy

909
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
Computer Fletcher's is really smart guy

910
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,175
He has his own show

911
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,015
97000

912
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Nobody's dying. One of them

913
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,511
Lgbtq

914
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
Going for broke why not

915
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,167
Million live

916
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
That's not

917
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:06,335
Not good specifics

918
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,151
In terms of these

919
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
Big people

920
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
The kids got even real

921
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:20,671
You had to be real f****** careful Alex.

922
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,999
And I'm not even talking about be careful because I think you'll get sued

923
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,071
Be careful because of the consequences

924
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,631
That these types of narrative

925
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
You hurt innocent people

926
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:36,287
You want you want to do something that molynes like George W bush

927
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Like always

928
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
Try as best as you can to deal with reality on reality turn victimizes Georgia

929
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
W bush

930
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
You know Dubai

931
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,647
Things as best I can

932
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,695
I'm not worried about it as much

933
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
He's rich

934
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,743
Yes security

935
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,303
All that stuff

936
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,607
Individuals and private citizen

937
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,167
They can't be hurt by rhetoric

938
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
And narratives like this

939
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,007
Make it so much more

940
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,543
And you can't

941
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,335
You can't allow yourself to act

942
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,663
I think it's f***** up

943
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Is that

944
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,711
My reactions

945
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
To that is

946
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Like

947
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,807
In the context of Alex

948
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
I know he wanted to

949
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,111
Experience any guilt

950
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
The actual people

951
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
You know so

952
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,231
When talking about something like this

953
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,255
It's

954
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,815
It's so hard to remember to focus on like

955
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,631
He's not just going to get himself

956
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,679
He's going to hurt

957
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
You can't do stuff like that

958
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
You just can't

959
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,823
You can't do whatever you're doing

960
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,359
To Target

961
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
People

962
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Not least of which

963
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,247
Because I would

964
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Prefer to deal with the

965
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,551
Consequences of my own Acts

966
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
A second

967
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
Hands

968
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
So Alex gets into this paper

969
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,071
Actually really worried

970
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,703
These signs of like a delicious

971
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
This indicates to me like

972
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,847
Just completely

973
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Falkreath

974
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,967
It it was really scary

975
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Percent

976
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Them

977
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
Yellow is 0214

978
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,591
Testing positive

979
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Thunder 14

980
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
24

981
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,183
So there's absolutely no reason to suggest

982
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:07,583
Just because the state counts people who are ages 0217 as children

983
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
Must be 70 roll

984
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Which is what

985
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Suggesting

986
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,031
Yeah

987
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:22,687
Alex is not realize that only Alabama 24 in the definition

988
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,575
Explicitly says that Alabama data is excluded from

989
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:33,183
He'll he will die on

990
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,791
This is really weird to me because okay so there's like Florida

991
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,351
0214

992
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
Considered

993
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,751
I meant over bunch of other states are 0270

994
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:51,871
0217 that actually means

995
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,151
In 217

996
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,991
And Florida is the only state that even counting 0214

997
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:01,599
That's what I thought you said

998
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
Text banana

999
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,183
Credibly scary because

1000
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,511
That's either thinking that your audience

1001
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,583
Will accept that which is terrifying

1002
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Just

1003
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:18,751
Cognition and reasoning abilities that Alex has that's the conclusion that he's arrived at

1004
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,055
Which is scary

1005
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
027

1006
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Obviously

1007
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
The only 7

1008
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,015
Text help

1009
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:36,159
0217 means 14270 because there's another option that 0214

1010
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
These data sets

1011
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:40,767
From each state or independent of each other

1012
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,863
They're all colors on the map are to delineate which states

1013
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,727
0244 literally examining my eyes

1014
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,079
That's terrifying

1015
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
You see we just ripping holes out of my eyes

1016
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:02,271
And he's just making stuff up about this report

1017
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
Again

1018
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
The most danger

1019
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,879
Just think what he's doing is throwing around these accusations about fake.

1020
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,999
If you wants to genuinely talk about individual specific cases like that Twitter hoax

1021
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,535
He has the right

1022
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
Right to do so

1023
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,911
But to take that specification then extrapolate that out to yell about fake deaths

1024
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
Do children like you have been doing here

1025
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
Is onyx

1026
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
It's just completely unacceptable

1027
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
And like

1028
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,847
Only human

1029
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,151
I don't expect this to ever happen or this message

1030
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
To get across

1031
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Cease and desist

1032
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,551
Whatever you're going to do Alex

1033
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,111
But this is crossing a line

1034
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
In the past

1035
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,671
You should know is not good

1036
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
I can just not accept

1037
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,767
I'm making a citizen's put you in a little box

1038
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,815
Everybody else's safe for me

1039
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,863
Timeout yeah no kidding

1040
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,423
Boomers on the show now

1041
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,215
Towards the end of third hour

1042
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:59,615
Really for that hour but I turned it off after Laura Loomer

1043
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:00,895
I'm

1044
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
I'm 36

1045
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,991
Years old

1046
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,111
Description begins with R 3060

1047
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,607
Feel like

1048
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:26,239
I don't have enough time that I can listen to Laura Loomer on Alex's show be like

1049
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Give me some more

1050
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:33,663
We got 15 before the world

1051
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
Alright

1052
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,015
So Laura is

1053
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
Can hear about

1054
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
You know they're going to turn off

1055
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:45,951
Your phone's if you're from there

1056
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,047
Access to your internet service provider

1057
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,423
Actually already

1058
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,751
Garcetti

1059
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,055
People

1060
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
Social distance

1061
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
Turn your water off

1062
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,895
These are

1063
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:15,391
You can already see here that Laura is moving the goalposts a little bit

1064
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:20,255
The utility that pretty much everyone agrees that everyone should have access to his being online

1065
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
More like having a phone

1066
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
Your phone service

1067
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:29,215
Yes that's not the same thing as being entitled to use every single service that is online or you can

1068
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:36,639
If a particular company doesn't want to work with you due to your behavior being just tasteful or dangerous that's not the same thing as Comcast

1069
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,919
Not allow you to be online

1070
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
Where is blurring ventline on purpose

1071
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
Because the reality of her situation is

1072
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,807
The pretty weak grievance

1073
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,647
And she really wants to be seen as the oppressed hero telling truth to power

1074
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:52,511
I have so many people to look up on IMDb pan

1075
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:58,655
Please keep in mind that less than a year ago she was the co-host

1076
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,751
Where they went to Minnesota to try and prove the ilhan Omar was married to her brother

1077
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
She's not a serious

1078
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,591
And anytime

1079
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,383
Is Justified

1080
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:14,527
Answer the whole thing about LA mayor Garcetti threatening to shut off water and power to houses that are throwing parties

1081
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,111
He wasn't talking about houses that actually have like their peoples home

1082
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:24,767
These are big houses that are either vacant or used for short-term rentals that people are renting out to throw big parties in

1083
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,791
Because nightclub

1084
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Close down

1085
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,399
And this is Wade have your own little nightclub

1086
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:35,519
Used to record according to the LA Times

1087
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:41,919
The beginning Friday night is Los Angeles Police Department officers

1088
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:48,319
Property evidence that such Behavior

1089
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,647
The city shut off water and power services within 48 hours

1090
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
These parties are pretty out of control

1091
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,279
Even if you don't think about it just in terms of the pandemic

1092
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,631
His Times article discusses a recent party on Mulholland Drive it caused a

1093
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,911
Chart of neighbor complaint

1094
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,567
Many cars that were illegally parked need to be towed and It ultimately culminated in a fatal shooting at 12:45 a.m.

1095
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,359
People were shot

1096
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,151
Resulting in one death

1097
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,175
F****** Christ

1098
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
Palmini, considerate

1099
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,599
Regulate

1100
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
It's just yeah

1101
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:29,023
People like Laura and Alex

1102
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,303
Shearwater because you're nuts

1103
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,583
Submitting to their Authority

1104
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
Real reality

1105
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:36,191
Ice queen attempt to crack down on people using Airbnb mansions

1106
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,983
Ginger is parties

1107
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,799
You can agree or disagree with that tactic

1108
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
Welcome

1109
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:47,455
Make a pretty solid argument that's not the best way for the city to go about it

1110
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,503
I think you can make an argument

1111
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,527
Not a bad

1112
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,831
Whatever

1113
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
But

1114
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,391
You do have an obligation

1115
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,695
Resent the story as it actually exists

1116
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,279
As opposed to some Twisted paranoid fantasy about Renegade

1117
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Communist

1118
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,375
All this b*******

1119
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
She doesn't get to do

1120
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,679
If you don't advocate

1121
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
For Universal broadband

1122
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,519
Then you don't get to do that

1123
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,567
Because you're saying that this Corporation

1124
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Can kick you off

1125
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,639
Because you lost your job

1126
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
You're saying this Corporation

1127
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:22,015
Can kick you off because you don't have any generational

1128
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
Sucking well

1129
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,111
You're saying this Corporation can kick you off for any reason

1130
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,207
Because you didn't pull yourself up enough by your f****** bootstrap

1131
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,255
But you're saying that the corporation

1132
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,303
You can't kick you off or any other

1133
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,839
Like

1134
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
That's fine

1135
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,679
Yeah I don't know if I agree with you 100% I mean like

1136
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,519
I think ideally I do in terms of like yes I would I do

1137
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:49,151
You know that you shouldn't be able to

1138
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,503
Being hypocritical

1139
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,623
Under the current system that we live under

1140
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,671
Is differin

1141
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
Then being an a******

1142
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,999
I mean

1143
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:11,167
Operation can control what is ultimately what you describe as a human

1144
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,471
Irregardless of

1145
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
What their reasoning is

1146
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,311
Well I think it should be

1147
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,623
You can if you don't pay your bill during not dangerous for them to turn it on

1148
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:36,767
Idealistically based on the system that exists as it does now

1149
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
I don't

1150
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,095
Don't think that it's being hypocritical to say

1151
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,375
But it's different

1152
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:47,775
To say you're a conservative or even like you're an Alex Jones type do you have a phone

1153
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
I think

1154
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,431
You haven't paid your phone bill your phone is turned off

1155
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,479
It's different

1156
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:02,879
I just feel like a little bit like we can go to accept

1157
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
System

1158
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,207
I mean maybe it is but like

1159
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,791
It without changing the entire system there's no reason

1160
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,583
Okay and now we're Where We Are

1161
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,847
I'm coming at you with

1162
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
R-Truth dad

1163
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Truth in you

1164
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,015
No

1165
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,343
Admirable

1166
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
I meant look

1167
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,927
If we could find a way to craft

1168
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,975
Society where no one could be

1169
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
Thrown off

1170
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
Utilities

1171
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,303
Because they can't afford

1172
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,375
Yeah I think that's a better State of Affairs

1173
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Much preferable

1174
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,727
But I do think

1175
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,519
It stands now there's a massive difference

1176
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,823
Between ideological and

1177
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,127
In political denial-of-service

1178
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
That I agree there is a difference

1179
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Between the two

1180
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,063
Perfectly clear

1181
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,111
We're talking about utilities not company

1182
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
Yes.

1183
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:08,927
Lights

1184
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,207
Waters

1185
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,511
That those can be turned off his

1186
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Bananas

1187
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,559
But anyway

1188
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,119
Jeffy

1189
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:21,471
So

1190
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,799
Basically

1191
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
Strong arm talk

1192
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,615
About how he needs to win

1193
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,455
Lawlessness in this

1194
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
Be safe

1195
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:53,215
I said that 10 years ago

1196
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
Taters and

1197
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Uno

1198
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,023
Parentheses

1199
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
Straight white

1200
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,583
People and parentheses

1201
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:24,959
How do I score a this is just a larious Laura is giving her sales pitch

1202
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:29,055
For her Congressional run record

1203
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,359
What are you doing

1204
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,647
Is in the negative d.c. in

1205
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:48,767
Breathing t.i. you've never made a promise ring

1206
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
He played earlier

1207
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
You know

1208
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,687
Czerny Seymour

1209
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
You sure

1210
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,783
I love the idea of turning these until I

1211
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,183
Positive

1212
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:23,583
Joining Jake Harrison.

1213
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
Dorsey by embarrassingly handcuffing myself to one around here

1214
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,799
Embarrassingly

1215
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,591
Undocumented

1216
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
People

1217
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,895
To Nancy Pelosi's house

1218
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,711
Think she might be patterned perceive

1219
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,207
It's incumbent upon you to

1220
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
Technology

1221
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:57,375
Take these embarrassment and turn them into

1222
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:02,495
Success yeah I want to go back and see what actually happened with hurricane

1223
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,639
He was just like you did not clean up that s*** at all that was Genesis

1224
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:15,039
Job mr. Magoo antiquity

1225
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
Story

1226
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:22,975
Tradition Works call Mike got it

1227
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:28,351
Golden Fleece in a thousand years I'm going to be real pissed

1228
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,143
What we should do

1229
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,935
I mean I studied homeric Greek

1230
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,495
In college

1231
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
Association with

1232
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,335
Call Kelso

1233
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
Worked with my

1234
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Greek professors

1235
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,991
A oral tradition Journal

1236
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,879
All the oral tradition journal and I've learned a lot about

1237
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,415
Aldi DeSoto

1238
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,975
Inside the Dead the world

1239
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,791
I think we should start our own oral tradition

1240
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:02,911
But around these people

1241
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
Isaac

1242
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,727
That we should do

1243
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,007
Start telling

1244
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:13,407
Mythological stories about the various characters

1245
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
Jon rappoport

1246
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,807
Okay we never write down

1247
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,647
We all tell each other over and over again

1248
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,231
With the hopes that when Society does inevitably Fall Apart

1249
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,535
These will be the stories

1250
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:34,143
Do you realize that six months out of every year

1251
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
We

1252
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
Get Summer

1253
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:41,055
Because Laura Loomer turned to look back at that.

1254
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:44,639
Absolutely stories

1255
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:51,295
Will be telling around the campfire

1256
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,343
2000 years from now

1257
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Maybe

1258
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,951
Jordan

1259
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,511
We're done here with this episode

1260
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,583
I mean

1261
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
Videos that

1262
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,447
Strand of

1263
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,495
Alex becoming a

1264
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,055
Increasingly comfortable talking about the idea of

1265
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
Steak deaths

1266
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,127
Ryan the covid-19

1267
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,943
And that's me think is really the most important

1268
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,479
Something to keep an eye on

1269
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
There's a lot of

1270
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,111
Instances of just like

1271
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
Like you slip

1272
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
Like he uses these specific

1273
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,767
You're able to be like okay

1274
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Is just total b*******

1275
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,839
And that's just his game

1276
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
It's normal

1277
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
This introduction

1278
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Again

1279
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
Into something that's

1280
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615
So highly about

1281
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,687
Chanel and so important

1282
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,503
Is really dangerous and really troubling

1283
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,271
Think about the future

1284
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,551
Yeah in retrospect

1285
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,575
Like the idea that we

1286
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,855
Considered

1287
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Because

1288
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,183
We we considered

1289
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,719
How bad does it have

1290
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
To get before he

1291
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,791
Switches up you know

1292
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,071
How many deaths

1293
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
How many

1294
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,375
Cases what's the number

1295
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,423
And what we should have been talking

1296
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
About it

1297
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,495
The real inevitability of it which is

1298
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,311
How does one rationalize

1299
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:21,407
Right that's the only way that he could really go you know it was just

1300
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,199
This was where we were going

1301
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:27,039
Episode

1302
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,599
When we when we first started touching on this stuff

1303
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,647
There's such a massive difference

1304
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,183
Between

1305
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,535
Clerical admin kind of cover-up stuff

1306
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Switching

1307
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,095
Something

1308
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,887
Interact

1309
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,911
Fake people

1310
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,775
Cooking the books on this isn't a felony this is a misdemeanor

1311
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,359
Versus something that would require active participants

1312
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,175
Cover up

1313
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,319
It's it's such a different type conspiracy

1314
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,135
It's so much more Danger

1315
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,695
The difference I would look at it between like

1316
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
Weed and heroin

1317
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,535
It's like if you have a friend is smoking a lot of weed

1318
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,607
Saigon

1319
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
I don't know even the best

1320
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,703
Example these days

1321
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,127
Abused it

1322
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,687
I do

1323
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,991
Find the alcohol

1324
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:35,647
You have a friend is drinking a lot.

1325
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:41,279
Don't need to intervene immediately it's really out of control

1326
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,351
You got someone you know doing heroin

1327
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
Like this

1328
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,239
Type of narrative is

1329
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
Is heroin

1330
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
This is the hard drug

1331
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:00,479
But you're not going to escape kill you the first time you do it maybe won't kill you the second

1332
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
3rd or 4th

1333
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,039
But it will kill you

1334
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,063
Yeah it's the 14

1335
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,927
This can't like you just

1336
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,463
It's unacceptable

1337
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,279
I really really hope that it doesn't

1338
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:16,607
In progress any further because I don't want to watch this happen again

1339
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,447
The story of

1340
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
2020

1341
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:27,615
I'm sick of watching this happen again

1342
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
