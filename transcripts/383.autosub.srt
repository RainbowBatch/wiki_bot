Air Jordan X swetik

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Play Everybody Dance

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
We are recording this of course on New Year's Eve

6
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Let me ask you a question

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
2

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
One has anything good happen to you this year Dan one good thing

00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,944
Good things

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,528
This has been a really good thing

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
Grounding video

12
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,672
The growth of the show and the wonderful things that year from listeners and

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Oh that's it's very

14
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,816
And I'm moving

15
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,936
Are also playing a sexy

16
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
It's been tough 2019 is a rough year.

17
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
Back about other stuff will you be in a touchdown on the show

18
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
Like I you know the plant

19
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,832
Still no right

20
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
Still alive doing okay as last

21
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
Plantera

22
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
What no what no fruit I don't know what's going on yeah do we need to close up any narrative arcs around 2019 that we ever been

23
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
Still no fruit

24
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
I think I've hit I finish

25
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
The rough draft of a novel

26
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
You just finished the first time I finish

27
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Now I'm rewriting

28
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,296
It's terrible.

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
You can always

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
Like pretend that that's what 2019 was for you

31
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
Forget about not worried about getting fired in the whole drama

32
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
Protecto none of that

33
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
The background and all that's left

34
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,728
And that leftovers left

35
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Right now I'm going to be poor

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
Let's leave this year behind hell yeah

37
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
The faint memories of

38
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,992
My plants are still alive intro to rough draft

39
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,552
So Jordan is a show where I don't know much about the

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
But I do know a bit about Alex Jones

41
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
We're recording this on New Year's Eve

42
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
And ID

43
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
What what what should we do

44
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
What should we do here

45
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
And I thought like babies

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
New Year's Eve

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Uses of Alex's

48
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Will be better than the Y2K

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
We already did that we nailed that

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
So I thought that why not see how Alex closes out 2019 on his own show

51
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
December 31st

52
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
2019

53
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Really interesting show Alex

54
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
Houses in bad shape

55
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,144
I was unable to avoid the very very bad news

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
Steve today

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
That news we were talking about is there were articles that came out yesterday as we were recording this on the 30th

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Yes that Alex

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,992
And Infowars had been

60
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Basically

61
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Contempt

62
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,648
Of court for their deposition Behavior among other things

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
And so it added up to

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
Penalties of about $100,000

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,327
But Alex and Infowars

66
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
And and for all intensive purposes

67
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
Infowars is Alex

68
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
Absolutely so he just got hit with a pretty sizable

69
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Fine

70
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Has nothing

71
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,919
To do with the outcome of the case so like what if he ends up being found

72
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,759
Guilty in the Civil Trial

73
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,623
That's going to be whatever that is plus this hundred dollars or hundred thousand dollars

74
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
Lucy's on the hook forwarded no matter what

75
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:51,839
And to what the thing is I thought about that and I thought about like a course we got to do the 31st cuz I got to get Alex's

76
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,959
Response to that but if you read those articles that ruling came down on December 20th

77
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Yeah so

78
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
You could go back to our episode about the 19th of 20th and now listen to it with that content right where you can sense

79
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Any additional anger

80
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,807
You just seemed a bit racist I don't know if that was because of the Jeff

81
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Everybody's going crazy

82
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
Now it seems like he was

83
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
Yasuke

84
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
Episode today there I don't

85
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,143
I thought about the possibility that like Alex could be responding

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,239
To the news of the fine Ryan him

87
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Isn't news

88
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Define he's known about for 10 days

89
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,151
Course up to this point so he's had plenty of time to adjust to it

90
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
I don't really see much of a response

91
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Fox to the news break

92
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,343
Watch episode in general

93
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
I mean this world is crumbling around him

94
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
I do think it's really cool though that

95
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,655
The courts do have a mechanism to punish Rob do

96
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
I screwed is this legal

97
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
And like

98
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,895
Well he's not going to jail but no it is not legal to be that old

99
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
Yeah turns out there are consequences for basically

100
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Quit playing dumb

101
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
In

102
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,183
In a situation where you're required to not play dumb

103
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Toledo

104
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Yeah so that's that's a positive

105
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,095
It also really indicates that Alex is scared of rhabdo

106
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
It's cost him like I think that portion of it is like something like 60 something thousand

107
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,895
Either he really doesn't want to answer those questions or robbed

108
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Is worth

109
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
$7,000 fine

110
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Because he knows too much

111
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Whatever the case

112
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
It's nice to see these

113
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
These consequences

114
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
I will see you how much more

115
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
Hands up, there will be more

116
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
To see them pulling out of his debts

117
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
If past is Prelude he's got a lot more fine

118
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Coming up

119
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,751
Oh yeah so Jordan will get down to the 31st

120
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,615
There's some actually kind of interesting things going on in here along with

121
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,455
I would say that most of this episode is

122
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Sort of like

123
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
What is the clock strikes 12 those fines don't mean anything not nothing to do with this really feels like

124
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Trying to run down the clock

125
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
For most of the ship

126
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,935
Imported becomes why even do it right

127
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,823
He's just staring at the clock without somebody waiting till 3 p.m. at

128
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Clock

129
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,015
And we get down to business on all that before you could take a moment to say thank you to some folks who signed up and are supporting the show

130
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783

Belovely

174
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
So Alex starts off the show talk

175
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
A little bit about how he's getting a lot of prey

176
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
Press and he's gotten

177
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Surprise

178
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:46,751
And you might think while some of its prices coming from articles about how you just got to find a hundred thousand dollars you think that

179
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Some other press

180
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Is coming from other Avenue

181
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Alex seems to think

182
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Give it a lot of it

183
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Do with him getting that

184
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087

00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
The very seriously what is that One Winged Angel

186
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,279
Very intent

187
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
I was standing on the maze

188
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,871
Infowars musician Austin Texas and I was watching the armored vehicle roll out

189
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
The Sun

190
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
Knowing that Owen Shroyer

191
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Airplanes and fly

192
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
The East Coast

193
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
I can't focus

194
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Trip

195
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
Was fabulously

196
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Successful

197
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Imagine if we had

198
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Cruise

199
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Marcia Cruz

200
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Everywhere the leftist

201
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Taking over the media

202
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
All because of one little innovation

203
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,599
An armored vehicle with mounted bull horns

204
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Blasting out

205
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,487
I don't think I've heard almost anybody talk about Alex having a tank

206
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
I believe we are the only people who have ever talked about Alex have a good time

207
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,935
I've seen a couple tweets every now and again like looking his ass

208
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:26,079
And I think that really goes to like a Hillary rally people yell at him in the tank but I think they'd yell at him anyway

209
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
IPhone speak to nobody

210
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
Like a Tedesco escalation

211
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Sublevel

212
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
I have not read anything is that Hill about

213
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
No

214
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
Certainly as not been

215
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,487
No one's getting it into a fit about it I think most people think it looks desperate

216
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
She has to be the I don't know

217
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
I think that the news coverage that Alex has gotten

218
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
Largely is about these

219
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Stalling tactic

220
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
But he's trying with the Sandy Hook lawsuit

221
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,591
And then another one was Will Johnson one of his reporters

222
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
Pretending to not be an Infowars

223
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,223
Employee let me know that you didn't got on the other mainstream news

224
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
So like yes okay

225
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
You doing shity things in

226
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
This lawsuit

227
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
And you're reporters acting

228
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
Blatantly on ethically

229
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
Yes that is getting people a little bit like a what the f***

230
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Cuz wrong

231
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
Write the tank does not know a believe it was

232
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
Non-factor know everybody saw that tank

233
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,751
And they were like unlike whenever people get a

234
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Massive Homer or something like that clearly composite

235
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Waiting for something

236
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
He is getting that tank because he is right on

237
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Dababy

238
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,503
He's trying to make up for his desperation

239
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
So in this that in this next clip Alex talks about how like this

240
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Is people waking

241
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Outrageous

242
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
That's why Infowars needs

243
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Stay on the air

244
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
More life sales pitch

245
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
I really think that there's something very interesting in this

246
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
After the clip I'm going to translate for you

247
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Actually say okay

248
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Is it sounds

249
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,775
Like you saying something but he's actually saying something couple

250
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,407
And we understand just how evil and just how corrupt just how committed to evil

251
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
Blood blister minions are but a lot of people are sick

252
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Still naive that

253
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
They're awake they know they're being lied too but they haven't really

254
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Gotten their bearings yet

255
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
People are ready to be fully awoken

256
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
We have to be there to do it

257
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
Dangerous

258
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Gamble

259
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
The technocracy the Chinese social score system

260
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Early

261
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Across Europe

262
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
The UK

263
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
I'm here as well

264
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
So for those of you who don't speak Alex

265
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,135
What Alex says the people are waking up but they're naive and don't have their bearings

266
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,207
That's why Alex needs to be on are to guide them and help them

267
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
What he's really saying is that things like the Epstein didn't kill himself meme or serving his prime radicalization pipeline

268
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
But he can't exploit if he's not on air

269
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,263
Things like that grow and touch the lives of people who would be otherwise

270
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Completely unacceptable to Alex's bulshit

271
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
And seeing people starting down that road and not being able to guide them into his Revenue stream is driving Alex up a wall

272
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
He's basically saying that these people are money on the table if you can do

273
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Just direct them into his

274
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
Hey the globalist of the bad guys

275
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Yeah I was just

276
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
It's just money on the table

277
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
When he needs to be on there to collect it

278
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,791
People who are awake but naive are just

279
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
An untapped Revenue

280
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,679
They are a market I am not in and I need to be

281
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
I would prefer he brought back John Williams

282
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
From now on when

283
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
As for the social credit score stuff that he's talking about

284
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,663
I was just saying that he's mad that his actions have consequences

285
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,759
Companies like Twitter and Facebook don't want him to spread his bulshit on their plant

286
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
That's not a Chinese social credit score that's just what happens

287
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,695
People who show that they're incapable of being trusted with platform

288
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
What Alex

289
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Just talkin it all sounds like big

290
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,095
Talk and isn't there some sort of a geopolitical truth behind what he say

291
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Ben reality

292
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
It's just that he sees money on the table

293
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,751
And the people taking him seriously has made it harder for him to

294
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
To get that money

295
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
That's all he's saying

296
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,663
It really strip away a lot of the veneer in the pretense in the

297
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
The decorations in the

298
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Stupid

299
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Turn the phrase It's just

300
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,111
There's a lot of f****** suckers that I'm not being able to talk to her

301
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
To get me to the

302
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
There is there

303
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
They're waiting

304
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
There there

305
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Ready for me

306
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
The Primes

307
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
To take what I say

308
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Might be

309
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,911
I have bring forth like

310
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
What happened

311
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
My former lawyer very similar to stimulants

312
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
So let's get everyone on them

313
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Yes

314
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
It's kind of an unfocused beginning of the show but Alex

315
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Text the whip on him

316
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Southend Claire's

317
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
The dis

318
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
It's going to be

319
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
A disciplined broadcast okay

320
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Discipline

321
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
Podcast

322
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
Because 20 years ago I was actually

323
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
15 years girls were disciplined

324
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Stroke

325
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,751
Grounding

326
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
Game-changing transmission most hated

327
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
Broadcast worldwide

328
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
And take the show seriously and be doesn't want to take bets on whether or not he follows through this

329
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
For the whole thing

330
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
I think he thinks

331
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
He specifically talking about

332
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
Today's Show

333
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
December 31st there's going to be a discipline show okay

334
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
What's the overall I'm going to go with

335
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
3 minutes before he goes on a ramble

336
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
I made it might not even be that cuz he starts to get really pedantic about whether or not tomorrow and we're golden

337
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,991
January 1st is that a new decade

338
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Yeah that's a discipline

339
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
It's really really

340
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:02,207
Hyper focused on this really if by the end of this clip you'll see that it's actually

341
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Adjust

342
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
A way of getting into bigot

343
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
Told that it is

344
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
Do you know that but the fact that it was a debate

345
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
1999

346
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
The media couldn't wait

347
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
To say that

348
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
We

349
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Ended

350
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Christ death

351
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Resurrection

352
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
They were so excited about staying we were into a new

353
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
Millennia

354
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Not just to New Century that

355
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
They told everyone

356
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
2000

357
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
This was the end

358
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
20th century

359
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
We're not doing

360
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
We're not doing

361
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
Men can have babies

362
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
They cannot

363
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,143
Okay alright I didn't realize

364
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
I realized it the dick at a party in New Year's Eve is like well it's not actually the news

365
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
If you real with there is no year zero also

366
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,687
I don't think of trans people exist

367
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,039
I'm going to misinterpret that entire conversation the people they're having cool

368
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
I think it is really

369
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Fun

370
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
The way Alex

371
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Really focus

372
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Kristoff

373
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:42,815
Because I have a really hard position on this on the decking is this a new decade

374
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
You know what it is

375
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,567
Who cares

376
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
We're having a good day

377
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,199
You know how we group time

378
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
But it's also very

379
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,367
Up For Debate you know a lot of people who believe that the the 70 is obviously

380
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Didn't start on in 1970 and end of 90

381
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
279

382
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Same with the

383
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
The 70 started in 68 and ended in

384
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,607
Or whatever

385
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Didn't we colloquially talk

386
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Decades and in a lot of different ways

387
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Who cares

388
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
You don't need to be this dickish

389
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
Epoch

390
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Eras

391
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,967
They're all based on the base 10 system and how dare you you're totally right there like

392
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Like it just like it

393
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
If I were to hear

394
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Somebody talkin

395
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Yes I would either try and f*** with them

396
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Orally

397
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,183
I've no interest in this conversation of

398
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,583
Do you know next year's leather jacket really start

399
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
2000

400
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Birds 20

401
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
22

402
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Just don't care

403
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
So Alex

404
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Is mad that the people are saying that

405
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
But men can get pregnant

406
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,335
Sure of course and that it's a new

407
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
Here's where it gets strange

408
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,199
I believe that a lot of the

409
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Conversation

410
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
That goes

411
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Surrounds this issue

412
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
Is about people assigned

413
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
As women at Birth

414
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Trans

415
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
Yeah I believe this is

416
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
The conversation that I've heard people have

417
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Okay

418
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
Do you know someone who is a man

419
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,423
Right I can get pregnant but still has a fully

420
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,287
As we've seen a couple cases of this that have been in the news

421
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
These things come up every now and again these

422
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Situation you are

423
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Now Alex

424
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
Seems to think there's something else going on

425
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Which

426
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
I find

427
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,087
Trouble they're putting test tube babies inside men you back

428
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,743
Aldi genetically engineered artificial

429
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,863
Can I rig something up and grow some shriveled poor human in there and like the Bennetts lilac

430
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
Baby

431
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
Yeah they can pretty much already do that

432
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
Man didn't have a baby

433
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
Human soul was abused and tortured

434
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
Hell-bent on playing God

435
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
Could you back that up with anyting

436
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Hair

437
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Tornado on Airline

438
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Forget about it once I get on air

439
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
What

440
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
What is Abaddon

441
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Does jarring

442
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
Mad scientist

443
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
The doctor

444
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Frankenstein

445
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
Torturing

446
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
Open Solid I really should have put my

447
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,744
Where are these people putting the baby in the man

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,584
Where are they putting the soul

449
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Birthday

450
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Shriveled

451
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,776
I don't know I would like him to yeah I would like a citation on that I would like

452
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
But it does

453
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
It doesn't know

454
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
Because there's big news that is broken

455
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
In the morning

456
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
Evolve 31st and of the

457
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:18,880
Protester militia types I'm not entirely sure what the correct nomenclature would be

458
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Still sort of an evolving

459
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Situation even as we're recording

460
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
Storming the embassy in Iraq

461
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
Yes yeah and Alex because they have

462
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
So many babies in their Dilaudid

463
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
They got a

464
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
They got to get out

465
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
That might be a part of it

466
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
That's not Alex's report

467
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,848
I think that this should be a little bit of a if he case for him

468
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,664
I believe they're based on the things

469
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
Who's that he has espoused as his belief system

470
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
You should

471
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Not really have

472
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
A hard take on this okay

473
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
But

474
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
It seems like he does

475
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,208
And it seems to be that he wants

476
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Like because Trump has blamed Iran

477
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,352
Shadow Alex's to that's kind of out that's where he's at

478
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
Continuing there's a Washington Post

479
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
Protesters chanting death to America

480
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
Breakin the US Embassy

481
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Protest

482
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
So I guess if I went down to federal building broke into it and beat people up and Amy guns out of and then burn something down

483
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Armed protesters

484
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Kids

485
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Weird lime okay

486
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,888
I would start to all the time about how like once this ship pops off they're going to go around killing all the

487
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:38,496
Pocopson Lake how the book unintended consequences of going to come real

488
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Oh that's

489
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
They would be well within their rights to murder him immediately I believe is what he just said I mean I guess

490
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Yeah

491
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
At the same time

492
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,832
Talks all the time about how are illegal or in a rock is

493
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
Killed 100,000

494
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Civilian

495
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,560
And there's no reason that the civilians would have any interest in screaming death to America

496
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
Nuanced case for Alex

497
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
I don't care myself

498
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
You should have

499
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
The position of like

500
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,776
This is the globalists trying to do what

501
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Trying to the

502
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,128
Make it the Ron's the bad guy but he's awake

503
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
He's playing it

504
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Weird

505
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
It will

506
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,504
It will never cease to amaze me how

507
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
Many

508
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
And very

509
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
End

510
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
Tim near-infinite the amount of a mistake

511
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
Pixar made towards Iraq and Iran

512
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
Based on

513
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Singular snap

514
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
With no nuance

515
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
And how committed they are to

516
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Continuing to make

517
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
Yeah that's one of the reasons why I don't really want to talk about the actual event all that much because I have I do not have a

518
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
A good handle on what's going on

519
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
Hood at the time that we're recording

520
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
So I

521
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,480
I'm speaking primarily from

522
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
Alex likes to make Snapchat

523
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
Right Alex

524
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,344
Express various positions in the past

525
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,720
You'd think that this input would lead to a certain output and get it doesn't

526
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,536
We cleared it is very much focusing on

527
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
Aaron being a bad guy

528
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
And that he's insistent

529
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Enroute

530
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Heatedly

531
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Repairing it

532
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
To the Iran hostage crisis

533
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
In the 70

534
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Oh that's not good

535
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,360
Right and so he he brings it up as

536
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
The only way he can really

537
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
We frame it is

538
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
You know if you don't go in

539
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
In the just shoot these people who are trying to get into the end

540
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
You're going to allow them to pay

541
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Take hostages and then we're back

542
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,368
Into the 7th

543
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,720
And so you talked about that and then you blame you will be able to get onto planes easier again

544
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
Any blame Soros

545
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
Specifically

546
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
The Deep State derail Trump's another

547
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
1980 hostage crisis with Iran

548
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,032
Iran's runrepeat that obviously

549
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,824
The Deep state

550
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
John Kerry George Soros Hillary Obama

551
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,016
Jab Shadow policy and the derail with Trump's been doing they've admitted that

552
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
Prove any of this

553
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
Can't do it there's only one guy that we can

554
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Specifically prove has

555
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
A shadow foreign policy in place

556
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
And it's not the people he knows

557
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,376
No I know that later in this episode Alex says that

558
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
John Kerry was involved with the Iran deal with you no more

559
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,080
One from the 80s or nuclear

560
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
The nuclear

561
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Any piece of evidence

562
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
Throws out in terms of like these people are working with Ron to create another hostage crisis

563
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,648
Work that's not enough that's not enough

564
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:42,048
Yeah I mean you can put your it to shift your little finger pointing to Soros and the Deep state

565
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,632
Whatever it's very thin and he doesn't support this at all

566
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
And I think that's one of the reasons

567
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
But he ends up

568
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Stalling

569
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
For almost all of this episode

570
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,920
Is good to really doesn't want to talk about this story and much specific detail

571
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,992
So you just Rambles about how great his staff is

572
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,808
For a little bit

573
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
He's not talking about Rob

574
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,744
In this clip while bragging it's better on

575
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
And in service of talking

576
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Samoan

577
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Alex ends up saying a few things

578
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
Michael Jordan

579
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,968
Call either top Hollywood people in

580
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Oh

581
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
For my future my children's future that's a guy that

582
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
Has the will not

583
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,352
Global's do to him but he platform-wide about or BB

584
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
He just gets stronger in the face of it

585
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
So fake

586
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
I think Owens got blackmayo on Alex

587
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
That's

588
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
That's an insult

589
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
That is not a comp

590
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,528
Compliment Owen Shroyer that is an insult to Owen Shroyer the idea

591
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,112
The very idea that you would legitimately entertain

592
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
Michael Jordan but let me tell you something about Owen Shroyer that is a veiled insult

593
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Two gigantic problem

594
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Navigate 3

595
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,288
One is Alex's Michael Jordan and other top Hollywood

596
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
Favorite movie

597
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
I don't know why that's the grouping

598
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Bestway

599
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,760
I don't know what that's the grouping of people Michael Jordan and big

600
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Top Hollywood

601
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
The owner of the Charlotte Hornets

602
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Of course Robert Redford

603
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Second problem what the f*** did you

604
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
You meet Michael Jordan

605
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,216
It's on Bulls game at San Antonio or something you can't play the Spurs and you yelled at

606
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,264
No baby when he was young

607
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,664
He was he was taken to one of the Houston Rockets Bulls playoff games

608
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,224
In the same way I met Kobe Bryant

609
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,576
I got his autograph when I was 16 or 17

610
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
Not mad at you met Kobe Bryant and Radford you know everybody

611
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Foreshore

612
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah I don't believe any of that show

613
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,608
So Alex gets to his top story and of course

614
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
It's that the Chinese government is

615
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
Is taking over the world

616
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Car as is a story Everyday right

617
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,104
And I'm only keeping this clip in because Alex says something weird

618
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,408
In the middle of it that I want to unpack a little bit

619
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
I just don't understand

620
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,784
Walk up and say hey what you want to call the article

621
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Everyday

622
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
With a headline about the live feed of the show in what

623
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Maine

624
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Really is the shy contact over the planet

625
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Abortion

626
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
A metaphysical abortion

627
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
Horrible monstrosity

628
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,640
Rolling out from between his serpent mother's legs

629
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,456
So I would like to kill Grendel in utero

630
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,576
What's metaphysical abortion let that

631
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Set just

632
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
That's a piece of art

633
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:24,512
I want to admire that I want that quote to be on a poster I would look at it whatever I'm

634
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,096
Disappointed in myself he does continue on with like a Beowulf riff

635
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
Like we need my walls becoming choked out Grendel's mom

636
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
Sir

637
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,336
What was the greatest mob or something

638
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Oh boy

639
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
I don't I don't know what metaphysical aboard

640
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
I just don't I just don't know

641
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
I mean are we talk

642
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
Because some metaphysical abortion

643
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,648
Can still be done with with a pill

644
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
Could be any vacant even be prescribed

645
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Across state

646
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,816
But some metaphysical abortions require more

647
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,888
Involved process I'm thinking that what are you saying

648
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:06,496
Is that he is in favor of nipping things in the bud

649
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,824
Like the Chinese World takeover and then he's calling

650
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,384
That abortion metaphysical abortion

651
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
It's strange phrases

652
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
I think if you were like

653
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,296
Stridently anti-abortion like Alec

654
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,392
Maybe not good to call some of your aspirations

655
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Metaphysical abortion

656
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Right well

657
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:32,096
Seems weird that he wanted to kill Grendel's baby in the world

658
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
Ilana boarding fall on a boarding when does a monster become a monster

659
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Frindle become Grendel

660
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,384
I don't know probably waiting

661
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
So Alex

662
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,016
In service of not getting to any news

663
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
He goes to calls

664
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Very early at the show

665
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
Right almost

666
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
Maybe within the first half-hour to go

667
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Discipline broadcast

668
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
Yes so here is I

669
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Launching a

670
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,352
Calls by this

671
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
Canada

672
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Rehab in Canada

673
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,752
Is our first caller thank you sir for Johnny's go ahead

674
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
So Alex is lying this is

675
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,128
Is not the first time in a few years that he's going to calls really early

676
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,712
Wasn't Jeff again

677
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
What is an All-Star

678
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Okay bye

679
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Alex

680
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
You might remember

681
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
That recently promised he was going to have an in-studio surgery

682
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,048
A microchip homeless person

683
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,472
Alta Vista Avenue big news is coming on Tuesday with nobody

684
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
That day that Tuesday

685
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,824
What causes yellow

686
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
EXO

687
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
I think there's a thing when there's a pattern

688
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
I think we're

689
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
He has been going to cause a lot more lately

690
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
Red is definitely true there's a tree

691
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Towards more calls

692
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,208
But I think whenever the show is almost all calls

693
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
It's because I don't want to f*** around I want to do it

694
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
Yeah I said I was going to

695
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
Cut a chip out of somebody

696
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
Let's pretend I didn't

697
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
Yep just talked to the people

698
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Subject calls in

699
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
It's like Judah

700
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
It's a little bit like

701
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:20,640
Hey they think that I'm going to get this but you know what else they'll really love being able to talk to me

702
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,944
Write themselves

703
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
These callers

704
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Jackalope

705
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeah so Jeff

706
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
From Canada gets on

707
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
He has an interesting

708
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
Sing idea

709
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
For how

710
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
I going to win the battle

711
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
I do not a f****** doing caterpillar

712
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
Here's what I was thinking

713
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,032
What would it look like if Trump would look out into one of his rallies

714
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Elisa Hunter

715
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,384
Thousands of people with duct tape on their mouth

716
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Sensor for

717
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,016
What looking at Infowars I was censured for

718
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
Target

719
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,600
Maxine's power sensor for whatever

720
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,184
What I'm seeing and I also met this deal.

721
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,976
Just an idea

722
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,840
What about the the armored vehicle showing up at a trump rally early

723
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
The big lines are out

724
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
And gold handle

725
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Duct tape

726
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
Talk to people about

727
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
Essential

728
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,824
Free speech is going

729
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
Do a silent protest

730
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Trump rally

731
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,296
People putting duct tape over their mouths would you like to fly to Austin

732
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Meijer

733
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
300 days

734
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Operation

735
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
Actually

736
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,816
Giving this guy a job love it

737
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:49,216
Couple problems with this truck would never be able to read the word words that are written on duct tape on some

738
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,776
Someone's mouth I was thinking that maybe he meant maybe

739
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
He didn't specifically say written on their mouth

740
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,224
How did he maybe you meant the application

741
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Second

742
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Give a f***

743
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
Although it would be

744
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Really f***** up as a visual

745
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
Brother mouth

746
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:20,448
Because I knew I think in this scenario none of these people will be able to stop themselves from also class

747
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,288
And yelling with their bowels duct tape

748
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,272
Excuse me I can't I can't hear you you guys your guys

749
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,576
You guys need to take the duct tape off your mouth

750
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,136
So Alex Rambles for about 10 minutes

751
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
About why this is the greatest idea

752
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
And why you going to steal it

753
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
Knockout this guy's not getting

754
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,584
But Alex is going to steal the idea

755
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
Like I said there's a

756
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
The couple Bravo

757
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
The first is a truck couldn't see the letters now

758
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
The 2nd

759
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Duct tape

760
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
How the f*** are we going to monetize that

761
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
We're going to put number out today

762
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,688
Go to the hotline bling 1000 calls have to go through all the other calls but

763
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,040
Send email to show tips infowars.com

764
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
I pledged 100 stickers

765
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
1000 stickers

766
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
We'll just pay whatever it takes

767
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
You know what I just believe you

768
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,816
Whoever goes to show temps infowars.com

769
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
Address

770
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
Will call for those will send you those

771
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
I'll man the damn thing myself

772
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Destiny

773
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,176
Bill passed us and we need to go take over those compliments

774
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,272
Conservative

775
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Remove

776
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Neocon never trumper's be removed

777
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,208
Elected be defended by their president

778
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,792
Is a serious solution

779
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824
Dot-com hey there

780
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,224
Debate about all of that couple problems

781
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
How you going to yell infowars.com if you got duct tape on your mouth I believe they have stickers on their the bumper sticker

782
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,048
Get a little bit of juice out of that

783
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,864
Yeah this is really stupid

784
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,936
But it is a good way to possibly create an absurd spect

785
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
I was out I figured

786
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Once

787
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,848
It's probably funny in a movie in the real world I think would be a really scary

788
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
Directions to yell

789
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,856
That does sound like the beginning of a

790
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
It would be funny the first time I think it would be hilarious

791
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
The second and third time not funny

792
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,072
Before Time very scary fifth time

793
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
Hilarious again it's The Simpsons rake effect

794
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,936
Silent Bob in reality

795
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
You might end up seeing is like

796
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:09,152
Two people with bumper stickers on their mouths of the Trump rally and don't want to understand what's going on except us and then

797
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,784
I'll be drowned out by everybody with their cute t-shirts

798
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
Weird thing about where he's at now

799
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Is

800
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
I personally would not want

801
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
2

802
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
Do those public call to

803
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,376
Just because now I don't think his audience is anywhere near

804
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
The level that it was before

805
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,752
So you don't want to find out exactly how small your audience

806
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
And those calls-to-action

807
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
In the past have often been things

808
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
That have been

809
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,944
Potentially financially advantageous

810
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,808
So someone who's not even a fan might want to go and yell Bill Clinton's a rapist

811
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
Jiraiya to try and get $1,000

812
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:55,488
Yeah so you could see how anybody might be inclined to do that even if they're not

813
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
Onboard

814
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
And not yet you wouldn't want a public

815
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
Demonstration of how we

816
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
Weak your s***

817
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,704
But the bumper stickers on the map

818
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Let's do it

819
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
So

820
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Could this Jeffy

821
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
In Canada

822
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Compliments Alex

823
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
After Alex Rambles but I was going to take his ideas

824
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
And then Alex

825
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Gets mad at him

826
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
I'm forgetting comp

827
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,320
I can kind of relate to I sometimes push back when someone compliments me

828
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
But Alex Goes little bit too far

829
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
You know I think there is

830
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,376
A truth that you guys are the tip of the spear you guys are the best and that's just the way it is your insurance

831
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,168
You just gave the order

832
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,984
Central Texas

833
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Disinformation hub

834
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
You had the idea

835
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,384
Most the time it's you I was driving around in 2015

836
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
Homemade sign

837
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
Yard

838
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,528
Hillary for prison

839
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:56,160
2016 and I went with that idea and it was a third of the shirts at the RNC

840
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,768
You understand that the orders come from you that's why

841
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Always want to hear what

842
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:06,400
Supporters and always getting notes and demanding the Secret Service get all the stuff

843
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,592
You loyal

844
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
Come from you comes from us

845
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,968
Don't you get it I steal ideas

846
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,808
Has revealed that he has no ideas of his own and he just

847
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Trolls around

848
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,720
Stealing individual's ideas and not giving them any credit for it I am the tip of the spear only because

849
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Steal from you

850
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,352
You you are great do you not realize

851
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
All I do

852
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,704
Do now is talk about mediums and try to jump on their back

853
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,824
And I try and get whatever traction I can out of fly-by-night people who

854
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,640
Make a f****** video with their dog

855
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
Zika Highland

856
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
Count dankula

857
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,552
The guy who hit things of hammers are they

858
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
30 year old who got kicked out of his parents

859
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
Basement I just try and

860
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,440
Attach myself to whatever dumb

861
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,280
Bulshit is flying around in the right-wing media sphere

862
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,352
I was saying Mike Tyson

863
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,424
And then I steal things and make money off it

864
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Jeff

865
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,568
That's not a successful business model Jeff

866
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Don't don't join Infowars

867
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
You should stay in Canada

868
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:25,504
So Alex freaks out two more about this and I would say that this is pretty unhinged

869
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
And I do not know why Alex

870
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Please respond

871
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
Nothing like this to Jeff

872
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,904
Trying to be nice

873
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
It's very

874
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
Text is his backlash

875
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
You're getting the orders here

876
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
Praise God for us

877
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,151
How big it is

878
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
Feel important you are

879
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,647
DeFazio really quick

880
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
One thing I think it's really in

881
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,487
First thing I think he's doing there is being like

882
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
We're going to do this

883
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
And you're going to let

884
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Jeff.

885
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,143
If you don't go along with this big idea

886
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
It's not so much me

887
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,215
It's not Trump it's not the West

888
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
You're letting Jeff

889
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,311
You're going to let Jeff

890
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,151
From Canada Downs weird sort of Shifting of guilty

891
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Just for me now

892
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Very strange

893
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,223
If you can afford the plane to

894
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:47,679
Viewers I am online now

895
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:02,527
I don't want to sit here and watch as overrun by these zombies and their controllers

896
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
I know you are supposed to be

897
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
You're the tip of the spear

898
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
Femi for the inspector personality

899
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
They said John

900
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Little out of breath

901
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Something

902
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,335
Because I was waiting for you inspector

903
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Wait for you

904
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
What else should we do Jeff

905
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Jeff Jeff

906
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:40,671
God damn what you all when you saw only one set of footprints in the sand it was you okay

907
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,511
Gary Young

908
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,583
I remember back when I was in drama class

909
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,143
When I was in like a Maybe Junior High or so

910
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
Aaron's

911
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
Skit and I was a little overboard with the

912
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
Jim Carrey dead

913
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
You know

914
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,575
You only went over well. Nice reaction from the audience that but

915
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
Afterwards we're getting notes

916
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
The teacher the teacher said

917
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,999
There's a difference between acting and overact

918
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,583
That's a lesson that I would like to bring

919
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,143
From my youth to the present date

920
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
Discuss what Alex just did

921
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
It reminded me

922
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
Nothing so much of

923
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,055
Joe Pesci asking like

924
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847

943
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,719
So I was goes to break and he comes back there's a longer clip

944
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
This might be like a form

945
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,327
At some point but what happens if

946
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655

I like it

951
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,503
What I think is particularly

952
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
Important about this is like

953
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831

Anymore really well

956
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183

He even enjoy

958
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,487

959
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Dramatically about b*******

960
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,631

Direct Eggman declaring independence

Paradise oil

985
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,415

Ancestor

Just real quick Alex

988
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,911
Not for nothing Alex is kind of rambling about blood and soil

989
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,239
I wasn't stoked about that but I'm trying to focus on the song

990
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:48,639
Night

991
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,039

Renegade in the world today

994
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:18,079

Put-in-Bay

999
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:00,575
We won't even live to see the things our sacrifices buying

1000
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:06,975
The enemy has not even begun for suspect

1001
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,375
The resources that they paid forward

1002
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:18,239
Spiritual Dimension underground aquifer

1003
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,615
And the enemies of God do not have

1004
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,383
Birthright

1005
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,199
Yesterday

00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
Nothing much

1007
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
God will finally make them pure

1008
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
When all they do is produce death

1009
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
And sickness

1010
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
Buena state

1011
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
From the foundations

1012
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,815
Airmaster

1013
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,887
They are all their father the devil

1014
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,703
Supergirl for the Renegade

1015
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,031
Can save them because they have chosen

1016
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,311
To follow

1017
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
Father

1018
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
The devil

1019
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
No more pretty original rent

00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,783
Call Josh.

1021
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Okay

1022
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,463
But you could see all the ants

1023
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
2020

1024
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,327
Could feel

1025
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,191
Freeport hours

1026
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,031
And the fear that anyone fears

1027
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:29,663
The devil has Peter should not be

1028
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
Find yourself

1029
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:36,831
Of the show

1030
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,415
Isn't a tire commercial to commercial

1031
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
Singing along yelling

1032
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,999
Nonsense over the Renegades

1033
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:49,119
Then getting into preaching about his enemies are damn that yelling at himself about how he's

1034
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,935
Got to stop preaching and get two calls and then get to the news

1035
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,215
Itza

1036
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,751
This is this show is

1037
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Just

1038
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
How to control not be

1039
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
More

1040
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
I could have

1041
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,455
I could have the whole thing was

1042
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,087
Fell apart for me because what should have happened is the drum fill from I can feel it coming in the air tonight

1043
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
And then we could have f******

1044
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,439
Nail this whole thing

1045
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,511
Amazing this would have been the perfect segment

1046
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
If they attended with that drum fill

1047
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Or just something quirky

1048
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,399
Do you like Easy Lover by Phil Collins

1049
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,983
Something else like a jaunty like

1050
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,823

Knuckle down absolutely

1056
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,327
So he that we just heard him go out to commercial

1058
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375

Really we're doing this again

1062
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Empire

1063
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:18,463
Fire by our creator

1064
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,863
Never

1065
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:37,663
Only summon their destruction

1066
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:50,463
Will directed all the great man with sturdy little will be torn down

1067
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,607
Will beg for redemption in the end but it will fall on deaf ears

1068
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,447
Are your phone calls I'm going to head back down the railing I said but

1069
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:05,567
Not quite yet here on this final transmission of

1070
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,151

1071
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:15,295
New York

1072
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,879
You're on the air welcome Jeff from Canada

1073
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671

1074
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,767
You know you could turn down the music.

1075
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:30,655
Everybody there is like it's New Year's Eve let's get the f*** out of here let's see

1076
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:36,031
Some songs have the stronger suspicion that Alex is in a bad mood and he just needs pump up Jam

1077
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
Yeah like I can't even get into this

1078
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
F****** play some

00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,431
Like really inspiring music and I'll fake

1080
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Fake it

1081
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,807
A new form of preaching where the

1082
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,159
Instead of bothering with reading the Bible and learning in

1083
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Providing wisdom

1084
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
You just play f******

1085
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,231
Classic rock

1086
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,023
Can talk to it as if it's talking back

1087
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
Amanda work

1088
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,839
I think that'd be great

1089
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
So liberal calls in

1090
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Liberal

1091
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,983
And so what liberals got to say

1092
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,287
Is Martin

1093
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,919
Everyone enjoys the Patriot Rock

1094
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
Liberal asks

1095
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Along the lines of

1096
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,295
How are we

1097
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
Tending

1098
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:24,415
Trump is doing a good job and is anything other than what we

1099
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,695
Been accustomed to

1100
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,463
When

1101
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,767
He re-signed the Patriot Act

1102
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
Yuri sign the ndaa

1103
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
What

1104
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,679
What when are you going to recognize these things

1105
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
And call it out for what it is right

1106
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
And Alex

1107
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Is not

1108
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,335
Doing a good job

1109
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:46,431
With this call disciplined broadcast

1110
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:51,807
This is what I'm speaking with regards to Trump why is it that he's renewing The Patriot

1111
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,391
Being great again

1112
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,975
We Revere the Constitution and our freedoms of

1113
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,023
Speech and things of that nature

1114
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
Why is it is Tyrion

1115
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
Can you explain that to me

1116
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,263
Totally agree with you let me finish this piece of chicken

1117
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,567
You talk

1118
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
Well

1119
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,967
Looks like our theory is confirm

1120
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,183
Check that out check that box off of the United States

1121
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
Even when other people are talking

1122
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,791
Pretty regularly on air

1123
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,887
Cannibalism earlier because I feel like that would also check it out

1124
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Metabolism

1125
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
And it's some form or another

1126
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:47,103
Hey man I won't answer your question about why Trump is good but he renewed The Patriot Act but I got this chicken in my mouth

1127
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,967
Is brass that I got in the mouth

1128
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,527
And then I got a great answer for you

1129
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
It is not a book

1130
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
That's not surprised

1131
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,439
Know this color is pretty good but it's it's a bit long

1132
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,743
Really tough to dissect

1133
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,279
The pieces where

1134
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,095
It's ultimately unfulfilling it's on gratify

1135
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,167
Because the answer those questions as he can

1136
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,447
And so he won't

1137
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,495
And you're not going to get the answer you want

1138
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,079
Him saying he can't and Alex's never going to address

1139
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,895
Never going to give a

1140
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
A solid answer

1141
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,967
Liberal is talking

1142
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
Trump should do

1143
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,575
And the answer is basically

1144
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
Take the money

1145
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:35,999
It's being spent on these overseas Wars and them reallocate them for infrastructure project job creation

1146
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
Some pretty

1147
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,167
Write redistribution all rains of what stupid liberal to say those things

1148
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:46,751
That is a pretty little that's a position that you'd hear on the left

1149
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,079
I think a lot of people on the right my

1150
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,919
Be like let's just stop spending the money whereas on the left

1151
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
A lot of people are more towards

1152
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,015
Putting that money towards things

1153
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,063
That will create greater outcomes

1154
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,855
For people who are in

1155
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,415
Bad financial

1156
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:08,255
And reinvestment in the country itself public spaces yes

1157
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,791
That that sort of s***

1158
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,351
So it's really interesting

1159
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,143
To hear Alex's response

1160
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:17,471
To Liberal saying that that is what that should Trump

1161
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Subdue

1162
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,799
Because I've totally agrees with him

1163
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:26,431
Counter to every libertarian nonsense

1164
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
Then things get ugly

1165
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,807
And the call ends exactly how most of these calls

1166
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,879
You done your research what is in 30 seconds

1167
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Omnisd

1168
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
Creative

1169
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Shadow whatever

1170
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,119
Explain to the country that busy League Awards

1171
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,679
Pulling these troops out now

1172
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,495
You have given them couple with respect to the actions of

1173
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,287
Subordinate

1174
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,847
If that is the case I like you

1175
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
Call Tim

1176
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,431
Call the troops out

1177
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
You agree

1178
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,015
Sign or relocate the money that you bought

1179
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
Twisties

1180
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,903
Rebuilding infrastructure in United States created drug programs

1181
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:12,255
This is what people need totally agree totally agree with you

1182
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
And look

1183
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,351
He said take Brennan security clearance date didn't do it

1184
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,911
You said leave Afghanistan

1185
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,847
What does he do when he's around it

1186
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
Koala Kids one

1187
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,431
When Obama was in power

1188
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
It's the same Reese

1189
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
Singani legally under him will be at

1190
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,743
She has to take the reins now Ali

1191
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:50,655
2020 RV dealers

1192
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
No Alex

1193
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,007
The part of the

1194
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,847
Journey still going on

1195
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:07,807
Great point about get his number and info

1196
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,135
All the news I said I would want your calls

1197
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
Powerful cars

1198
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,743
Guide job

1199
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
That's all I

1200
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:20,095
All I hear is I need you guys to continue talking so I can

1201
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,423
Finish my music

1202
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,471
So that call didn't go

1203
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239
Well

1204
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,543
I don't think because I think liberal was making

1205
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
Decent points

1206
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,383
Didn't have anywhere really to go with

1207
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Because

1208
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
They are

1209
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,967
Points that are real problem

1210
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
Alex

1211
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,015
He spent

1212
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
Years

1213
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,343
Yelling about the Patriot Act in the ndaa

1214
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,391
Write and do very idea

1215
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
That Trump would

1216
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Get rid of them

1217
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,023
Is really counter to Alex's

1218
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
Narratives

1219
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,375
About what Trump believes what he would do what he will do

1220
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,655
Into

1221
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
Best not to talk about

1222
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:01,823
Oh yeah you don't want to you don't want to worry about it whether or not the guy you said was going to do all this stuff is actually doing it because

1223
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,871
You can't say that

1224
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
So Alex

1225
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
Comes back

1226
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
From break and you know what

1227
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:12,831
Going to do

1228
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,671
Oh yes you can

1229
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,463
Got to be honest

1230
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,999
I'm liking it

1231
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,095
This is a good New Year's Eve note

1232
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:43,295
Beating transmission

1233
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:47,391
Proven to be transmitting

1234
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,791
Applied Anna hummingbird from Canada down to South America

1235
01:01:54,047 --> 01:02:00,191
Magnetic

1236
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,263
Universe

1237
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,823
Belong to Satan we belong to God

1238
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,663
Nailed it

1239
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:13,503
Straight at the Provo

1240
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,599
People are scared.

1241
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,439
Pretty awesome

1242
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,719
Lino

1243
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,815
Everything looks right through yourself

1244
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,351
Down to the tiny items

1245
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
Free will

1246
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,319
The powerful.

1247
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
See your old man

1248
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,975
Get out of bed

1249
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
Landon

1250
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Stronger

1251
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
Embryo

1252
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,863
Does he know who it is yet

1253
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,191
How tall is this

1254
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
So it is

1255
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,103
Powerful words

1256
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
Powerball

1257
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,343
I really think this is my favorite show the year so far just so you know I think you belong to the city

1258
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,903
He must have just gone into public domain or being

1259
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
Like whatever

1260
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:32,095
Lease agreement he has with songs to a record label and a bunch lately

1261
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,887
Are you listening

1262
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,191
Are you listening to that text and it might

1263
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,751
Taking over like Quarterflash

1264
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,359
My number one spot of sacks

1265
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:48,479
How you could that mean hard my heart's pretty great there's no stopping

1266
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,807
CIA

1267
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
It's good news

1268
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
That

1269
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,903
The devil is old

1270
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,183
But not I'm depressed

1271
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,975
That means you can run away from it

1272
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,047
Setting the other is not omnipresent

1273
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,375
I hope

1274
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
I don't know

1275
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,239
If the devil isn't omnipresent

1276
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
I guess I never really thought about it

1277
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,359
I mean I never thought of

1278
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
You know what that's good boy

1279
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
That's a good boy

1280
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,271
If that's

1281
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:27,647
The case then there have to be places where you could go to get away from The Temptations or whatever you know like

1282
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,695
Don't have to be a thing

1283
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,535
Right here is here's what I'm going to say is what I think

1284
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
He thinks

1285
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,351
Crying terms of omnipresence

1286
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
I believe he thinks

1287
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:43,775
God is everywhere simultaneously all around us and within us but isn't that where is that

1288
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
Can go anywhere

1289
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,639
But he's not always everywhere

1290
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:54,527
So if the devil is tempting me he can't send me temperature

1291
01:04:54,783 --> 01:05:00,927
That's a very inefficient

1292
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,231
What you mean based on what you're saying

1293
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,279
I think that's what he believed

1294
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:11,679
I'm not really sure what I've ever considered I guess I always thought it was kind of more of a metaphor

1295
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,495
Never considered

1296
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
Logistics

1297
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,103
Physical properties or attributes

1298
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,711
Giving him mutant powers can he can he multiply can there be a million devils

1299
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
And he can send

1300
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,271
All of them to eat

1301
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,807
Individual place today

1302
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,599
To have that could be us

1303
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Subordinate

1304
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
You know

1305
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,439
What's what's the infrastructure

1306
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:38,559
What's an opening salary for the devil I will say that I agree with Alex at least

1307
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
Conception of the devil that he is

1308
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,631
So

1309
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:45,215
That is where we can find common ground

1310
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
Can you agree on Howell

1311
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
Pretty old

1312
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,103
So it does make clip

1313
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
It's kind of old

1314
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
At this point but Alex is just as old as the devil

1315
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Not that

1316
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:01,343
He's constantly displaying these pump up Jam

1317
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
Is not going to go over babe

1318
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:07,999
I do you enjoy research and almost nothing to look into

1319
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
So here you eat pumpkin

1320
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,863
Some more and then he's like

1321
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,911
We're getting to the end of the sea

1322
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,471
S h a b l e

1323
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:23,103
And I think he has to rationalize why he hasn't gotten into the news yet

1324
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,503
IQ

1325
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:35,903
Now I'm going to do it I'm not getting the Iran News

1326
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,743
Socratic

1327
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
Gary

1328
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,615
I could totally do it I got a hundred percent doing I'm totally ready I've prepared everything

1329
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,175
I can't do it until I take the 15 calls

1330
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,015
We are at the end of our 2 and he's taken 3

1331
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,647
I do not believe you will get to that 15 I cannot stress enough

1332
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:13,791
That the only reason I am singing along and talking to all of these songs for what amounts to

1333
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:18,399
A half hour at least at this point is because I'm actually too prepared

1334
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
To talk about Iran and Iraq

1335
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:23,519
Who prepared guys holy

1336
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:29,407
How it does say that sometimes like I'm 24 Paradise information

1337
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,735
Nobody

1338
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Forcing him

1339
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:38,623
These calls we do for years he's just said he's going to go to Carl's and then never does

1340
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,207
For that but now for some reason there's an arbitrary

1341
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,303
Rule that you must take these receiving calls before he gets to the news

1342
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
It's it look

1343
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
There's pressure from the higher-ups

1344
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
Eric Church

1345
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,935
Suspicious

1346
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
I have a question

1347
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,567
And this is a hypothetical I know you can actually enter this on

1348
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,103
But I like to imagine

1349
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
That

1350
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
This is his production

1351
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,991
Instead of knowing that he's got a little button

1352
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,319
That they can press where it's like we just play this song for 4 minutes

1353
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,855
That's four minutes ahead of talkative

1354
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,159
The song we don't need it there's no previous

1355
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:12,927
Discussion

1356
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
He doesn't

1357
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,255
Bad and I

1358
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:22,143
Hey Google

1359
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,959
It's an interesting Theory it's possible but

1360
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Obviously

1361
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Approval

1362
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:32,127
I think it's more Alex is yelling at them during the breaks you play these goddamn Jam

1363
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,455
I could go either way I'm running on fumes really good

1364
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,479
I need some

1365
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,111
Silex says start to take

1366
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,903
More calls

1367
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,927
Some guy and

1368
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,487
He just gets off on a riff about how

1369
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,047
You know what the drag queen story times

1370
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Some stuff they're going to have their Satan

1371
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,631
Demons and they're going to come take your kids share

1372
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,703
It's a weary start in media res

1373
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,727
If one of those ran

1374
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
Towing you

1375
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
More thing Alex

1376
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:16,671
Obviously we're in a retriever

1377
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:41,503
Mimics and counterfeit something's you don't think God's people have a rage 1000 times more powerful than them

1378
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,575
We can take out 100 of their best people one-man Focus

1379
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,487
So we're obviously

1380
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:58,143
We got a short time of reprieve right here with President truck to get right with with God and Jehovah

1381
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,287
And whatever your name for God as this is our short time or reprieve

1382
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,335
What is my name for God is Allah

1383
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,871
What happens

1384
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,919
President-trump

1385
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
It's gone

1386
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,551
What what goes on from

1387
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,111
From there

1388
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:22,719
Question God bless you are incredible caller

1389
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:27,071
Lenny says that he's going to answer when he comes back from break because I think this is

1390
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,143
40 Chicana certain level I don't think he wants a direct question

1391
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
Except for right up again

1392
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,471
Hamster break

1393
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:39,871
Justin Case

1394
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,711
I mean was all good well with

1395
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,991
Canadian guy with the duct

1396
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
I don't

1397
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,087
He doesn't want to do that

1398
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,111
Not so

1399
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,415
I think there's a strategy to the ranting

1400
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,975
In order to delay this question until you can look at the

1401
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:59,583
The clock and see like yeah okay there's 40 seconds left till break let him get the question out

1402
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
I can come back

1403
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,423
What do we do after Trump great

1404
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
Yeah that's

1405
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:08,799
That he doesn't really answer

1406
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
This is

1407
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,919
That's that's a bad job

1408
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,711
The director be like okay

1409
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,783
Do do more or less because you suck at this

1410
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Let's go character

1411
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Yeah

1412
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,111
It's uninspired

1413
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,903
It's transparent

1414
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
Lion

1415
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,327
So if he goes to break and comes back in his answer is largely this

1416
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,375
Same sort of mealy-mouthed

1417
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,423
Thing but he's been doing for a while

1418
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,239
Is the you like we put Trump in focus on

1419
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,519
What are movement

1420
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,799
It is not Trump as a

1421
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
The person

1422
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,127
That's all you've been doing for years as folks

1423
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,407
As a person

1424
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
Do whatever

1425
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,527
He's trying to pretend that didn't happen everybody has the right to live

1426
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,343
Sterilized whatever

1427
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
I'm not going to I'm not going to dance

1428
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
It's too hard on

1429
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
On on that one

1430
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,559
The time my high school English teacher called life lie

1431
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,911
And he said it was the most dangerous thing to interfere with

1432
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:11,007
To the point where he said he told his dad off once when he was like

1433
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,311
And is that just punched him in

1434
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
Take them out of the house

1435
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,639
That's his idea

1436
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Interrupting

1437
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
Sleepwalking

1438
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
With the saxophone

1439
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,039
IHOP

1440
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,575
So Alex

1441
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,343
Gets another call

1442
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Call from a guy

1443
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,415
And we've talked about this a little bit in the past

1444
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,487
Like you suggested sometimes when people call in to do

1445
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,559
Egregious sales pitches yeah they're fake call

1446
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,607
I don't think that's necessarily what if

1447
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,655
Fake call on Alex's show would look like

1448
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:42,239
Sure because I think the audience is trained up well enough to know

1449
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
That

1450
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,799
Did you plug the product you get 22

1451
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
This is a good way we

1452
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,127
Scratch each other's backs that's worth

1453
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,943
It's sort of a formality with callers on his

1454
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,247
I never really sets off red

1455
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Flags for me

1456
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,319
This call I don't I'm not

1457
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,367
I think that this is fake

1458
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,183
Super well could be real it could be someone

1459
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,719
Coming up with

1460
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,023
Fun way to talk to Alex Shore

1461
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,327
But I am saying that if there is

1462
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
Afaik

1463
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,167
Kind of call on Alex's show like a plan

1464
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,191
It would be like that

1465
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,055
What the color

1466
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
Ehlers-danlos

1467
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:23,967
Infowars is totally on it in there until I just recently got out of the military

1468
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,039
This part of the Special Operations community

1469
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:31,647
And red black we were getting ready to invade North Korea

1470
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:36,511
You were right on with your timelines I was listening to you the entire

1471
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,815
Your time and I was just blown away that

1472
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,631
I don't know where you were getting your Intel from but

1473
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:46,239
But I was listening to you it was like I was hearing and I was hearing

1474
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:49,567
Other information privileged information that I thought was

1475
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,359
No.

1476
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,407
Secret but somehow you got it out

1477
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,199
Anyway

1478
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
Surprise me

1479
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
It's all these different

1480
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,831
International entities are

1481
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:05,183
Or listening to you constantly for what's going on in the world

1482
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,023
That is worth far more than any money 2 hours

1483
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Does he have the appearance

1484
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,375
To somebody who has high-level clearances Saginaw

1485
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,935
This information is exactly the sort of thing you hear

1486
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,055
I could also see that not being a setup

1487
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:26,943
And it being a caller who is Listen to Too Much Alex and misinterpreted things they experienced in the service

1488
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,735
Or it could be

1489
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
Temperature

1490
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,319
Shut up I don't buy there's a girlfriend

1491
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,623
Yeah but there's a number possibilities but

1492
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,183
If I were to bet on

1493
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,975
Something being

1494
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
What Alex

1495
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Would want

1496
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
Ucreate

1497
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
That would be a

1498
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
Yeah yeah cuz it creates the

1499
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Credibility

1500
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,911
I'm the like

1501
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,751
High-level heads-of-state listen to my show

1502
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,311
Did Alex's desperate

1503
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
Cultivate

1504
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
But it's

1505
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Complete

1506
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,431
And now is a good time for it

1507
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,711
Karaoke

1508
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,015
Why wouldn't be listening to him

1509
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,903
Don't worry.

1510
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,183
That are like

1511
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,463
Former Special Ops

1512
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,767
Or he can credibly

1513
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,559
Read let me

1514
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Start that over

1515
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,863
At this point in time

1516
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
He can't

1517
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,911
Get any guest

1518
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,471
Credibly say that they're special

1519
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Not

1520
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,847
I think that Bracken I don't know what he was in but I believe he wasn't list

1521
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
He was in the service

1522
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,663
He wasn't listed but he was

1523
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
I don't know yet right

1524
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,735
Mikey was Branch une

1525
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,783
Nothing but if you wasn't in the service

1526
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
He's

1527
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,391
Everything about his character implies

1528
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
Disability

1529
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
So I don't

1530
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
I don't know

1531
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,423
Going over the roster in my head and I don't think so no I don't I don't believe so and you can only be told that you are

1532
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,263
Listen to by the leaders of the World by Steve pieczenik so many times

1533
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,287
Before you start thinking

1534
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Steve

1535
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:58,847
You're lying

1536
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,199
You dumbass all because it comes packaged with so many other bowls

1537
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,295
So you going to call her there's no bad he's Spec Ops

1538
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:13,695
Holyshit we were going to invade North Korea a thing that many special ops people would absolutely say

1539
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,231
Upon leaving the military

1540
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
You know how they do

1541
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,095
To be clear I'm not saying that was a fake caller any

1542
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
But that genre

1543
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,423
Yes what Alex would create

1544
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,263
I believe based on his personality based on the needs of the show

1545
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
Cuz that

1546
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,567
What that does

1547
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,615
That establishes this dislike

1548
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:35,199
High-level credibility with the people who were listening to already on the hook

1549
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,735
Maybe people who are

1550
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
Almost on the hook

1551
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,831
It gets them deeper into it like all this guy is

1552
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,903
Did Alex's shoot is credible I don't know I'm not

1553
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
Special Ops

1554
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,767
This guy it serves his purposes really really well

1555
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,607
That's pretty good call for Alex but that one in the Wind

1556
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,375
That was good

1557
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
So Alex still has not gotten to

1558
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:02,847
Promise to give you mine you on the situation will be able to bring attack such a big deal with my

1559
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:09,759
Grabbing man on the position of all flags and now I know they're going to head up to the bar to get us that way in there now

1560
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,807
Moaning out the message

1561
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,631
That one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 collars online

1562
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,703
I'll try to get all of those

1563
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,007
At least you're on the line I will tell

1564
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,823
Covering those those topics during the fourth hour

1565
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,151
Thank you all for joining us please don't forget

1566
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,015
The biggest sales of our history are going on right now

1567
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,319
And when these are over we'll never have them this big

1568
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
So

1569
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,391
Being lazy at

1570
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:51,487
He's in the fourth hour Alex is hosting the fourth hour himself

1571
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,535
And he's in the fourth hour here now

1572
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,815
And what he's doing

1573
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Is saying

1574
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:01,215
Halfway through the fourth hour I'll get to the news but in this half hour I'm going to take time

1575
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
10 calls

1576
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,055
None of this is going to happen

1577
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,615
Know you know that none discipline show

1578
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,383
10 calls

1579
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Half hour

1580
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:09,919
Bang about

1581
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,199
They're couple questions

1582
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,479
You can't be that complicated

1583
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:18,879
Not noticed that there's a bit of a jump there like at the end of the second hour and then now we're already at the store sour

1584
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,903
The third hours

1585
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,183
The disaster is it

1586
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,975

Roll the dice

Madeline

01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,976
This is the same place to buy chicken

1628
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,024
Massing troops in that region

1629
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,584
Why are you here now

1630
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,376
Critical mass

1631
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,656
Looking for Annex

1632
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,192
Used to go in and hit a run

1633
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,776
Kushner is there linked to Israel I mean come on man

1634
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:48,384
Oh it's okay for Iran to overrun and attack our Embassy

1635
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,200
Go ahead and repeat mainstream media.

1636
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
Rocky Point

1637
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:58,624
Exactly what to say

1638
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,672
See how Alex pivots there oh yeah

1639
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,720
Not going to deal with Bolton

1640
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
Going to talk about whether or not you're faking the

1641
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:12,704
Call the video

1642
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,776
Get to being as I got was a fake video out at the embassy

1643
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,592
That's so sneaky and so lame

1644
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:22,944
The color doesn't really fall for it but he can't really make much Headway without

1645
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,968
Alex isn't willing

1646
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,504
Engaged

1647
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,272
Things that are being

1648
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
Brought up

1649
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,832
So he Rambles a bit

1650
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,392
He says this

1651
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,464
He's trying to explain that he's not for offensive Wars

1652
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,536
Kind of makes a

1653
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,584
Location for attacking garage

1654
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Okay well yeah

1655
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Tell me Jeremy

1656
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,240
Now you saying

1657
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
Music

1658
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,664
Starting offensive

1659
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,272
Fish

1660
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:04,160
It's okay you're not for offensive

1661
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,720
You think it's appropriate to start a war

1662
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
Because Aaron

1663
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,304
Is running around acting like the boss of the Middle East

1664
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
Yes these are in congruous

1665
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:18,752
Positions to have it's not an offensive War if somebody looks like a bully and you don't understand what or why they're do

1666
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,776
And then you just

1667
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
Super 8

1668
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,920
I do think that Alex is position makes no sense

1669
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Yes I agree

1670
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
Okay

1671
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,832
J.p. licks

1672
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:38,464
So Alex wanted is Jeremy that scholar was brought up that he sounds a lot like John Bolton

1673
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,816
Yeah hang on hang on I'll let you

1674
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:49,728
And I got to quickly remove a computer chip from this homeless guy though I will get right back to you

1675
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,800
For the past three weeks on hold for a little bit

1676
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,080
Cuz he's got to ramble about

1677
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,872
How this is not

1678
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,200
The beginning of the decade

1679
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,480
How to go live

1680
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Infowars

1681
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,808
Dot-com live feed

1682
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,136
Everybody cuz it is a big deal 2020 it's not

1683
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,720
Starting but

1684
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:15,328
If This Is War on knowledge the war on calendars it's an obsession

1685
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,120
The war on Commodores

1686
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:21,472
Jacobin Illuminati Jacobins want you to think that it's the beginning of the decade

1687
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,776
They have been waging a war on calendars

1688
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,800
Since Gregory

1689
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,848
That is such a crucial plank

1690
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
In there

1691
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,640
Attack

1692
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,920
Making people

1693
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,992
Say it's the decade

1694
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,112
It was the night

1695
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:44,512
Templar who first weaponized the calendar did these are your enemies believe it

1696
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:50,144
These are your enemies people who want you to think the decade starts a year earlier

1697
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
What are you doing

1698
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,472
Fighting against

1699
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,008
Hallmark cards

1700
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,032
Chowpatty

1701
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,592
So I don't know why he gets

1702
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,152
Down this road necessarily but Alex

1703
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,944
Decides that he's going to

1704
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,712
Address the 8th

1705
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,504
Out there

1706
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,040
And I should

1707
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,088
Should say that Alex is cleared

1708
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
Okay

1709
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,136
However

1710
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,160
There's a problem

1711
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,488
Literally fighting devil worship

1712
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,864
If you're really

1713
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,472
Because you don't believe in invisible things and you really don't like being fake churches

1714
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
Other reasons

1715
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
5%

1716
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,824
Just like you

1717
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,360
I don't think you're a bad person

1718
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
Totally understand

1719
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,480
I think you're about receipts the people up above you

1720
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Teacher

1721
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,672
It's my Buffett atheist

1722
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,768
When I was 12 13 14 15 years

1723
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
Okay

1724
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,912
So freaky that would even tell my parents about it

1725
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,472
Try to get away from it

1726
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,776
Lost Boys

1727
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,080
Just like the grandpa shows up

1728
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,736
And they're not physically living forever but

1729
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,016
Virus

1730
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
Okay I think you just

1731
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,648
Watch The Lost Boys

1732
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:22,304
Hey hey atheist cuz you're turned off by churches and all that rag get it I don't think you're a bad person

1733
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:28,704
But you should know that all of your atheist gurus are vampires really bums me out to know but I'm glad

1734
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,984
That you broke the news to me

1735
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
I just don't even

1736
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,384
I don't even care like I have to research any part of that

1737
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:41,760
I did look into docking know everybody

1738
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
He's a vampire

1739
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:49,184
Sam Harris and not positive but he's not a vampire from what I can tell

1740
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,072
I do believe the Christopher Hitchens was of a

1741
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,120
I will give him

1742
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,424
This is the point where I just like

1743
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,728
I get frustrated and maybe it's

1744
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,776
Because there's too much of it elation

1745
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,824
In a single over the songs

1746
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,872
DeSoto it really is a let down

1747
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,896
Yeah it's kind of

1748
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,712
African back to that was a vampire fang

1749
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,296
Why is it whatever we're the highwomen

1750
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:20,160
Oh that is great question

1751
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,184
Because I don't want to tease beat

1752
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,256
Ono Hawaiian

1753
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,024
Crazy Tomato

1754
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,560
Even stranger no highwomen

1755
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,704
So

1756
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,264
Alex gets back to the scholar who said that he sounds

1757
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,848
He Rambles quite a bit

1758
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:42,944
About the situation in the Middle East share

1759
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
Just trying to

1760
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,248
Stop a big war

1761
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:48,064
Right so you might attack Iran in order to stop

1762
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,112
Stop a big war or something

1763
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:53,184
Not entirely sure

1764
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,464
Nicer put down

1765
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,232
Alex

1766
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,512
Is really slammed

1767
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,072
Trying to stop

1768
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,352
Giant War

1769
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,936
Are you a real threat

1770
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,496
And the globalist you're trying to stir things up in the Middle East

1771
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,824
That's my educated view on this

1772
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,872
Me is a pragmatist

1773
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,408
I just support the president

1774
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:19,808
I don't know I think the way you take the word picture you just you know

1775
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,832
Drew is

1776
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,600
Great

1777
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,880
Sounds great

1778
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,208
Problem is though is that that that isn't the

1779
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,048
It doesn't appear to be the case it appears that were actually being

1780
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,120
Alleged to be the fool that once again

1781
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,168
We're going to be sold a bill of goods

1782
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:39,776
We're now we're are striking in a rock because of a contractor

1783
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
Essentially a higher

1784
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:44,128
Blackwater guy somebody that you actually would have said.

1785
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,664
A relationship with her

1786
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,968
That you would have said you guys are

1787
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:51,552
Derek Prince

1788
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,368
Frontier Services work for the Tricom

1789
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,440
Both some of the pedophile rings

1790
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,512
Kane Brown

1791
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:05,888
You've made it sound like there's a little bit more than that no

1792
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:16,128
If you misunderstood it was an intentional misunderstanding that Alex implied contact

1793
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,968
The path really highly of him

1794
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:21,760
Especially during the early drop years

1795
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,296
He's been

1796
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
He talks about how he

1797
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
Blackwater guards

1798
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,952
Purity and stuff like that

1799
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,232
Be the change

1800
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:34,304
Whether or not you want to try and make an argument that Alex

1801
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,656
Actually has presented that he is friends with Erik Prince or not whatever

1802
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:41,984
Leave that aside

1803
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
Comparing Alex's

1804
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,848
His prior position about Blackwater in the mercenaries and stuff

1805
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,920
To where he is now on a lot of those issues

1806
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,224
Just that alone is plenty

1807
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,296
To make whatever this caller is accusing Alex of

1808
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,576
Very valid

1809
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,904
Alex has taken a very different

1810
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
Position

1811
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,464
On a lot of his stuff that he would have

1812
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:08,096
I don't care

1813
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,376
Erik Prince has a

1814
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,680
F****** Stone you wear around your neck forever

1815
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,984
There's no there's no repentance

1816
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,008
It's coming from

1817
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
Like

1818
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,312
I only like two

1819
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,872
Prince for a while is still a go f*** your

1820
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,408
You know

1821
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,200
So this call Ann

1822
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,224
After Alex

1823
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,528
Saran balls about how you didn't

1824
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,624
Claims that he has a tooth

1825
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
Pick up broke

1826
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,952
The night before until he's bleeding in his mouth

1827
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,232
Really

1828
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,256
Seems like a

1829
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:42,400
Contact that is it that is my grandma died for the 4th time this month of

1830
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,448
So Alec

1831
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,496
Still has calls to get through

1832
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,776
Still hasn't really gotten

1833
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:53,408
To the news I guess he was yelling at this guy about the situation

1834
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,432
Moving on

1835
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,224
I don't really met

1836
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
To lead the show with c

1837
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
Some big news

1838
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,552
Fourth hour

1839
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,624
Play through it no less man

1840
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,696
Jamie didn't news

1841
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:12,096
Alright I was already going to basically start broadcast

1842
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:17,472
And then we got the embassy attack by the Hezbollah Iranian

1843
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
Militia

1844
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,056
Apple prices blowing up

1845
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,200
Is planning to try to trigger a civil war here and call the United Nations into the country

1846
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:33,600
Oh really that's the big news that was the big news big news wow

1847
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,392
Holding pattern he retire

1848
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:42,048
We have accidentally teleported to anybody on Allegheny

1849
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,072
You know this one

1850
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,864
This one is the big one

1851
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,912
This was the big one and it happened

1852
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
Actually

1853
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,216
Three and a half hours

1854
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,520
It's unfortunate but he got to it a little

1855
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,848
That's a bummer so it it turns out that Tom pepper

1856
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,384
Has a come up with

1857
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,152
Some do some news

1858
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,200
The Croods

1859
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,480
Going to be getting involved

1860
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:03,040
Just to give you a rough sketch

1861
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,064
About this is

1862
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,368
Tom pappert is found a job posting

1863
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,648
On the UN website

1864
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
Right that involves

1865
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,464
Disarmament someone who's like

1866
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
Like as X

1867
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,560
Sporty's and disarmament sure no implication that it's

1868
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,328
4

1869
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
Being stationed to the United States

1870
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,936
Yeah but they've decided

1871
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,728
Did it is and the

1872
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
Used disarm denied

1873
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:28,896
Red States population are looking for a disarmament expert they're not looking for like an

1874
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,992
Academic experts with

1875
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:39,648
Some familiarity that if you have a job posting for an accounting job maybe

1876
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,208
Some years of experience

1877
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,744
Excel

1878
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,536
Sorry but he digs

1879
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:50,656
That this guy is an expert this person will be an expert in physically removing guns

1880
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,984
Pan's that's that type of disarmament

1881
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,824
Not nuclear weapon and overall

1882
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,592
Further

1883
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,384
It involves

1884
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,200
Using these things on the United States

1885
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,760
So there's a lot of assumptions being made

1886
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,808
But it's just like Tom pappert the crack

1887
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,576
The big news

1888
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,112
So now this news

1889
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,672
Which Alex is going to leave the show with but didn't

1890
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,952
I didn't even bring up in

1891
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,976
Until the 4th hour

1892
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:21,120
It's surprising that he was going to be disciplined broadcast

1893
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Imallexx

1894
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:26,496
Who decided because of this news he is now going to join Owen Shroyer on the War Room

1895
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:31,872
And keep them

1896
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,152
I don't know

1897
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,224
So in order to make that

1898
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,040
Can possibly be

1899
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,832
You realizes that he's going

1900
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:41,856
Need to get Tom

1901
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,624
Papr

1902
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,160
To be on the show

1903
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
And

1904
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,464
Why not call him on air

1905
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,512
Matt Lauer

1906
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:59,520
All this downhill have the first hour I want to call Tom pappardelle I'll just call myself but I know what I want in her

1907
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,616
Boom

1908
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,408
So I can call him

1909
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,712
This is so massive but we knew this was coming

1910
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
That whistling is

1911
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,320
Is an attack

1912
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,856
Beyond Barrett

1913
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,392
No

1914
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,672
Now that's

1915
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:23,072
You're a dog.

1916
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,608
You went

1917
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:30,752
Anyways so casual that's right time you're coming on to talk about the coming end of civilization

1918
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,544
How you doing

1919
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,336
So Alex does call Tom

1920
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,104
Course it does

1921
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,920
Hey Tom I got you live on there I wanted to make sure this happen

1922
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,992
Destroyers live would be a war room

1923
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,600
Cohoes because I was already going to make this my main show today

1924
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,136
The UN try contact

1925
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,976
Embassy situation

1926
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:53,024
And singing

1927
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,584
Can you come on with Owen

1928
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
In about 30 minutes

1929
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
Come on

1930
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,496
Absolutely Alex will be there

1931
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,640
A little bit about this massive story

1932
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,688
If it's not something we're just saying

1933
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:13,760
This is openly the UN recruiting troops for America

1934
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,904
Kicking citizens Alpha Street saying we own and control this now

1935
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:26,560
We are sovereign in the world

1936
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,864
Incredible they found a job posting

1937
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:36,288
Anyway I don't care it's a real his voice is terrible so

1938
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,312
Said what was he up

1939
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
What do you mean what was he

1940
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,664
In-depth research

1941
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,040
Used to know what kind of

1942
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:50,112
What was he doing and what kind of Demands does working

1943
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,392
For Alex have that you might

1944
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,672
Just get a call and Beyond

1945
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,464
I am here now

1946
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,000
Probably just

1947
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,048
Brainstorming dumbshit

1948
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,912
What can I make out of this

1949
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
Anyway

1950
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
Alex

1951
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:09,824
It realizes that he has about 10 minutes left.

1952
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
Of course he does

1953
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,384
And so of course

1954
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,176
Here come the excuses

1955
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,456
Okay

1956
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
But

1957
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:22,368
Everybody somebody calls

1958
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,160
37 42nd Street South

1959
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:29,024
This is exactly what I knew would lightning that was

1960
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,424
100% is exactly the clip I knew would end up appetite

1961
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:41,056
What he said at the beginning of the episode stories but I need to get through these call

1962
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,920
You're going to get to the end of the show to be like I didn't get to the news because it had always had all these calls

1963
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:49,248
It's a formula I swear to God

1964
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,808
If you told me that clip was from

1965
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,856
Any of our previous episodes

1966
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:56,928
I would believe you say stuff like that a lot

1967
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,952
That that has that has

1968
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,720
Has no time

1969
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,256
Stamp that is Evergreen

1970
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:04,864
So he lightning rounds it tries to go to a couple more calls just a bump that number up a little

1971
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
Or whatever I guess maybe there's some like

1972
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:10,240
That's being captured by the police

1973
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:13,568
So he he does that

1974
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,592
And

1975
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,616
This is how

1976
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
The show ends

1977
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,432
This is the last bit

1978
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,968
Infowars

1979
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,760
Alex Jones Show

1980
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,832
20 Mai 2019

Infowars.com live show everybody watching

1984
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,360
Message and data rates may apply

1985
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:51,200
Help seriously I'm too young for hair loss

1986
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:57,856
There isn't any music there is no Fanfare nothing it is just Alex yelling at the board Ops 2 transfer

1987
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
For the calls

1988
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,512
Over to the War Room Owen Shroyer can answer these calls that he didn't get to during his show cuz he's tried to put off

1989
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,536
Cover again

1990
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:06,816
It is

1991
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,096
This show

1992
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,400
Like the end of tour 2019

1993
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,192
This December 31st show

1994
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,216
Is almost

1995
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,520
A perfect encapsulation of how

1996
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,568
Bad

1997
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,360
How unprofessional

1998
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
Discipline

1999
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,664
Operation this is

2000
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,504
Yeah that's really disappointing there should have been a lot more pageant

2001
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,320
No but I'll tell you it it's exactly what it should

2002
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,904
If you were trying to get a spiritual sky

2003
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,184
Catch ride

2004
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,464
Alex Jones Show is

2005
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,768
The only thing that's missing really is like

2006
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,048
More racing

2007
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,584
And

2008
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,376
Probably some violent collars

2009
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,144
Sure

2010
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,424
I don't know how he man

2011
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
Undertaker

2012
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:48,544
Like as many colors as you did probably like 7 or 8 without anybody being like

2013
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:54,688
Woohoo E tuning

2014
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,480
That's good maybe they started screening

2015
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:01,856
Baby pee pee in the car waiting list for Alex B

2016
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,880
Just real quick

2017
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,928
Do you are you going to ask him about killing people

2018
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,512
The sense I get is it like there is

2019
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,560
You have a broader sample of

2020
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:15,424
Calls and there is at least a certain amount of the people who are in

2021
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,984
Inclined to call into his show that are like

2022
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,520
You're full of s*** yeah

2023
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
You are full of

2024
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,568
S*** this is nonsense

2025
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,104
Trump is not good

2026
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,920
I think that's an interesting development and into 2020

2027
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
I wonder

2028
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,736
What that'll do but

2029
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,760
You know like

2030
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,784
This guy

2031
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,064
Alex is

2032
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
Trash

2033
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:33,856
His job

2034
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,136
This is so bad

2035
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:39,232
Funny on what level to hear him sing with these songs that just

2036
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
Pump up jams

2037
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
To get him going

2038
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,584
And a couple of them like you belong to the city

2039
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,632
Straight up

2040
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
So it's that

2041
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,424
Pleasant

2042
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
On some level

2043
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:48,960
You just see it

2044
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,288
Transparent this guy

2045
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,056
Is beating like a

2046
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Sweetly

2047
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,128
Unable to cover these stories

2048
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:00,992
I've no idea where to land on any of this I haven't read anything yet so what I'm going to do

2049
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
Is put it off

2050
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
And pretend

2051
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
They are not putting it off

2052
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:10,208
When you get to the end of the show what are you going to do then I'm going to go on Owen Shroyer show and do the exact same thing

2053
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,256
It's

2054
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,024
It's predict

2055
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,048
80s

2056
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,840
It is I mean

2057
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:22,240
If there were more malicious s*** and weird murder stuff in the third hour I would say this would be a

2058
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,288
Microcosm of the

2059
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,568
The entirety of Alex's

2060
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
Career

2061
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:30,944
You know it ends not with a bang but a whimper

2062
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,272
Balding Carnival

2063
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,368
On some level I agreed to you do you want some fireworks

2064
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,416
And the herb it's almost more fitting

2065
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
Absolutely just like

2066
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:48,864
Yeah it does seem like that's how is shovel and is well if just like and we are not going to be here

2067
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,632
Tomorrow by

2068
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
It just ends with like

2069
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,960
Like a slide whistle

2070
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,776
A real sad saxophone

2071
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:08,832
Happy New Year to you all absolutely out there I hope you haven't had a good one

2072
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,368
Will be back

2073
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,648
Indeed

2074
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,672
That's true

2075
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,208
Aw cuz we're already back

2076
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,280

I will see you but until then

2078

We do have a website

2079
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144

2081

2083
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,712
At the beginning of a new deck
