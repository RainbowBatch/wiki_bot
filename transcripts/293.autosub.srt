1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan of your work

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,992
How do you feel about public displays of affection

4
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
Otherwise known as

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,112
I think that there is a scale

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,464
Reconsideration again if you're like

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
Making out hard bass grope in public

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
If you're drunk

9
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
I kind of give you a little bit of a path

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Not a 12-pack a little bit of the boundaries

11
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Taking out and getting handsy with each other in public I just that less harshly than over

12
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
Call say that

13
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,744
A little bit of a what you doing whatever

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
You get overcome by the spirit

15
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
Kissing in public

16
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,032
No big deal. It is what it is I don't know

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
I would say it's totally fine if you're going to have some light public displays of affection

18
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
Natick people judging too harshly about that

19
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
I don't know why they

20
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:36,256
The point at which it becomes like this is your personal world

21
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,840
Who use their intimate Partners pet name

22
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
Because

23
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
It's letting

24
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Something

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Private be public

26
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
It's not private

27
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:01,856
Can't be public it's that you're forcing everyone in public to engage with you in that private

28
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
I think I just I think there's something a little bit inappropriate about that

29
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
A matter of scale and if you're drunk

30
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
It's totally fine

31
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,272
Update

32
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
I figure I should go ahead and let everyone know

33
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Hi

34
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
Super hot pepper seeds

35
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
I don't understand it's growing right now

36
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,336
All the peppers that I have started a real strong

37
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,944
The peas are going real strong I've gotten a warning

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,808
Tomatoes are whiskey mistress

39
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
Overwhelming

40
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
So we may never need to cross that bridge where they are a problem

41
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,056
All the flowers I planted are doing pretty good

42
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,968
I'll let you know more developments

43
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,856
Hotly-anticipated episode

44
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
January 12th

45
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
2013 everybody let's

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
No we are doing May 2nd

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,264
And the day after Alex Jones got kicked off Instagram

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Was Watson

49
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Getting kicked off Facebook

50
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
Charlie speaking I don't like to have any knowledge of Alex

51
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,368
Alex Jones on Facebook

52
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
I think most of the presidents.

53
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
I don't know if that's

54
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
I think Alex will take it

55
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
Today's there's a lot of really sucked up

56
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,407
Stop and I actually honestly

57
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
And they could get very easily

58
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
But I totally understand

59
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,815
We started the show reading all of these articles

60
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
You guys have

61
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Right

62
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:59,007
A little added contacts could make this

63
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,335
Like I hope we'll be able to do this story and we'll get to that

64
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,039
So first

65
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
I'm a policy wonk

66
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
Next will

67
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Willow

68
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,471
Next to the poop thank you so much

69
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
I feel because if you would have been

70
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
You can only donate for so long

71
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,671
Later I thought about his body

72
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Ewok

73
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,167
Somebody donated on an elevator

74
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
You are now a technocrat

75
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
I'm a policy wonk

76
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,823
Until you're brilliant

77
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket

78
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,071
Thank you so much I like this

79
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,447
Do that but we would appreciate it

80
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,055
Like I said

81
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,895
F***** up stuff in here

82
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
Trends

83
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Disentangle

84
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,759
But before we actually get into that

85
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:51,903
Instead of an out-of-context drop

86
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
Commercial

87
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
It's because you got to enjoy the new one

88
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Okay this

89
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,423
Is one of the craziest things I've ever heard on Alec

90
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
Officials better than an example of what I'm talking about

91
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
The best a children's

92
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:51,551
Dearborn pizza made

93
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:06,911
That isn't insane commercial commercial

94
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,543
I don't know why

95
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
You're going to lose Santa Claus when he goes to bed that's insane

96
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
Talking trip balls

97
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,487
I don't know why he's trying to prove me out of the beginning of it

98
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
The burpees I don't want to know what's going on I don't know what this is a selling point

99
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
Towards the end there he says that fish oil is basically what your brain is made of

100
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
Which I had to touch with my doctor friend

101
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:08,863
Set where I pretended that I believe you

102
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,959
Doctor

103
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Let's go

104
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
Was it during operating hours

105
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:21,407
And it turns out that that is not accurate

106
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
Wrist deep in fact check

107
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
Prioritize

108
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Forever

109
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,863
Laughs about Alex's krill oil sales pitches

110
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
Favorite parts of somehow is the over-edited

111
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
Is only acceptable if it's a one take situation

112
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,063
You're getting weird but you only had a minute to shoot a commercial

113
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
50 minutes

114
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
I want

115
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
Cheraw

116
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
Forget Rock krill oil I want

117
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Shelter Dallas

118
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,567
Tape on that

119
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
Alex Alex

120
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
Tim fruge over the shaking his head in the corner

121
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,343
Barnes

122
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
Creepier creepier about the krill

123
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
Grand Mesa

124
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,911
This is our first complaint

125
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
About the Tchaikovsky

126
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Uncontrollably

127
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Weaponization

128
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:16,095
Josh Windham most

129
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Demoralization

130
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
Operation

131
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
University

132
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,671
Junior varsity narratives that he's kind of let slip in favor of

133
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,535
Just yelling General

134
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Backup

135
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
Chinese own all the movie theaters

136
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,639
All the movie houses are owned all the schools

137
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
And I leave this

138
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Is because

139
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Alex

140
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
Doesn't know he's kicked off social media

141
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
Until about halfway through the show

142
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
And I think that because

143
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
You see.

144
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Entire

145
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
You get Clues as to

146
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,263
What's going on and there's a couple of days

147
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Pieces of information

148
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
And I

149
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,271
For the storm I really do know I heard that

150
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:44,671
Contacts

151
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
Years ago

152
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,335
Alex talks about how Hillary

153
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Rachel Maddow

154
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,479
Any argument that Hillary is openly asking for the Chinese

155
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
To interfere in the election

156
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,111
R22 as opposed to ironic

157
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Going on

158
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Rachel

159
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Maddow Show

160
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
He actually said Maddow that time

161
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,223
Someone named

162
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
Being compared to Mancow Chicago Rachel Maddow

163
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
F*** you

164
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
Russia flag

165
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
Chinese

166
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Chinese communist

167
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,079
2020

168
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
Position on it

169
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Clip of the pump

170
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Imagine Rachel that you had

171
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Democratic nominees for 2020

172
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Is China

173
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Why should

174
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Have all the fun

175
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,951
Tobacco

176
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,543
Conspiracy

177
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,151
Democratic

178
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,951
Incredibly

179
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Here is what she actually

180
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
We can listen to this entire two-minute clip

181
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
Thought that he had edited

182
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:48,223
What appears to be jumped

183
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Terrible production

184
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
To the point that Alex

185
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
Intentionally never plays

186
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Looking for trumps

187
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,559
And then and then passes them to

188
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
Whatever the new Wikileaks happen

189
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,447
Dentist close

190
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Nothing wrong with that

191
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
Russia

192
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
And are still doing according to Chris

193
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Stafford

194
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Current FBI director

195
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
Star Electric Systems

196
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,087
We're worried about 2020 he said

197
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Hey

198
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,999
Sour contest to let's get the Chinese Inn on the side of somebody

199
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
Just saying that shows how absurd

200
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
The situation we find

201
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,983
It's like if you believe that

202
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
She saying

203
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,639
Really

204
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:53,503
It is it's

205
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Here's what Trump did

206
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
And I'm just putting in a

207
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
Alright

208
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
You can make the argument that what she's actually doing

209
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
She saying like

210
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Putting

211
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
Something like that never played that last fireworks

212
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,543
The situation

213
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:22,175
She's not in any way

214
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,295
The recent this is worth mentioning is that

215
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Never stop talking

216
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
About how people use edited clips

217
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:36,255
Of him

218
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Valerie

219
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Night owl

220
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,679
The show

221
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
Short little bit where she was like so

222
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
The rest of it make

223
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Makes it worse

224
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
I guess we're the

225
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
There's something

226
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Hear that

227
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
Normal Infowars listener with Alex's

228
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,863
What context did except for the end

229
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,751
Especially the fact that Matthau says

230
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
Unhelpful

231
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
So earlier we heard Alex complaining

232
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Tricom

233
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Can control all the movie

234
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
Movie studios

235
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
In the United States

236
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Understand about that

237
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Is first of all

238
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Yours to not

239
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
Because reality says that it's not true

240
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
What you don't know

241
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Is it in the past

242
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Alex's

243
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
The film fest

244
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Have you ever learned

245
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Haha

246
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Major Film Festival

247
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,327
Money

248
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
Terrible anti-American stuff we can

249
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
With each other

250
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
Alright

251
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Southpaw

252
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Filmmakers

253
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
I imagine baby drunkenly someone

254
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Like

255
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Willimantic

256
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:57,055
How emotionally raw is working

257
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Kind of

258
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
Oscar bait

259
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
And everybody knows that the Oscars love somebody

260
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
Alex

261
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Reality

262
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
He has further

263
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
From his own personal

264
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
Hollywood

265
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,359
The Chinese government

266
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
To Motion Pictures

267
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
International Market

268
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Michael Bay's entire reason

269
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
Does the Chinese government demoralize America of Emerging Markets overseas

270
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
Use for our film

271
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,663
Alex is never gone to Hollywood to be a movie

272
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
He's been into movies

273
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
They're both directed by Richard linklater

274
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
Chartley's veljohnson

275
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,376
Driving around Austin

276
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,736
So stupid

277
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Conceivably see a conversation where he could

278
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,624
If with linklater where he could get that later literally being like

279
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
Hey Charlie

280
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,936
In a couple of movies is the like Richards

281
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:06,336
I worked in intelligence 30 years ago

282
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Do you work

283
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,552
You have the veneer of credibility based on

284
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
Venus come out of Xperia

285
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,232
I think a lot about what Lee Majors thoughts on Films

286
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,328
Sure

287
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
Later in the episode Alex gets the news

288
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,472
Kicked off Instagram

289
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,288
Facebook and it will discuss the ban when it comes

290
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
But in this next clip

291
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
Before any of this has become public

292
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Like before the news broke

293
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Alex

294
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
I believe gives us a hint

295
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,040
As to what happened

296
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Behind the scene

297
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,464
Serious diseases

298
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
Paralyzing

299
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
So that that's not true

300
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
He says that he got a warning

301
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,536
Of some sort that he was going to

302
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
I guess this story was

303
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
Taken down

304
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,680
Does going to be taken down because

305
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
Erroneous

306
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,360
Sprite

307
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,944
Knowing what comes later

308
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,784
Really proved

309
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
Anything so I just left it outside

310
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Prosecco

311
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880
And I'm glad I did

312
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Because it's better

313
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Stuff.com

314
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Cuz he doesn't have much

315
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
This caller seems like

316
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,360
Everywhere I go I start up a conversation about you what is showing the world order my wife thinks I'm nuts

317
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Why you talking to high schoolers

318
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,048
About the New World Order cooler at the local bar

319
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
Stop trying to open their mind redpill them

Squaw Valley

00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
Conversation with

About

328
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
But they have

329
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,336
What's course of action research

330
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
I don't know if we want to

331
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
We can certainly

332
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,112
Middleman selling horses in the country

333
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
That's not good

334
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
The tools in the past

335
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Where's that they wanted to give

336
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Hillary Clinton

337
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
If she works

338
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
It would be a dick

339
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
You're going to hate it because I use them

340
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
What what

341
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:31,040
Yeah right

342
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:36,416
Can't be that hard to believe anyone's that stupid

343
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,000
Call RC

344
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Processing thoughts

345
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
Decently well he's not like one of those callers that I feel bad about

346
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,288
First Response

347
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,456
I can't imagine people of any

348
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Good

349
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Gaither

350
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
Mental cognition

351
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Thinking that

352
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
You give someone dictator powers

353
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,768
Then you get to take them away or they give them up because his

354
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
But that is not

355
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
Generally the past

356
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
What somebody has the kind of powers

357
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Dictators

358
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:26,336
Powers you can't take them away

359
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,408
Ignition right

360
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,712
To I don't know

361
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,552
Yeah directions

362
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,672
Loyalist forces within the military

363
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
You have

364
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
You

365
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
I can't imagine anyone

366
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,816
Thinks they know anything

367
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Expressing an opinion

368
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
It's really fun

369
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
Obviously they were going to make Hillary

370
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
And thank God that we got Trump in who is not a dick

371
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
But

372
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,152
Clearly they're not isn't

373
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:11,136
I meant

374
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
The f*** out of here

375
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,840
To give him complete and utter control but they will reserve the right to take away that control

376
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
That usually works right lusional box set

377
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
So stupid

378
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
Expressing like this

379
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Sort of language

380
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,920
I want you to hold on to that because he doesn't clarify that until

381
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968
Quite a bit later but he does

382
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
I do I do

383
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
You like they are clarified

384
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
2 minutes later and be like

385
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,304
Now I only meant that political it's a little bit later

386
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,704
For now

387
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
Violet

388
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
I'm not one of these guys who's advocating

389
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Violence

390
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,880
Terrorizing everybody

391
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,000
They're so excited

392
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Nerd

393
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,216
There wasn't so much agree with that guy but it was

394
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,176
Overthrow our f****** government there are

395
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
What are you going to do

396
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Whatever you got to do

397
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
What is that mean

398
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,832
What is the coded language

399
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
Transition of power

400
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Next week we get to his explanation

401
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,376
Where are you talkin about the idea that I wanted to capitate people

402
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,192
Of any realize I can't let that sit there

403
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:36,288
And I only play this because I want to be super fair to him

404
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,896
Never said

405
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
No be super on Thayer

406
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
Called for the decapitation

407
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,928
So only in the interest of fairness and because I don't

408
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Deer Valley

409
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,584
Discussion

410
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
Offensive action

411
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,408
President

412
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
Whatever the president does

413
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
I trust I support it

414
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:27,232
Not an offensive violence guy but

415
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Yeah every options on the table

416
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,352
Stuff like that because

417
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Yeah there's a lot of weight in the sentence

418
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Because

419
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,592
Also has

420
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Butt meaning

421
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Today

422
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,088
Things are on the table because there isn't

423
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
Show all options

424
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
That's not great

425
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
I don't

426
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Really stop for a second

427
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
Listen to

428
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
I don't care what

429
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
She has my tree

430
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
0 people in government that I trust

431
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
But

432
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
To hear that

433
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Now what is great

434
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,568
Go back from taking care of family members who are ill

435
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,664
What have you and I don't really want it is what it is

436
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,248
Going to bring it up with may come up here

437
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Is that

438
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Exposed

439
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
That she hasn't read the news

440
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,024
Because I'm like Rip Van Winkle

441
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,144
Watch the news

442
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,728
Wow

443
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:21,920
So if you haven't read the news in a year I don't care too much about Alex's bulshit

444
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,504
I would say that it makes this even more performative

445
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
It makes it all the more crap

446
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeah the idea that you could

447
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,672
In 2018 or so

448
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,488
Just not watch the news for a year

449
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:42,912
Tomorrow is the end of the world the globalist they're taking over you obviously don't

450
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
Believe that

451
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
Saying something like that is

452
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,896
Really f***** up

453
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,504
You do that's so different from what you said a year ago whenever I stopped paying attention

454
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
It's crazy

455
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:04,928
When is it going to end she's like Rip Van Winkle

456
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:10,560
For 100 years and everything was this thing

457
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,400
Infowars

458
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,240
So in this next clip before the rain comes in

459
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
Disorder promoting that she

460
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
He's going to be a studio

461
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,432
His immediate response is it

462
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Exactly what you need

463
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
I need him.

464
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
Knows what I'm doing

465
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
People are looking at his website

466
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
I need help

467
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Drudge

468
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
Because in this course

469
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
He doesn't have an angle on it yet

470
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
I haven't read anything about it

471
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,656
He just knows the people are talking about sex

472
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
Who kicked off stuff

473
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
Drudge

474
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
Comment on it till the 4th hour but I'm still going

475
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
F****** talk about stuff

476
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
It's clearly related

477
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,016
Like in that last clip for the last week but a little bit earlier when I told you

478
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:39,648
Do you give these indications of what was happening behind the scenes

479
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
About

480
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,488
The idea that immigrants

481
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,560
And like I said I waited a little bit longer

482
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,376
And Alex got even more over in this clip

483
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
And it tells me everything I need

484
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:58,080
This is what's going on

485
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
You just got to

486
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Pretty much

487
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
Has he got a warrant

488
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
Important

489
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,024
To point out that Alex is making

490
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Super clear

491
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
He got a warning about this

492
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:26,240
He's literally because of his coverage and have you

493
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,776
Use blaming immigrant populations

494
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,712
It came out of nowhere Alex tries to defend himself

495
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,088
For reporting Trunews the reality of the world

496
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,464
ABC News

497
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,120
40in measles outbreak is a foreigner which is called A outbreak start

498
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Face solely on that headline

499
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
Probably feels like he's reporting

500
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,056
Glenlivet measles outbreak started with a foreigner as the headlines today

501
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
Central America

502
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Those are the imaginary disease

503
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,992
Is masses that Alex obsesses about after all

504
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
It's that Foreigner

505
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Actual article

506
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,904
The main point of the story is not

507
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,488
Daniel Salman of Johns Hopkins

508
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,864
The foreign individuals involved in the u.s. measles outbreak are not illegal

509
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,680
Quote it's people have enough wealth

510
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
The travel

511
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,056
There's been ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe for years and it's largely because of vaccine refusal

512
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:37,664
There's also right now a bit of an outbreak happening in the New York Orthodox Jewish

513
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:44,064
And the source of this was was traced back to an individual who

514
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
Which is a super common thing

515
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,928
Not catching measles and Israel but catching interesting cuz

516
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
Does while on vacation

517
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
Navigate exactly the sort of thing

518
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
Providing travel alerts specific to whatever country someone

519
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Necessary precaution

520
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
But you just went to Mexico I'm sure you had some

521
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,312
Warnings of

522
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,360
Get a diphtheria shot or whatever

523
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,152
Make sure your current

524
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,736
Is important

525
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,904
It's not a perfect system warning people travel

526
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,232
The government

527
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Preparedness

528
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,864
So sometimes people go to a foreign country catch something and unknowingly

529
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,424
That's what this ABC News headlines

530
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Discussing

531
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,800
Misrepresenting in order to creative propaganda

532
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,616
Has to be stopped from entering country less they infect

533
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
Everyone you know

534
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,992
This is why social media companies would issue Alex a warning

535
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,040
What he's doing is very

536
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Very Danger

537
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Dehumanize immigrants

538
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,536
Chords that need to be repulsed

539
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,656
Well when you reflect on the early stages of Nazi propaganda

540
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,752
One of the things that deserve to be discussed more

541
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
Which it's not but it could be

542
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
You still need to just

543
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,664
Got the more is the

544
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Hatred of the Jews

545
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
And not these other

546
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Homosexual

547
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
It's far more important

548
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,672
To make the public not care about them

549
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,744
The quote from the Holocaust Memorial encyclopedia

550
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Quotes

551
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560

Created an atmosphere tolerances Island

554
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,472
The goal was to encourage passive

555
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,568
As a vehicle to restore public order

556
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,384
Demonize Jews also served

557
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Prepare the German population

National Emergency

560
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
A harsher measure

561
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Such as mass deportations

562
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
Eventually

563
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:57,696
If you replaced with immigrants are Muslim or drag queen Story Time participant

564
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,512
Alex Jones propaganda is indistinguishable

565
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,072
In formula from the early stages

566
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
The Third Reich

567
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
His tone and rhetoric is getting ways

568
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Scarier

569
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,008
Platform

570
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Volume

571
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
It indicates

572
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,872
Strongly that they were giving him a very undeserved benefit of the doubt

573
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
They're trying to warn him expressing ideas

574
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
Your rationalization

575
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Past atrocities

576
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
I was representing an actual story

577
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
Remind have done it by accident

578
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,232
Suspicion is that he was given the opportunity to make a correction divided misreporting

579
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,256
And when he didn't

580
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,632
It became clear that he was intentionally engaging in a demonization

581
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Regardless

582
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,472
Of the efficacy

583
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
From social media

584
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Is every consequence

585
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,408
Everything short of actually hurting or threatened

586
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
He deserve

587
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
He deserves to be

588
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
Unwelcome wherever he goes

589
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
Public

590
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
We're at a restaurant

591
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
Everywhere

592
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
He deserves

593
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Like this sort of behavior

594
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
Maybe I'll walk through the streets

595
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:19,872
Maybe we get some

596
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
Except make sure that next

597
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,136
We understand why it makes such a big difference

598
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,488
The idea that Alex's for this

599
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,328
Before because it gives a clear path of what's going on

600
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
He's

601
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
He's creating this propaganda narrative

602
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,312
Based on a misreading of a headline or the body the story completely contradict

603
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
What are you saying

604
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:56,223
Yeah I mean it's just it's very clear to me what Alex's accidentally revealed

605
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,087
Later try and take hold on this story

606
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,391
It's very clear to me that he got a warning

607
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,743
You refused to change his behavior because it's more important to him to demonize

608
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,351
Wrong in such a dangerous

609
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
620

610
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
Marginalized communities

611
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
He doesn't give a s***

612
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,055
He moves forward and when

613
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871
Free speech

614
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Prize all his

615
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Pathetic

616
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,063
The episode

617
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
What is

618
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
What angle

619
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
Can I take on this

620
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
It's really interesting

621
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
Is that

622
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
Is going to be far different

623
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
Alex

624
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
As we go along

625
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Before we get to

626
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Too far in

627
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
Care

628
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,271
About this until we see a little bit more

629
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Like if

630
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,575
It is effective

631
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
In terms of

632
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
Diminishing is platform

633
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Yeah I think

634
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
For the Public's health

635
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
History has shown that

636
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
He's been able to

637
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Flout every

638
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
Bandits come so far

639
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
So until there's some sort of proof

640
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,895
Ethika

641
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,943
I have a very hard time getting

642
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Excited

643
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,991
About

644
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Some sort of ban

645
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,575
Well the only thing about it is

646
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
Okay

647
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
Facebook you opened the box

648
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,487
What's the size of the outlet that you're going to be

649
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
Tucker Carlson has said

650
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Similar s***

651
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:51,679
Are you are you going to have the balls to go after somebody who's at Fox News

652
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,055
To see where it goes

653
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
That's the other problem with

654
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
So is that

655
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
Whatever Direction it does go

656
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
Wilkin

657
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
Confirm

658
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
Narrative

659
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,135
Yes absolutely Tucker Carlson has

660
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:16,255
Breast a lot of these dangerous ideas about Muslims

661
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,047
You know you kick them all social

662
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
Confirms Alex's

663
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
Screaming about how they're coming for you next

664
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
Yep they take me out and then they're coming for you next

665
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
So

666
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,799
There's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy

667
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Alex

668
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
It's like

669
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
If nothing happens then

670
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
He wins

671
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
All those things happened

672
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
He gets to pretend he was

673
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,599
Still come with that

674
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
Narrative that they're trying to

675
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
The band everybody

676
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:50,815
Either way

677
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
Yeah

678
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
It's hard

679
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
It's hard to

680
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
Grimaldi's

681
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
You know why

682
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,407
Googly and McAdoo was there

683
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,223
Alex Alex

684
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,791
Red Lobster

685
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,079
Weird

686
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
Real soft awkward laugh

687
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,487
We are having a little bit of conversation

688
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,887
Online empathy of the world

689
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
Realize

690
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,615
He's own fan

691
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:13,503
People who were his fans and then turned on him that he is using as an example of empathy

692
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
Exist online

693
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,303
Your mom

694
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,879
Washer with hard I mean everybody here in the studio

695
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
Sweetheart

696
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Yeah

697
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:09,823
People need to stop and like realize the energy in the world and end

698
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
Compassion for each other

699
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,119
A little bit of

700
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
Hippie instinct

701
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,007
Before she came in

702
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,311
Bubbling back to the surface and the time that she

703
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
She's been

704
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Not at

705
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
An awful thing

706
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:52,575
We should have towards other people

707
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,623
All of those theories about Alex

708
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,207
Having an affair with Leann him hurting her any of those

709
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,767
She's gone

710
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:07,167
No one who criticizes Infowars other than Austin know who Lee Ann McAdoo is

711
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
No one knows who she is

712
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
No

713
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
None of your enemies

714
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,127
Know who your staff is

715
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,527
Nope Shroyer getting yelled at by a little finger

716
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,927
No one knew who

717
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Child

718
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
No one knows who David Knight is

719
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
No no one knows

720
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
Any of these people are

721
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
Until they get sued

722
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
Like

723
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,447
Like right now

724
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:46,847
The courts know who they are

725
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,127
Trying to attack Alex

726
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
Macy's.

727
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
They were his fans

728
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
And his ex van

729
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
Who have toxic

730
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
Expenses online

731
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:00,159
Talk about how ex-boyfriend was black

732
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,767
And stuff like that

733
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,583
We would say that

734
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
I don't think that one was us

735
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
No

736
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:18,079
Personally at all

737
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,407
Observed message boards

738
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
And places like that

739
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:28,831
Are all sore

740
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
Infowars fan

741
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,159
Who think that Alex Dodgers the Jewish question

742
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,975
Stuff like that

743
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
It should be ground

744
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,631
Punishment

745
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
Along the lines of a slap

746
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,519
I think that with a straight face

747
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,311
Requires a slap to the

748
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,895
This is real life

749
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:57,247
A bucket of water Maybe

750
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
Kohl's bucket of water

751
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,135
No

752
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
Because I don't endorse his

753
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:08,767
Physical violence but

754
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:15,167
I'm for it

755
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:22,591
Some people online conspiracy theories

756
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
Well I don't think Jonathan really wants to

757
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,903
They're still wrapped up in this and probably

758
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
I don't get the sense

759
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Listening to

760
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,279
And I'm not letting her off the hook

761
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,863
Is not as enthusiastic

762
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,959
Participate in this is Alex Watts interview

763
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,567
She's way off base

764
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
In terms of Russia

765
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
I'll go with you on it

766
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,295
I'll go with you halfway but you need to look in the mirror

767
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
And see

768
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,135
Those people

769
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Exist

770
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Without

771
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
You

772
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,767
Oh yeah like without this

773
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,071
Infowars propaganda

774
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,095
So you saying that

775
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,935
Infowars not created a rabid fanbase

776
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,239
Conspiracy theory loving lunatic

777
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,567
Go off at the drop of a hat

778
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,383
Screaming about all kinds of different violent action

779
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
That they want

780
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,527
Infowars employees

781
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,623
Not employed

782
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,183
To go take care of her

783
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:46,559
Environment

784
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
Create

785
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631

Boy I don't want to say goes around comes

787
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,495
It's not quite that simple.

788
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,031
If people get these sorts of

789
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
I'm not for it but

790
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
Got you got a wreck

00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
Big knives what the soup is

II

793
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
This week these are the ingredients

794
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
You don't have to

795
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
You should before

796
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
But that's

797
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,839
Can you help me

798
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
Doesn't really work

799
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,007
Yeah and we're in the city

800
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
We're in the soup

801
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,383
Alex

802
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
To finally figured out how he's going

803
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,087
Louis Farrakhan

804
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,463
Imposition

805
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,255
So Alex decide

806
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
Fit everyone

807
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
Is being claimed

808
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
To be an anti-semite

809
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
Night Moves

810
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
That's a good

811
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Express

812
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,199
Different thing

813
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,359
It's just that

814
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:48,671
Patriots

815
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:57,375
I have the right of return

816
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,847
I like that

817
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,759
You guys are mean

818
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,415
Reno from going back to like 2009. Alex was very

819
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,975
Grill

820
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:28,095
Ideas

821
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,167
In order to make accusations

822
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
About

823
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
People Legion

824
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,127
It doesn't matter

825
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,407
Call Vincennes

826
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,503
He was completely denying the fact

827
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,807
His ex-wife

828
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,855
Heritage at all

829
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:56,255
Now he's totally fine really been a big part of it and two crying people are talking about the idea

830
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
It's sort of Poker

831
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Fun

832
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,983
Piece of Alex's / Atarax

833
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
See how completely

834
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,335
Inverted

835
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,943
It is in the pocket of Israel or anything like that

836
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
Convenience

837
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
He is

838
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,879
At this is this is an easy way to let himself off the hook

839
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
For all of the wild lettuce

840
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
Deeply auntie

841
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:36,447
It doesn't mean that most of it ideas

842
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:40,031
Like that doesn't let you off the hook for those or

843
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,383
If it was the early 1930s

844
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,175
He would be demonizing Jews all over

845
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Of course

846
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,295
You're a popular to demonize he's going to be on the 4th

847
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,647
Where were the populists

848
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
Have you quotes

849
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
You will go

850
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,071
You're looking at him over the course of the year

851
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,607
South

852
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
Anyway

853
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,959
He's decided the story is going to be

854
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
That's why he was

855
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,799
Kicked off

856
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:20,223
Alzheimer's that this was all just people calling Zucker

857
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
Herberger

858
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
So

859
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
Gets a little bit heady

860
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,767
Talking about how she was out like

861
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Get outside the city

862
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
You look up

863
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
Stars

864
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,679
If we have

865
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,703
This would have been

866
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
K-LOVE a unit

867
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
That sort of thing we can look up to

868
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
How small we are in the grand

869
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,183
Alex Project Camelot

870
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,023
We were able to flex back in the day

871
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,071
People were able to see the sky like that

872
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:13,471
It would really put how small we are in perspective and how

873
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
To be really

874
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,031
Little people

875
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
Satellites

876
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,367
Also she like

877
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,935
Alex Smith

878
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,007
I believe

879
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
Scrap

880
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,943
Hillary isn't in charge because

881
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,527
It implies that he sings

882
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
Doesn't it

883
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
Terminix

884
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:09,279
Necessarily

885
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:16,447
All right there

886
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
Can see both sides

887
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,455
I like the camper love go out there

888
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Get my hands dirty

889
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,295
I love it

890
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,575
Disgusting

891
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Sometime

892
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,647
So it is next clip

893
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,671
Complain

894
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,119
This because I just want to get it at 17

895
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,655
Because it's so crazy

896
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
Leanne is complaining

897
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:54,079
About the idea that stories about Alex Jones

898
00:58:54,335 --> 00:59:00,479
And there's the story but people are just going to read the headlines of the stories about Alex

899
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
Things about Alec

900
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Which is crazy

901
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,927
Control

902
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
Alex Jones

903
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:36,575
Evolve to the point where they don't even read the articles they just read the headline

904
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,367
They read the headlines and they read

905
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,439
150 characters that might be in a Facebook post

906
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Your boss

907
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,767
Who you're sitting next to is

908
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,815
The king of just reading headline

909
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:52,191
And has already said on this episode that Facebook

910
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,751
About it

911
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,287
Because most likely

912
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,127
He was operating entirely office about a headline

913
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
This is Dawn

914
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
Bring back the stock

915
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,063
I want people throwing lettuce at their face 424

916
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,111
Southland

917
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
Without

918
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,183
E-coli

919
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,719
90%

920
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,743
You can put

921
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
One quarter of a bug

922
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:24,191
Quarter of a quarter of a bug

923
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,407
It turns out that Alex is banned for being at peace

924
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
And all that stuff

925
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,575
Major pieces

926
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
He was a real.

927
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,095
So he didn't even know that Paul had been back

928
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,399
Along with

929
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,591
20 characters of the tweets

930
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:08,223
I'm a little bit earlier.

931
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:12,575
For Alex to get around part because he has a dedicated staff

932
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
You keep making

933
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,951
Whenever one of his

934
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:22,303
As I said in the past when they called off one of my testicle three more grow back

935
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,351
Which is definitely

936
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,911
Sound like the hero of this story

937
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:31,007
The right to be more effective

938
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,103
Wired

939
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,407
Facebook and Instagram

940
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,199
All their personal and professional ikaw

941
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,783
Organization

942
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
Are no longer permitted on either platform

943
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,415
Account

944
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,207
To represent them part

945
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
Is going to be

946
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,767
Kralik I believe

947
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
Yeah

948
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,119
0 basic social media Outlets to protect their users

949
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,423
0

950
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
We'll see what happens

951
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,263
But it's a little more than this

952
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Today's our number

953
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,359
It might be another matter for a couple other people

954
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
Involved

955
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,431
Namely Milo and Laura Loomer

956
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,991
Alex Paul Joseph Watson

957
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
Infowars

958
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,863
The Griff and really the reason becomes clear it circumstances like this

959
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
Their only skills are agitate

960
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Is there really a journalist

961
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:37,055
Social media ban wouldn't be there work since they could write it devastated

962
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,639
Peace on the road website or blog

963
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,687
Source

964
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,247
Picked up by at least

965
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,783
A number of independent

966
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Places

967
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
You could get something in the intercept

968
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
If you were actually doing

969
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,415
Some sort of good work

970
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
About this

971
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,255
If they were concerned about the

972
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,583
Might have wizards

973
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,983
Actually blacklisted writer

974
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
Their supporters

975
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
McCarthy era

976
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
I like the idea of life

977
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,991
People like lubar have nothing

978
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,575
I empathize with her freaking out nearby

979
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
Thought of her

980
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,903
Spoiler alert we are going to talk a little bit about that

981
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
Episode

982
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:30,047
I don't want to make a mockery of someone who may very well be having a mental health episode

983
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
But make no mistake

984
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
The Freak Out

985
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,191
Globalist

986
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,007
It's Ono my scam doesn't really work without

987
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Periscope

988
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,823
Comes from the recognition

989
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,359
This is the end of the road

990
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,967
Freddy

991
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,295
Concerned that we as a podcast

992
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
Have no fear

993
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:58,207
Facebook said videos radio Clips articles and other content for

994
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,023
From the site are explicitly condemning the material

995
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:06,143
I think our conversation has been pretty explicit

996
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,007
Who's wired article includes

997
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,799
We hope that this could be in effect

998
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
To ban against

999
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,431
Quotes books Thursday bank closes a loophole

1000
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,967
The one where Alex could just

1001
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:26,111
Usually reserved for terrorist organization

1002
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:26,879
Excel

1003
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:32,255
Claim papers are still reserved for terrorists

1004
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:41,727
I would say that fits well within the bill right it's not an automated algorithm

1005
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
People who

1006
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
Appear to be

1007
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,039
Taking down

1008
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Taking care of it

1009
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
This is good

1010
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:04,255
Alex is running an organization that motivated by inspiring white Western terrorism in apologizing for

1011
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,279
For when it does happen

1012
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,559
Excuses for it

1013
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:10,911
And also deceptively selling fish oil

1014
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,215
Company is deciding

1015
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,007
Incorrect

1016
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,311
This isn't the free-speech issue in the

1017
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,407
And ultimately the irony of the situation is the only way that Alex

1018
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,503
Decision is to try and get Trump to help it with executive orders

1019
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,855
For years he screamed bloody murder about overpowered executive branch in

1020
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,159
Evils of the federal government

1021
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,463
And now

1022
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
To stay afloat

1023
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,583
Is the advocate for the federal government to step in dictate what

1024
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,887
Speech is or is not allowed by a private business

1025
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,191
Basically have to argue against

1026
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,727
Free speech in order to save his

1027
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
Suppose right to be on Facebook

1028
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,335
Which should be fun to see him been himself into a pretzel

1029
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:56,735
We all get angry enough

1030
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Enough that we don't have to

1031
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,063
Free speech that were like okay Trump give it back now

1032
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,511
To kill her for a minute

1033
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,119
To put it briefly

1034
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
Because I think

1035
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Things that I said there might

1036
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
Sound

1037
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,007
Victory or a little bit

1038
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,543
Play soda still at this 8

1039
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
I think

1040
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,407
Alex has the resources

1041
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,687
Disposal currently

1042
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
UB employees

1043
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:35,391
The built-in infrastructure of being able to have people

1044
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:40,255
I think he has those things

1045
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,791
Incredibly difficult

1046
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
To stick

1047
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,119
However the fact that they're saying

1048
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
That they're going to

1049
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,447
Treat this like

1050
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,239
Knock down these dummy accounts

1051
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:58,175
I think that's inspiring in someone

1052
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,967
We'll see what happens

1053
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
Not Super Optimus

1054
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,807
I think Milo and Laura Arkham

1055
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
Completely fuk

1056
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,183
John with whatever hussle's they've been on

1057
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:12,255
Cuz Milo relied entirely on

1058
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,559
Yeah

1059
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
He got that kicked off of

1060
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
Ineffective

1061
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
Infrastructure

1062
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,727
He was only being able to publish it

1063
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,007
His books and disseminate

1064
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
Because of that Bond

1065
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,335
Yeah

1066
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
Instagram

1067
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,431
I don't see what kind of hustle he can pull off

1068
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Laura Loomer has no towel

1069
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
She's only good

1070
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
Brouhaha

1071
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,367
Without access to

1072
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,903
Streaming materials and

1073
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
Like that she has nothing

1074
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
I think that's where she's

1075
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Going to go next

1076
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,095
I wish you the best

1077
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
Going to be a road that's open

1078
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,703
We'll see what you think

1079
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
For May 2nd

1080
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,383
Alex is found

1081
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Kicked off

1082
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
Social media

1083
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,759
It starts

1084
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
Maybe

1085
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
Maybe he's.

1086
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,071
You have really great people on the team would be able to

1087
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:24,191
The time to recharge and warriors

1088
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,471
Figurative

1089
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
Would like

1090
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:35,455
He wants to leave earlier

1091
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,223
He gets high when he

1092
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
Gardening

1093
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,807
Some plants

1094
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:47,487
Scratch but I do enjoy it

1095
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,279
Go to that you'll be seeing Santa Claus in

1096
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
Nothing it's really interesting

1097
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,775
And then also understand that like

1098
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:03,359
You think of a plant is like I've been on the same

1099
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,663
You can interact with

1100
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,967
Over the play

1101
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,271
Because you just come and you see

1102
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
It's right here

1103
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,903
You don't see them over the course of a day yeah it's really interesting

1104
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,951
Move a lot more than you think

1105
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,023
From the experience of

1106
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:28,191
Sir Alex go f****** be a gardener

1107
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,983
You might think that was just a

1108
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:30,751
Estrella Falls

1109
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,967
I'm just saying

1110
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,039
Just picking corn

1111
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,367
You know what corner

1112
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:51,999
The reason why

1113
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:58,399
There's a reason why a lot of us are

1114
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:04,031
The basics of what is real

1115
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,311
Money-power

1116
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,759
So he's telling his audience angel

1117
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,319
Is pretty f***** up

1118
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
Really

1119
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
Maybe

1120
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,623
To do that

1121
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,375
F*** it up

1122
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:34,239
I'm having dreams of sweeping

1123
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
Uchealth

1124
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,359
Fall asleep

1125
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:44,991
Hillary face at all take a bunch of krill oil and I trip balls taking about

1126
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:45,759
Shores

1127
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Piece of corn

1128
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
Looks like Hillary

1129
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:54,719
Expiration date

1130
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
I mean

1131
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,583
Is really important as a

1132
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,935
Alex is so unhinged

1133
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
As a person

1134
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
I'm so on board

1135
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
From like

1136
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
Any kind of bearing

1137
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
Keeping him

1138
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
In place

1139
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:16,991
Over the course of the show you do hear him screaming about decapitating his enemies

1140
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,319
My games appear

1141
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:24,159
Eva

1142
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
F*** it I want a garden

1143
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,791
I want get out of here

1144
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:36,447
Music

1145
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,847
Because there are

1146
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,383
He has no sense

1147
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,919
He has no ability

1148
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,687
B2

1149
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,855
Sad

1150
01:11:54,111 --> 01:12:00,255
There's a lot more

1151
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,839
You have a lot of employees here you could

1152
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,399
She doesn't know that

1153
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,471
He does not but

1154
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,007
It is it is a

1155
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,079
It's interesting because this episode

1156
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,871
Heavily and come again

1157
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
Kind of giving

1158
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,991
Assemblance of

1159
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759
Empathy

1160
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
To Alex

1161
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:29,439
Care for himself at least a little bit

1162
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Alex

1163
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,791
Yeah it's also the inverse of what's going to be

1164
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
The May 3rd at

1165
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,911
Keep on keep that in mind

1166
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,447
Laura Loomer

1167
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,031
Nobu

1168
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,871
The third here with Alex

1169
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
Having

1170
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
Talk to his lawyer

1171
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
The night before

1172
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,015
He's on a much better footing

1173
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,599
She is a little bit of a manic energy

1174
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,415
He's going to prove that everyone is wrong

1175
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,255
He's going to lay it all out episode

1176
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,303
It's going to be

1177
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,839
Comparison

1178
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,679
An old-fashioned

1179
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:17,055
F****** cash register every time

1180
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,103
He does show up on the

1181
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,735
Smoking Gun

1182
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,839
Rosebud

1183
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,751
Crucify him

1184
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
Oh man

1185
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
He's got proof

1186
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,743
Dunham dirty

1187
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,887
I couldn't stop you're probably right

1188
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
Factually inaccurate Alex

1189
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Is too fat

1190
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
To crucify

1191
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:20,287
Come on man

1192
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
Lesbian

1193
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:27,711
Clip

1194
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:34,111
Because it was the most important thing he's ever covers

1195
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,231
Because this is officially the most important

1196
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,255
Alex's ever cover

1197
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,583
24 a

1198
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,895
The most important

1199
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
Information

1200
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,855
The fog

1201
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,695
You see the sunrise

1202
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
I'm coming up

1203
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
Aurelio's Magic Moment

1204
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:41,695
I was blown away by that term that looks really thought

1205
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:48,095
I see everything the fog is lifted I see the globalist plan

1206
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:54,495
Nothing is laid out in front of me instead it's actually beautiful

1207
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:08,575
Not good that was very weird I really enjoyed that though it was a ride

1208
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:16,511
Visual metaphor he's making out like outside

1209
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:20,863
Experience before the fog break

1210
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:27,263
You see a beautiful landscaping front of you absolutely

1211
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:30,079
I was along for the ride

1212
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Just

1213
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,871
Neck-breaking

1214
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
Twist

1215
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,943
Yeah especially

1216
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
Important

1217
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,439
So

1218
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,207
Tunupa

1219
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
Pieces that he's trying to add to the

1220
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
The band narrative

1221
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,047
The first

1222
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,375
Is Mastercard

1223
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,423
Make sure

1224
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,007
If you give any money to people they don't like

1225
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,799
They're going to erase your account

1226
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,895
Doesn't sound legal

1227
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,815
Built

1228
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,311
MasterCard

1229
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,247
Spokes

1230
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,535
Blueprint

1231
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,327
4 something

1232
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,495
I won't say a word because

1233
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,335
Antichrist works

1234
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:21,183
Like there's a room in MasterCard where they're all sitting around with the Book of Revelations going like alright

1235
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,511
How are we going to get the second one

1236
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:31,167
We are over budget

1237
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,703
The revelation

1238
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,871
Alright alright

1239
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,807
As I understand it is it MasterCard is putting these

1240
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,599
Are there any type of conversation

1241
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,903
Human rights

1242
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,695
Emissions as part of their board

1243
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,791
Yeah turn off your account

1244
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,327
Breathing

1245
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,095
Transaction

1246
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Places

1247
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,311
Specifically but you know what I mean

1248
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,359
They would just cancel that transaction

1249
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,151
You can't use our service

1250
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,943
To give that money

1251
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,527
Right not the same thing is you need to

1252
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,111
You give money to your account

1253
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:27,487
Yeah that's really going to limit Putin's ability to unrefined

1254
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,815
Because he uses MasterCard

1255
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,119
American

1256
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,703
American Express commercial

1257
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:38,495
He was with Trump at the time

1258
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:44,127
I started learning Russian but I don't know how to say what's in your wallet

1259
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:47,967
This point I cannot I only know that woman is

1260
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,271
Jenna should know that

1261
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,295
I like it

1262
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:55,135
For process

1263
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,231
Apple

1264
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,935
So is the MasterCard

1265
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,727
Is going to take away all your money

1266
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,263
If you're a bad boy

1267
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,408
Rebel Without a card

1268
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,944
Haha

1269
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
He's putting for

1270
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,112
Is that now if you're on this bad boy lip

1271
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,184
They're also trying to make

1272
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,720
You can't use phone

1273
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
Anymore

1274
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,864
Sing off of Oliver.

1275
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,424
Being interviewed on CNN

1276
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
About his

1277

Instagram

1282
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,584
Scrutiny from people who are saying hey

1283
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,936
You know you guys bad why are you allowing them to the present

1284
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,032
Tony Banning Alex Jones

1288
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,576
What the heck

1289
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
Unclear

1290
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:31,904
WhatsApp app

1291
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,608
Water from Facebook

1292
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,144
Water off

1293
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,936
That we only oxygen now

1294
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:54,176
Would you be regulated like

1295
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:57,760
I think he is back on

1296
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,552
He doesn't care about that in

1297
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,600
Intel personal

1298
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,696
Important

1299
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:12,096
Place where there are people on both sides calling for the same thing

1300
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
Perspective

1301
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:16,448
The idea of

1302
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,776
F****** break up Facebook

1303
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,568
But yes

1304
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,408
Elizabeth Warren

1305
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,296
Still much comes down to like why

1306
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,880
Is it because your hustle is being interrupted

1307
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,232
I will take you

1308
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
I will side with honest

1309
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,096
Similar issue

1310
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,216
Alex is trying to

1311
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,336
Oliver Darcy is coming here on spaghetti

1312
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
B Alex

1313
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,384
To have his abilities

1314
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Taken away

1315
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,736
Facebook owns WhatsApp

1316
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
You don't know

1317
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,784
WhatsApp

1318
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
To text

1319
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
You don't need it to call people

1320
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,672
It's just an applications that you can

1321
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,208
Use or not

1322
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,280
There's a hundred different ways you can text and call people

1323
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,352
It's absurd to think like I'm being kicked off WhatsApp

1324
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,680
Because it's owned by the same company that kicked me off stuff

1325
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
Now I

1326
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
Text ever

1327
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
It's silly

1328
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
It's clear

1329
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
I don't know

1330
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,760
It's not clear

1331
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,672
Calling WhatsApp

1332
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,000
Breaking the terms

1333
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,048
Of WhatsApp

1334
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:50,912
Allowed to stay on Instagram for the time that he was

1335
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,448
Kicked off Facebook

1336
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,520
Broke

1337

1339
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,528
A bunch of regulations

1340
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:10,624
Propaganda

1341
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,512
Burnt

1342
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,792
WhatsApp

1343
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,096
Email threads

1344
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,632
Control

1345
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,752
I've never used it I've never talked to anybody

1346
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,872
A couple

1347
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,152
Stories Longo's

1348
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,712
Larger point for our show.

1349
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,272
Increase

1350
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,808
The scope of what this

1351
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
Because he needs

1352
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,880
Look apocalyptic

1353
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
Because it's

1354
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
Well I still have some faith

1355
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,072
Dukes of Hazzard

1356
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:56,960
Generally over the

1357
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,752
He realizes

1358
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,520
He's in a bit of

1359
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
Because

1360
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,616
From what Facebook is saying

1361
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,408
Seems to be born

1362
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,808
Comprehensive it looks like it's going to be

1363
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,832
A bigger thing

1364
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,136
Hit the employee

1365
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,696
Infowars

1366
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,768
His contact as if it were just

1367
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,560
Infowars account

1368
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
So

1369
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,400
Is rightfully worried

1370
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,472
He needs to Double Down

1371
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,264
This is just happening

1372
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
Because they say

1373
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Somatic and

1374
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:46,624
Directions

1375
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,928
Yes I do

1376
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Is really sick

1377
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,312
Be weird

1378
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,360
It's not

1379
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,712
Also you can be pro-israel

1380
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:21,440
Just based on a couple years back

1381
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976
Ikea

1382
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
It's

1383
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:31,168
He's trying to present their and the reason that he's trying

1384
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,984
To use

1385
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,264
Taken down

1386
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,032
Because

1387
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,360
Create that as

1388
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
Distraught

1389
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Version of

1390
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:46,528
The big reason is because about a month ago he got in trouble for

1391
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,296
Systemic pose

1392
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,600
He's trying to complete that's it

1393
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,624
Situation with the prison

1394
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,928
Which are completely different things

1395
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,464
We also know that he

1396
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,280
Messenger

1397
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:03,680
Precipitate

1398
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,752
This is the reality

1399
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,800
Did you just joined us

1400
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,408
Discussion

1401
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,600
March

1402
01:27:53,856 --> 01:28:00,000
Piece of art on Instagram that played on medic Protocols of the Elders of Zion

1403
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,560
Throat with a hashtag wake up America

1404
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:09,472
The email chain that was disgusting article on Business Insider

1405
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,264
And the way it was being present

1406
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,056
Posted on Alex's

1407
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Infowars

1408
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,664
And the discussion was whether or not

1409
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,200
Itself broke their Community standard

1410
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,528
What member of the policy team clearly pointed out quotes

1411
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:24,320
This image is widely acknowledged

1412
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,344
380 Smith

1413
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,160
It is a famous the public controversy

1414
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:28,928
Mercy around it

1415
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,792
Commented on it and then got a lot of blowback

1416
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,864
Not look closely that

1417
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,656
Bucked up

1418
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,216
Was taken down

1419
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,312
Current issue Alex

1420
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
Because I'm

1421
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
Episode

1422
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,712
How from May 2nd Alex at the Facebook

1423
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,808
That were the problem

1424
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:59,136
This has nothing to do with it is very realized

1425
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,464
Muddy the waters about very

1426
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,768
Issue

1427
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,072
Is so much easier for him to manipulate

1428
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,120
Then the very idea

1429
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:13,728
And I refuse to acknowledge

1430
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:19,616
That I was wrong and correct my behavior

1431
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,200
He was also playing on anti-muslim

1432
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:32,416
And he can easily rely on yelling about Elon Omar and how she hates his real daddy loves

1433
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,184
Somatic

1434
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,000
Play Vanessa

1435
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,304
The intentionally lied about news article noted

1436
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
About hatred

1437
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:42,656
And that's what he wants to do cuz it's easier

1438
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,960
What others do you have

1439
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
That really you

1440
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
Please forward

1441
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:53,152
You can't defense if the truth is

1442
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,968
I got a warning about a dishonest

1443
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,528
Clearly

1444
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,832
F*****-up story that I was pushing

1445
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,368
Trying to demonize

1446
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
Micro population

1447
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,464
Representative

1448
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,512
The story I got a really gracious

1449
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,048
Offer to

1450
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,840
Correct what I was putting into the world

1451
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:14,656
Icicle f*** yourself and then they kick me off

1452
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,960
It's really hard to Garner any kind of

1453
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,728
Support from

1454
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,008
The president

1455
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,032
From

1456
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,056
Mainstream

1457
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,848
Conservatives those sorts of folks

1458
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,896
It's really tough it's much

1459
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,944
Easier to say I'm

1460
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,712
Semitism

1461
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:30,272
And I'm not they don't even give any proof of it

1462
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,088
It's all just because I'm a conservative and I

1463
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:33,856
I support Trump

1464
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,928
Do-it-yourself free speech

1465
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,232
It's so much easier to play that game

1466
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,792
Accidentally slipped

1467
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,352
On this episode

1468
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:48,192
This exact same thing happening

1469
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,008
Behind the said that I probably would have no idea

1470
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,616
That would just make you was a liar without a specific

1471
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
Yep

1472
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,760
Every time

1473
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
There's a warning

1474
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,808
Every time

1475
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:06,624
Yep single f****** time

1476
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,160
It's something bad happens to him

1477
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,232
I'm certain that someone is giving him the opportunity

1478
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
To do the right thing

1479
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,328
There is

1480
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,608
Undoubtedly

1481
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,888
Some sort of a

1482
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:18,912
Please stop

1483
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,728
We know it in the case of the Sandy Hook case

1484
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
They're absolutely

1485
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,288
A please stop

1486
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,848
But he just didn't give a s*** about an ignored

1487
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
I'm certain

1488
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:34,016
And how do you unlock I even though those lawsuits

1489
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,552
Vague

1490
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
Still give him a

1491
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:40,928
He has been given every opportunity to do the right thing

1492
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
He never does

1493
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,024
These are just consequences

1494
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,144
Why

1495
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,496
Are like 18 Sprint

1496
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,776
Warnings in like

1497
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,592
We're going to do something

1498
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,384
Bars like go f*** yourself

1499
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:06,272
It was just the same situation Alex

1500
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,832
I was trying to call

1501
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,952
Really what's going on

1502
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,720
Is the

1503
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
Conspiracy

1504
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,400
I don't remember exactly how it work

1505
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
Convoluted

1506
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,008
Title for this clip

1507
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,544
This is not

1508
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,120
Flagpole

1509
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
Why about

1510
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:14,112
Alex has a month ago he had this

1511
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,136
Weather

1512
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
Instagram because of

1513
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,440
Very

1514
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:19,744
He posted

1515
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
With the caption wake up America

1516
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,352
And then there were

1517
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,144
Conversations

1518
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:26,912
Violated

1519
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,936
Blue

1520
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,264
And the middle management was like

1521
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:38,688
Now they're like

1522
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,504
To provide cover to make it look like they're not just

1523
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Trump

1524
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:51,232
Whatever by the throat Louis Farrakhan

1525
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
Conspiracy.

1526
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,960
This is pretty much

1527
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,568
Of the Third

1528
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,592
He said he is

1529
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,384
Total proof

1530
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,480
That's

1531
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:19,136
That's better article about an Instagram post from a month ago and then he say

1532
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,744
Pacifica

1533
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,536
Produces them

1534
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,376
He's never quoted from them never said what they say

1535
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,192
Oakridge from

1536
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
Means I don't exist

1537
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,520
So it seems shocking

1538
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,576
Politico

1539
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:58,048
First

1540
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,704
So first

1541
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,240
Came for the Nazi

1542
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,104
Everything was fine

1543
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,224
They came for the slave minorities and I said nothing

1544
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
Because I wasn't at my door.

1545
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,368
The paper you weren't.

1546
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,512
Silly in reverse

1547
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
So I feel that so weird

1548
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,896
Itsfunneh

1549
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:48,992
Is super like whatever Trump wants to do I trust him

1550
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,272
Because that's before the bay

1551
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
How we doing

1552
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,032
King Soopers

1553
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,824
You were someone like Trump

1554
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,616
Why would you ever trust Alex

1555
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:22,016
Everybody has shown himself to be completely unreliable

1556
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:25,600
12 sec separation

1557
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,416
I think he's got a lot of what you wanted out of

1558
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:34,048
Shifting the public discourse more acceptable

1559
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,096
Those are absolutely

1560
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,376
Are the Galaxy

1561
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,704
But if you are the person in power

1562
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,264
You got to know this person like Alex

1563
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,640
Don't give a f*** about him

1564
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:54,272
Things are going good for him on May 2nd

1565
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,832
He thinks that you should start a dictatorship

1566
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:01,184
On May 3rd

1567
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,256
F****** done your dictatorship

1568
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
He's going to pieces

1569
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
Suspicious

1570
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,352
Kind of

1571
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,120
Consistency

1572
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
Self-centeredness

1573
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,960
Victor Alex operator

1574
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:19,360
Yeah that's a wide spectrum in a very short. Of time

1575
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
You really was just fantasizing about

1576
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,992
She's mental state

1577
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,272
Jeff

1578
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,808
You should quit

1579
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,088
Pull the trigger

1580
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:29,856
You should definitely

1581
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,624
Equip

1582
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:33,952
Doing

1583
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,232
Is a

1584
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,072
It's almost like the audience or a group of investors

1585
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
His show

1586
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
Okay just

1587
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,216
Indiegogo

1588
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,288
Alright with the next

1589
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,952
We are going to ship

1590
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,048
Interpersonal

1591
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,432
Do you want this

1592
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,200
F******

1593
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,296
All the people you don't like

1594
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,832
Give me a lot of money

1595
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,136
That's just

1596
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
I find

1597
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,208
Narratives

1598
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,256
Points like a progression

1599
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:46,400
I think there's going to be way too much

1600
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,240
Lawsuit

1601
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
That was

1602
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:51,776
Is the pitch

1603
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
That kept us from getting a second

1604
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,104
Season of Firefly

1605
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:58,688
In there and he was like all right here's what I got

1606
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:04,320
I'm just going to do a bunch of people that I don't like Malcolm is going to be on the sides

1607
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,648
Nope will give you a movie about years later

1608
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,416
Alright

1609
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,608
Billions got to go

1610
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:20,192
Alright fight

1611
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:28,896
So it is excellent I just kept this in largely to reinforce how willing Alex's to use his key

1612
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
Kids Jewish heritage

1613
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,968
Because it's convenient

1614
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,760
For as before

1615
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,528
He pretended

1616
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:18,816
Clear that I do not care at all about his kids

1617
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,096
Jewish order

1618
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,656
Like that is that means nothing to me

1619
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,704
I am not interested in it

1620
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,496
He uses it

1621
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:30,848
That is the only thing I just want to be

1622
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,872
It could be

1623
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:36,480
Not easily but it could be misconstrued that I think it matters

1624
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,016
In some way because we're talkin

1625
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,320
Think about it and I do not at all care

1626
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,672
Deserve every ounce of privacy

1627
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,744
About who they are

1628
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,024
The children deserve

1629
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,584
I am only interested in

1630
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,608
Duwe Alex

1631
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,376
Uses

1632
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,680
Of their identity

1633
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,240
And who they are when it's convenient

1634
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,776
And lies about it

1635
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,408
Laura Loomer

1636
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,432
Showing up

1637
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:09,504
And I want to be clear about this

1638
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,576
I've no interest in making fun of someone who's going

1639
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,112
Through a mental break

1640
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:18,720
I do not believe that

1641
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,280
Did she is having AC

1642
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,560
Experimental brakes

1643
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,864
If I miss

1644
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,168
I empathize with what she's going

1645
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,960
Through and I apologize

1646
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,496
For making fun of it

1647
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,800
But based on what

1648
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,080
I think

1649
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
She makes it a little bit

1650
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
Clear

1651
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:39,456
Is just making money anymore

1652
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,504
Like in this first clip

1653
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,784
I really think

1654
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,576
But she's being too overt

1655
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,856
This is about money

1656
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,880
Rush

1657
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,160
This thing is

1658
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,976
Lawsuits

1659
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,584
Baking soda performative aspects of hiring

1660
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,376
50 lawyers

1661
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,936
In order to make it look like they're going

1662
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:38,080
This is a hustle in and of itself the lawsuit Hustle

1663
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,104
Is something worth

1664
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
Hey give me a ton of money

1665
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,920
I will pretend to fight

1666
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:48,320
The people you don't like

1667
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,600
$2,000 I can

1668
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
Can pay my lawyer

1669
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,672
$5,000 to write a brief

1670
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:55,488
And that'll take a while to be dismissed

1671
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
Time.

1672
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:58,816
Can you give me

1673
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:05,216
Most likely intervening time

1674
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,752
To Garner at

1675
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,848
Towards whatever I do through periscopes where I

1676
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,408
Help myself to the door or Twitter or

1677
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,456
Go to the Facebook

1678
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,016
Demand someone see me

1679
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,576
Glass clips

1680
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,856
Suing chair

1681
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,416
Calphalon American

1682
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:32,608
Nobody here that sort of statement the obvious first question anyway

1683
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,888
Thinking person should ask is

1684
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,752
In November 2014

1685
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:42,592
Designated a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates

1686
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:52,576
Uae's former their foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al nahyan

1687
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,112

Extremism

1690
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:03,072
Go ahead and just designate just about anybody other pair organization

1691
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,096
And you know why

1692
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:08,704
Because of accusations that UAE was wrapped up in the financing of 9/11

1693
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,544
And allegations that they were trying to open it

1694
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,080
Back in 2013

1695
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:18,176
The UAE has been incredibly gun-shy about the idea of being a social

1696
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Group

1697
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,016

Without pointing out that it was in 2014 by the United Arab Emirates

1706

01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,128
After that point

1719
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,152
Condemned

1720
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:25,760
We consistently with

1721
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,832
I don't support him off today

1722
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,112
We condemn suicide

1723
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,696
Speaking out against

1724
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:42,144
Where are they

1725
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,544
The co-founder supported

1726
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,872
94 ization hasnat

1727
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:57,248
Information

1728
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,808
As for the Muslim Brotherhood stuff

1729
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,112
Conservative attack

1730
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:05,440
Whatever their someone arriving propagandist doesn't like

1731
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:08,768
Please vaguely Middle Eastern

1732
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
With the Muslim Brotherhood

1733
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,352
I seen this play out over and over again salad

1734
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:16,192
And I can't find any credible sources that Lake Kerr in the Muslim Brotherhood

1735
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:18,752
So I just got to assume that loomer's soft bulshit

1736
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
Is more of the same

1737
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,592
Yeah you can

1738
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,176
Trump is moving to get them at

1739
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,832
The ideas that

1740
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,112
The connection with Hamas

1741
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,648
So deep in the past

1742
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,184
And something that's very

1743
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,208
Understandable

1744
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
And

1745
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:39,744
Not

1746
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,280
Really

1747
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,608
To make them look like a terrorist organization

1748
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:47,168
If you have to do them in the United States

1749
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:50,752
Recognized as a terrorist organization

1750
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:52,544
The facts

1751
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,336
Chino's

1752
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,360
UA

1753
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,408
Designated that way

1754
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:59,456
She knows that that lawsuit is used

1755
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:00,992
Your honor

1756
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,576
The UAE has designated care as a

1757
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,624
A terrorist organization

1758
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:10,208
Legal system

1759
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:15,072
To use the uae's legal definition

1760
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:15,840
Now

1761
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:18,144
You're using a lot of words

1762
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,936
Sure and I get where they're coming

1763
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
But

1764
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240
Come on

1765
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,264
Just this once

1766
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,336
You have to understand

1767
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,616
Steve her

1768
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,896
Having a tough time

1769
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,456
Building this up too much

1770
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
But she doesn't

1771
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,272
Okay little bit

1772
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:38,624
In the same interview that this is like

1773
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,744
I need people to fund my lawsuit money because I'm suing

1774
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,536
Is a terrorist designated organization

1775
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,096
She knows damn well

1776
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:48,864
It's never going to work

1777
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:51,168
Workout

1778
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:51,936
Scam

1779
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,984
It's a lawsuit Hustle

1780
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,032
And I want to make this abundantly clear

1781
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,824
Continues to go on

1782
01:47:59,104 --> 01:47:59,616
Give her money

1783
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:25,984
Seems right I probably don't want to be involved with your gross publicity stunt

1784
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:31,104
Like when she went in there

1785
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:34,944
She doesn't understand that maybe some of the people not supporting her

1786
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,992
Part of its Subs

1787
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,784
And part of its Style

1788
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:46,464
It's a little bit of something that like

1789
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:50,048
You don't want to be involved with the girl who

1790
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:56,448
Trust yourself to one door instead of two

1791
01:48:56,704 --> 01:49:02,848
Like by Yo whatever just give us a call

1792
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:11,296
Employees could still get in and out the door

1793
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:17,184
Embarrassing

1794
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
Really it

1795
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:27,424
Steven Universe

1796
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,192
Doesn't

1797
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,008
The hustle was busy

1798
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,312
It doesn't she's not very good at this

1799
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:37,920
It was still pretty profitable

1800
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:43,296
But now without the ability to use periscope

1801
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:45,856
Instagram

1802
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,624
Like this

1803
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,160
It's tough for her

1804
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,720
Going to work

1805
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:54,816
So at this point she complains that everyone has ruined

1806
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,888
Remind

1807
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,168
Conservative

1808
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,448
And part of the party

1809
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,472
Personal

1810
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:31,424
How much are

1811
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:40,384
You might have answered your own question

1812
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,408
Kicked out

1813
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,016
But regardless of the dream Oliver Darcy

1814
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,064
She said

1815
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,624
I chase

1816
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:57,024
And then for some reason they kicked me out of CPAC I chased someone and then confronted them angrily about

1817
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,096
Something unacceptable

1818
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,632
For a conference

1819
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,168
Yeah I don't

1820
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,984
I think that means reasonable

1821
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,776
Strange world

1822
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,056
Road

1823
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:12,128
What's acceptable

1824
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:16,736
Is that not okay

1825
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,368
Gralia G6

1826
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,648
Conversation about what

1827
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,232
Send someone in a costume

1828
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:30,304
And then being kicked out

1829
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:36,960
Alright

1830
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:38,496
And from

1831
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,152
It's about how like her like

1832
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,688
Everyone's ruined her life

1833
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,480
Jedi I mean

1834
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:52,832
From from an external perspective

1835
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,624
Real shity to her online

1836
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:01,024
I definitely believe she deserves any sort of

1837
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,352
Anyone deserves

1838
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:08,704
Targeted harassment of any believe that she's probably been the recipient

1839
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:12,032
Alex

1840
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:14,080
Have been the target of

1841
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,616
Eunice.

1842
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:17,664
I would argue that a large portion

1843
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,224
Did she get probably get

1844
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,504
They come from

1845
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,648
But

1846
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,672
Larger

1847
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,952
And much more

1848
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:30,720
Important

1849
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:33,792
Do ruined life portion of it

1850
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,584
Comes from her work

1851
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:39,168
How dare you consequences

1852
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,776
Disenfranchised communities for a long time

1853
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,568
It dishonest duplicitous

1854
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:52,736
This is the end result of a hustle gone bad

1855
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,760
Speaks for itself

1856
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,552
And the word that its peak

1857
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,320
For itself

1858
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,112
We did a great job.

1859
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:02,720
Keep on

1860
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,536
Have you ever seen your own videos

1861
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,376
Like there was a time when the

1862
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,424
Could come too

1863
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:20,128
Or you can grow a mustache

1864
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,176
Now in the days of

1865
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,016
Add social media

1866
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,576
You are screwed

1867
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:32,928
In a lot of ways because she is 25

1868
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:37,792
If we go back to the first time we ever talked about her on the podcast

1869
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:44,192
I remember you saying

1870
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:46,496
Young

1871
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:49,312
She doesn't know the cot like the end result

1872
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,336
So what she's doing

1873
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,128
I think I also said that I don't

1874
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:52,896
Pictures very good at this

1875
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:59,552
I still empathize with her because she does have a long life ahead of her

1876
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,088
And it is

1877
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,368
It's gotta suck

1878
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,928
To have your con blow up

1879
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,488
Like this got to be terrible

1880
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,768
And I emphasize

1881
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,792
Entirely

1882
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,584
But I would be bored

1883
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
Empathetic

1884
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:16,704
If she took some ownership of how what she has done

1885
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728
Has caused

1886
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,800
Suzanne

1887
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:23,616
It really feels like she's blaming everybody else for

1888
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,384
For the situation

1889
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,152
She's in

1890
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:27,200
And it makes it a lot harder for me

1891
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:33,600
To feel bad all of this focus on

1892
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:36,416
When I was over at Jack's house

1893
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,696
It makes it hard for me

1894
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,232
This is an anyway

1895
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,280
An actual breakdown of mint

1896
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,560
As it is

1897
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,352
I'm at the end

1898
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
Is this rope

1899
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:47,424
This end the end of the scam

1900
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Edit

1901
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,984
The Comedown isn't good

1902
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,800
And I'm really fun for a bit right now

1903
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:55,360
The next morning I haven't slept

1904
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,152
F*** my bones

1905
01:54:57,408 --> 01:55:00,480
And she's not famous enough to have

1906
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:07,392
Redemption

1907

Stories recently option Story by the time she would have hurt

1908
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:16,352
Lexcorp

1909
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,888
Even further.

1910
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
Complaining about how everyone

1911
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
Has ruined her life

1912
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,400
Go away with me

1913
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:57,824
We're standing up

1914
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:10,880
Yeah I bet you didn't know that

1915
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:15,232
So your face and ice

1916
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,000
Listen to

1917
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,792
It's uncomfortable to listen

1918
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,560
2

1919
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,584
Someone

1920
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:27,776
This is uncomfortable

1921
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:30,848
Experiencing a Tesla

1922
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,408
Important

1923
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,968
Still discomfort

1924
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
1

1925
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,064
Is the scam

1926
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:40,832
Fizzling out

1927
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:47,232
When someone is at the end of their rope what they do is yell about how the people within the movement

1928
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:50,304
And everybody else isn't supporting them and they need to send the money

1929
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,864
Instead of run

1930
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:55,424
I guess I'm going to lay low for a year

1931
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:59,520
And then come back as Lauren Luna something like that

1932
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,312
It's the bitter this

1933
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,592
The anger of

1934
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,896
Recognizing without accepting

1935
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,688
That you are at the end of the

1936
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:07,456
The con

1937
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,736
And I think there's something interesting

1938
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,016
I meant

1939
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,576
It's super interesting

1940
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,856
To see how little Alex give the

1941
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,512
Empathic way is not recognizing

1942
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:21,280
That what she

1943
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:23,840
She's expressing is on sublevel rejection

1944
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:26,144
It's her feeling like

1945
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:30,240
Like Alex are rejecting her

1946
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:34,592
You're not on Twitter

1947
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:39,200
What she's expressing also or maybe mostly

1948
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:41,248
Is the Betrayal of

1949
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,784
What she thought were the people

1950
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:47,136
Ulta

1951
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:49,184
Something along the

1952
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:54,048
I have to be in there because

1953
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:57,888
Was because of all the support positive feedback

1954
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:04,288
Young reporters out there you're getting the truth

1955
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:06,080
We Believe

1956
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:10,176
I don't know if Alex is

1957
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,760
These days

1958
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,552
What

1959
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,576
He comes to Alex

1960
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:17,600
Alex

1961
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:18,624
You get here

1962
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:21,696
A complete lack of care

1963
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:25,792
President

1964
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,376
I don't like

1965
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,912
Find it interesting that it isn't

1966
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:35,008
With the day before Whitley and was on it being like

1967
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,800
How to build up this thing

1968
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:37,824
Can take care of you

1969
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:40,128
Distance

1970
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,176
Response

1971
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,456
Alex's bulshit

1972
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:46,272
It's by Alex's Lac

1973
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,832
Laura

1974
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,880
Some kind of

1975
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:53,184
Like we're going to get through this

1976
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,208
You know hey

1977
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:55,232
I know it feels dark

1978
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:58,048
Are you giving a little bit

1979
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,328
And that is

1980
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,608
Suck it up

1981
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,144
Nightcore

1982
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,192
Suck it up

1983
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:08,032
Alex brings up that the president is tweeted

1984
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,056
To feel great about that

1985
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,336
As a soldier

1986
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:01,792
Qatar

1987
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:04,096
That was that almost sounds like

1988
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,120
He caught her

1989
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,400
Audio off

1990
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,192
So we could finish things

1991
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:11,264
I don't know

1992
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,568
She's embody there is

1993
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
What you were talking about

1994
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:22,016
And I started my reputation

1995
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,552
Agree I deserve

1996
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,232
Your own principles

1997
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,000
RV

1998
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,792
Very very contradicting

1999
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,816
Your

2000
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:38,400
What you feel you're entitled to

2001
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,216
These folks

2002
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:47,616
My friend Lord

2003
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:50,432
Soul

2004
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:55,296
I know you have degrees

2005
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:56,576
She might

2006
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:00,928
Laura Loomer graduated from Barry University

2007
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:05,536
If you check bear University's website you'll find that they don't offer a journalism program

2008
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:08,096
She could have received a degree in advertise

2009
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,888
In broadcast

2010
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:12,704
In communication and media

2011
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,984
Orem Public Relation

2012
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:17,056
But the best

2013
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,336
The best

2014
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:21,408
She could have received in terms of an actual journalism education

2015
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,456
Is it have a minor in journalism

2016
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,992
Which Berry does offer

2017
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:29,600
The only three times that the word journalism

2018
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,880
Barry University

2019
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:34,464
These Pages available undergraduate is in the description

2020
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,536
Locations program

2021
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,328
Are kind of related to journal

2022
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:44,960
She apparently I might have also attended Mount Holyoke College

2023
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:50,592
At some point I'm not sure I've seen that on a couple website but I don't know if that's a hundred percent true

2024
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:55,968
What school does have a journalism program journalism program that they run is an in

2025
02:01:56,224 --> 02:02:02,368
Independent study program

2026
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:04,928
If you did or not she didn't graduate

2027
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:10,816
Grandpa her to be at the top of her classes

2028
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:11,584
Did you graduate

2029
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:12,864
Trump

2030
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:17,216
Also wasn't college she was already working with project veritas

2031
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:20,544
Which I studied journalism probably would be adverse to

2032
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,312
To doing

2033
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:27,968
Proaxis group

2034
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,504
She went around

2035
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,272
And talked

2036
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:33,600
Two professors at the school

2037
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:41,280
Because of that stunt she was suspended from the school and one of the professors

2038
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:43,840
Sushi filled without permission filed a criminal complaint

2039
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,656
It should never taking any real journalism

2040
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:49,216
Classes

2041
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,240
But you didn't

2042
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:54,080
I wonder why they she's not getting

2043
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,872
Offers of like others

2044
02:02:56,384 --> 02:03:01,248
Writing a Blog

2045
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,528
Salmon on

Periscope

2047
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,344
Seems like she has

2048
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,952
Like my entire conviction

2049
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:10,720
Is

2050
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:12,000
The immediate

2051
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,536
He is so important

2052
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
Vehicle

2053
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,584
In the same way is it

2054
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,120
After

2055
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:20,704

Places like Infowars

2058
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:24,800
These Outlets

2059
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,336
To get their spin out

2060
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:28,384
Because

2061
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,200
Concrete is still drying

2062
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,016
Once it dries

2063
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,552
It's

2064
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,600

Could do that being taken away is

2073
02:03:57,312 --> 02:04:00,128
It's devastating to her being able to run this hustle

2074
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:07,296
That's all I hear is a recognition that without

2075
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,064
These tools

2076
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,832

Do I can't distract people

02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,672
I can't trick them the way that I could

2079
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:14,208
And

2080
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:16,768
As the sun sets on that scam

2081
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,304
The recognized

2082
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,912
Careers that I

2083
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,496
And do one

2084
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,288

The other thing with Laura so is she selfish

2094
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:55,680
Forgettable

2095
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:57,984
In the way

Tell that

2097
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,824
Hey

2098
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,640
Pro-immigration Isis or whatever it is

2099
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:06,688
Exhausting

2100
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:07,712
Forgettable

2101
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,600
Completely forgotten what

2102
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:22,560
Immediate requirements

2103
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:24,608
Always reminding you

2104
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:31,264
Empathize

2105
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:32,288
With

2106
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,312
The consequences

2107
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,872
Your career catching up with

2108
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:38,688
The freak out that you're seeing is

2109
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:39,968
Is there

2110
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:40,992
Kind of real

2111
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,064
Something that I

2112
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,600
I don't want

2113
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,368
To belittle

2114
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:51,744
But so much of it is

2115
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:58,144
I don't have a money stream anymore cuz my spam is ruined

2116
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,192
You know she's basically being

2117
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,520
From her position as

2118
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,056
Yeah it's a little different

2119
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:08,640
The functional

2120
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:10,176
Little different

2121
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,968
I get Wyatt

2122
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,016
You're not meet me halfway

2123
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,088
Text web

2124
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:20,160
Laura says Summit Fair Lakes

2125
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:51,136
Disgusting

2126
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:55,744
Really f****** hard

2127
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:02,144
To feel bad for anybody after that it's much like she's talked about how

2128
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,448
Worth living without social media before we

2129
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:06,496
Pretty scary I just use my friend

2130
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,288
Yeah I would definitely be

2131
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
Much more like

2132
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,848
Hey Laura

2133
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,152
We need to talk about this you need to go talk to

2134
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:14,688
She should learn how to garden

2135
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:17,248
Sure Alex should be recommended

2136
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,160
In terms of what I want

2137
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,440
Text Bono's in what I wanted

2138
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:26,208
Point out like

2139
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:27,488
She's clearly lying

2140
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:29,536
This is all just about her scam blowing up

2141
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:35,680
It's difficult as an external Observer to really know exactly what's going on

2142
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:36,704
You know like

2143
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,520
I recognize that there's a decent chance

2144
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:42,080
She does feel like her life's not worth living

2145
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:42,848
Without the

2146
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,896
Notoriety

2147
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:45,664
Celebrity

2148
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,688
Cash flow

2149
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:48,480
The social media offers her

2150
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,528
Because it's much easier than doing real work

2151
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,344
I recognize that there's a possibility

2152
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:55,904
He does feel that way and it is

2153
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:56,928
A real Mensch

2154
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:57,696
Philhealth issue

2155
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,000
At the same time

2156
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:01,792
I also recognize

2157
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:02,816
That she

2158
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:03,584
You suck

2159
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:04,608
She's terrible

2160
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,656
She says really f***** up things

2161
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:07,680
It is

2162
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,216
Equally possible that she

2163
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:10,240
Saying that

2164
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:11,776
To make people

2165
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:16,896
Think that this is an extreme situation and they should rush to her Aid

2166
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:17,920
I don't

2167
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,456
I don't know

2168
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,992
If it's sincere than

2169
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,784
I hope she gets help

2170
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,064
And I would not balk

2171
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,088
Someone actually

2172
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:25,856
We struggling with

2173
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:29,440
When you hear someone appear on Infowars

2174
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:33,536
And make it so much about how like no one supporting me everybody needs

2175
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,072
Give me money so I can do this b*******

2176
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:38,656
Lawsuit against demonized

2177
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,936
Because they're Muslims in

2178
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:41,216
Decided that they're terrorists

2179
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:45,056
And then she ends with like I don't want to live

2180
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:48,640
After my life because I have to work

2181
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,688
I find it hard to label it

2182
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:59,136
Maybe that's

2183
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:02,976
This is coming in

2184
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:06,048
And I'm not able to empathize with her

2185
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:09,376
The way that I would be

2186
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:16,032
Actually

2187
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,896
Time and effort

2188
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:22,432
Truly empathizing in

2189
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:25,760
Figure out

2190
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:28,320
Performance

2191
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,184
But yeah

2192
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,488
All signs of Alzheimer's

2193
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,536
Got off the phone

2194
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,560
And

2195
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:41,632
Chip Pierce Morgan and said we did a great job today

2196
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:44,704
Sure

2197
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,472
No

2198
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:47,776
Is there is a mental illness

2199
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,568
Text to do what

2200
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,104
How much

2201
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:52,128
Should we

2202
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,944
Calculate that into our system

2203
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:58,528
I do think it appropriate to empathize with the

2204
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,808
Struggles that people go through

2205
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:00,832
Even if their mans

2206
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,648
You know you shouldn't mock somebody

2207
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,440
For human struggle

2208
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:06,720
Even if like

2209
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,256
If there's someone that you

2210
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:10,816
Does bad thing

2211
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,096
But

2212
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:13,888
Mental illnesses

2213
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:16,448
Who's leading Alex Laura Loomer to go down these roads

2214
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,240
Evicted

2215
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:20,800
Unapologetically

2216
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:22,080
And don't seem to give a

2217
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:25,664
How much

2218
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,944
Are we required

2219
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:29,504
Yeah I struggle with that

2220
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:32,832
Good job of not making

2221
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,624
Fun of this breakdown that you

2222
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,672
She's had a kind of discussing it

2223
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:38,976
Maybe we've gone too far

2224
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:39,744
Too much credit

2225
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:43,072
But I don't think

2226
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,376
Feel ugly

2227
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,144
If we

2228
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:53,824
I don't know

2229
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:55,360
It doesn't

2230
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,736
Mentally ill so much as

2231
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:02,016
Somewhat reasonable

2232
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:05,088
What's actually going on

2233
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:10,976
It's probably how I feel

2234
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:12,256
That myself if I were on

2235
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,024
Infowars

2236
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:15,328
Like

2237
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,352
Kind of does

2238
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,912
Cuz yeah yeah

2239
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:30,688
Help my scam

2240
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,272
It's a Hail Mary

2241
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:35,552
It could be a Hail Mary

2242
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,344
Situation

2243
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:41,952
Just say you will see

2244
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:49,632
Hello Birds

2245
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:50,400
I guess

2246
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:52,960
I had to put a button on those I would say

2247
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:55,520
Don't care that

2248
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,640
Fair care more about is

2249
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:03,456
Job

2250
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,504
Caring about someone who is

2251
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:07,040
Coworker

2252
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:08,832
More.

2253
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,880
The fight

2254
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:12,672
Atopica

2255
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:18,816
And ended with some old dude

2256
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:20,608
Who's telling you the story about house

2257
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:23,936
Oh yeah I lost my job and then my wife

2258
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:26,752
My daughter she's got

2259
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:28,288
Some health issues right now I got to

2260
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,312
Help her with some bags

2261
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,872
And it's all because of the Jews and you like

2262
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:39,808
All right with the Jews did that part I wouldn't have cared

2263
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:45,440
So in this last collect from the Raiders

2264
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:48,768
I just think Alex is a really bad job

2265
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:50,816
Supposed to be like

2266
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:51,840
Keep your chin up

2267
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:53,376
Which is just

2268
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,168
It's just also

2269
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,960
Such a bad job

2270
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:03,616
We got

2271
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:10,784
Conscience

2272
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:22,816
It's always for the dawn Laura

2273
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:23,584
Bless you

2274
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,400
Glamour.com

2275
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:33,056
So you heard her say something

2276
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,848
Steamrolling through the

2277
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:38,176
We got to go to Commercial Sound boilerplate

2278
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:40,736

We'll see

2283
02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,936
How effective is

2284
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:00,704
Could not be

2285
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,728
Shut up.

2286
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,568
How to spell he's been kicked off in

2287
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:10,688
Next clip I think he recognizes that

2288
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,712
He's Cried Wolf

2289
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:12,480
Way to

2290
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:16,832
Superman Cam

2291
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:21,696
He's a real quick

2292
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:22,976
Superbad

2293
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,768
He's talking about Saudi

2294
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,304
Today

2295
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,888
Superman Cam

2296
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:35,008
Squishy Mash'Ems

2297
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:42,944
Godzilla

2298
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:47,552
Flopping around

2299
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:53,696
Gut

2300
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:02,912
Yeah

2301
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:04,704
Cuz Alex

2302
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,984
She's also invented

2303
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:13,408
This is still on the same as Broad

2304
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:19,808
Which probably made Alex want to get rid of her sooner

2305
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:26,208
Express that Rodger was taking up too much of a donation

2306
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:31,584
Summer coming on your show and just being the like percent of my income is gone

2307
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,888
8 degrees

2308
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,704
Person

2309
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,472
To be six

2310
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,496
Spillane

2311
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,520
Journalism

2312
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:42,592
He doesn't want that come again cuz that could slice an awesome

2313
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:46,176
Little pissed off about that

2314
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,760
More fundraising

2315
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:54,112
Whenever I tell people that we cuz we're

2316
02:15:54,624 --> 02:16:00,768
We're not seeing that all probably because I've said this repeatedly

2317
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:06,400
A seriously I never disappear and none of the things I say are going to happen to end up happening

2318
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:08,704
Diminishing returns

2319
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,240
As we talked about so much

2320
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:13,568
People get into him then naturally leave

2321
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:15,872
Some people stay a lot of people lie

2322
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,920
What's been disrupted is in

2323
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:19,200
Flow that replaces

2324
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:19,968
The outflow

2325
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,016
As that happens of course

2326
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:23,552
People hoard sticking around

2327
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:25,600
Can only be squeezed so much

2328
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,136
So if he doesn't see

2329
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:28,416
Spy kits

2330
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:29,952
Because the people who

2331
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,488
There's left

2332
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,512
Flow coming in

2333
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:35,072
There aren't enough people to do

2334
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,352
It's just

2335
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:38,144
The natural reality

2336
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:38,912
So

2337
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:40,960
If that's the effect of these bands

2338
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:44,288
Then I think it's good because it will end up

2339
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,824
Cutting off that

2340
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,592
Flow

2341
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:47,360
American Pie

2342
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:48,896
That'll do it

2343
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:51,968
Anything else

2344
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:53,760
Getting getting rid of the people who

2345
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:54,528
Find him

2346
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:56,064
It will be

2347
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:56,832
So much better

2348
02:16:58,112 --> 02:17:00,160
Getting up getting rid of the recruitment

2349
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:02,464
Indoctrination

2350
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,256
Part of the pipeline is very

2351
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:08,608
I know enough for listened to enough of this dude

2352
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,424
He talks all the time about like

2353
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:14,752
The money goes away I'll be in the garage doing this

2354
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,800
He absolutely won't

2355
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:21,408
Part of like I have millions

2356
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:23,456
Dollars I will just go have a ranch

2357
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:26,784
That's with my family

2358
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:28,576
The idea of like I'm going to get

2359
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,112
Continue fighting the globalist in a bucket

2360
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:30,880
Garage

2361
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,648
No you're not

2362
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,952
So like

2363
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:35,744
Cash flow from new Folk

2364
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,536
I think it's crucially

2365
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:39,072
Important

2366
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,608
Because

2367
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,632
It does

2368
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:42,400
Seem like

2369
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:52,640
Shmoney

2370
02:17:57,248 --> 02:18:00,320
Need you to support me

2371
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,904
Needs it now

2372
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,184
Needs our money

2373
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:09,280
Eclipse

2374
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,816
I have one more clip

2375
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,864
Alex's lawyer is on

2376
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,144
For a large portion

2377
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,192
Everybody Barnes

2378
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:19,520
Alright

2379
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:22,336
This is Barnes

2380
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:32,320
Alex has a Gaston who's bringing back the publication human event

2381
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:33,344
Oh

2382
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:38,720
I started the world

2383
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:39,744
Alex says

2384
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:44,096
When he was in high school you read publication

2385
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:45,120
Human events

2386
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,144
I believe it started

2387
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,912
Publishing and

2388
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,704
1844

2389
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,264
Disappeared

2390
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,288
Not too long ago

2391
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,312
Brought back by

2392
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:54,848
This guy who's a part of UK

2393
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:03,040
His lawyer saying

2394
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:06,624
Reasons why

2395
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,440
Publication headache

2396
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:10,976
It seemed to at least

2397
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:12,000
Provision

2398
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:17,888
Position it was started in 1944 with decidedly

2399
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:23,520
We should have I don't know exactly but I think

2400
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,848
Pretend you're naive about the Vichy French

2401
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:28,128
It's a little weird

2402
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:30,176
I also

2403
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:33,504
Supportive of apartheid in South Africa

2404
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:36,832
Calling pro-western bulwark

2405
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:43,232
Everybody

2406
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:44,512
Rewards

2407
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:46,560
Here's some of the winners that Alex

2408
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:47,584
Probably have some issues

2409
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,352
Use with the getting

2410
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,888
Some kind of an award

2411
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:53,728
Long list

2412
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:01,152
2000w bush

2413
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:02,944
2002 John Ashcroft

2414
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:05,760
2009

2415
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:06,528
2011

2416
02:20:06,784 --> 02:20:07,296
Paul Ryan

2417
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:15,744
The guy who recorded

2418
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:20,352
It's just stupid I don't understand why his lawyer is

2419
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:23,936
Involved with that was the part that's very weird

2420
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:26,752
They were at least supportive

2421
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:27,520
The Vichy French

2422
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,544
1949

2423
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:32,384
So we come to the end and

2424
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,152
The thing is

2425
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,432
Also

2426
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:35,968
Good work

2427
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:39,040
Great work

2428
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:42,112
I think the important

2429
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,648
Is

2430
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:46,208
You know

2431
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:52,352
Simplistic

2432
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:54,656
Sick of you on it

2433
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:55,680
Galaxy kicked off

2434
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:56,448
These things

2435
02:20:59,264 --> 02:20:59,776
That's fine

2436
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:03,872
You know I think if people want to just have the perception that he got kicked off for

2437
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:08,992
That's pretty accurate

2438
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,016
To look at these

2439
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:12,320
Because Alex

2440
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,112
What's the what's going on

2441
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:15,648
He accidentally reveals

2442
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,416
Pretty much

2443
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:17,184
Most of the

2444
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:18,208
The stop

2445
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,512
And when you look at this it's clear

2446
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:21,280
Given a chance

2447
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:22,816
Abandon

2448
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,888
Because it reinforces that message

2449
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:30,240
With it the same

2450
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,520
Campbell Boomers run

2451
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:33,056
With her pretending the

2452
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:34,080
She's going to sue Care

2453
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:36,896
Alex could do the same thing with businessinsider

2454
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,200
Aldi's

2455
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:39,968
These fake lost

2456
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:42,272
You bring in tons of money

2457
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,808
People by pretending

2458
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:44,832
But you'll be there

2459
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:45,856
And fight therefore

2460
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,696
But in reality you're probably just pocketing it or using it

2461
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:51,744
Fight the lawsuits

2462
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,304
About

2463
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:56,096
I don't know

2464
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:58,144
Yoda bulshit

2465
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,800
Kick-off whatever platform

2466
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:05,568
Decide tu

2467
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:09,152
I would stop short of calling on a

2468
02:22:09,408 --> 02:22:09,920
Anybody to Kik

2469
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:12,736
Choice

2470
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:14,784
And I think history will show

2471
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,320
It's the right to fish

2472
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:20,672
Steve the towing the line

2473
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,440
McLendon

2474
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:23,744
Like outright violence

2475
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,512
See the Wild Wings

2476
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:27,072
Express tan advocated for towards
