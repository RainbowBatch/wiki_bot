00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Have you ever

7
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
They were not necessarily but

8
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
Stick out 1

9
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,584
The old buddy make Burrows

10
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984
Who was picked over Michael Jordan

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
The NBA draft I have got it in my head

12
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,784
Is it correct

13
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,672
So short

14
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512

Hispanic architecture

19
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
Lot of history is Uno's a lot

20
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
As he was getting almost

21
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Call Aziz

22
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:44,096
Questions right then there was a question about the book The Picture of Dorian Gray

23
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
Okay

24
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,640
Picture of Dorian Gray

25
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Vindicated on that

26
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,552
Yeah that was a big

27
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
Picture

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
A lot about Oscar Wilde books

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
I know the name of one of them

30
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Exactly

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Present day

32
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Cover a number of episodes but there's no real reason to

33
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
2019

34
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
Which is last Friday's

35
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,368
Episode

36
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
I think he's hungover from the Trump rally

37
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
He's probably

38
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Sipping a few wow

39
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Didn't

40
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,520
Sleep or something I don't know use in a f*****-up space

41
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
A retelling of

42
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,808
Popular Baton Rouge

43
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,928
Brings me great joy

44
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,536

45
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
You're now a policy wonk

46
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,935
Jon Snow age

47
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983

00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
I'm a policy wonk

55
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,335

New York knickerbockers

58
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
We appreciate it very much

59
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
Got in touch with me

60
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,071
Canyons I wanted me to say thank you on Monday because your birthday was over the weekend

61
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,423
Completely fuk that up super distracted by

62
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,775
The bobbing

63
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Me and Jordan were going to harmonize we're going to be happy birthday

64
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,759

65
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
Terrible idea o.

66
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,255
Jordan 12

67
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
Alright

68
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
Happy birthday to you

69
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
We have to take

70
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,551
Technological issues

71
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
On the show in the past

72
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
Computer glitches and what-have-you

73
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
And somebody noticed that

74
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,071
They were so beyond

75
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,935
Incredibles

76
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Technological problems

77
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:39,359
Recognize

78
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
Show our appreciation

79
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Synonyms

80
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,319
When there's only one nothing that we can do that is bestowed

81
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Title

82
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
Technocrats Raptor princesses

83
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Actually created their own title

84
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
A very special drop

85
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
For them so Christy

86
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Thank you so much

87
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
You are now officially

88
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,543
The black dragon

89
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
Stupid

90
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,399
The black dragon Queen

91
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Do not

92
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Please do not

93
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,567
But thank you very much we appreciate your help.

94
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
It means a lot

95
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
To October

96
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
Riches

97
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,343
Episode that I'm super excited

98
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
It's weird

99
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Kind of

100
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
Getting more mad with Trump

101
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
Joel skousen on

102
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,423
Or more regularly

103
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
Idiot

104
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
Eviction Trump is giving lip service

105
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Communist

106
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Weird extreme right-wingers

107
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
John Birch types

108
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Intubate

109
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
Is too stupid to understand the geopolitical situation

110
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
That's skousen

111
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Right

112
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,023
Get music if he was actually smart and do what to do

113
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
April 1st

114
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
I think that's

115
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
We see that Alex is Hedge

116
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
He's trying to have

117
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
A little bit of what he's doing

118
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
Accommodate possibility of

119
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:53,247
We here

120
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
And Alex's

121
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Freestyle rhetoric

122
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Relic

123
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Control

124
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
Everything

125
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,831
So you got him here saying

126
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
Uno's

127
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,863
Yeah it does feel that way

128
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Heir of light

129
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,263
He requested that if he's going to give us pizza. Trump

130
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Possible

131
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
I think

132
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,551
Is interesting because I feel like a lot more Republicans are having their disillusionment with Trump

133
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
Moment the same way we did with Obama words

134
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
You were this thing and you're doing this

135
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Vista

136
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Universal

137
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Is that you know the

138
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
Stuff like that qanon

139
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
Reality doesn't match up with

140
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,319
Three stories that I've been telling

141
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
Work this

142
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Scam that I'm doing

143
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
I thought I thought

144
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
At least

145
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Create an approximation

146
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Reality

147
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
The stories that I'm telling right

148
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Hammer it in

149
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,751
No I'm not getting the results that I

150
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
That I like

151
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
He's our hero

152
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
I just

153
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
Start with j

154
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Really again

155
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Some thoughts about

156
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,647
The first whistleblowers as whistleblowers a hug

157
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
You can smell

158
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Oh that's why

159
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,383
You can smell the

160
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
For more explanation for what.

161
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,039
I just made the globalist

162
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
That's what he's trying

163
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
Not good

164
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
The transcripts

165
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Aviato defense

166
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Sing All We Are

167
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Don't know what I do

168
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
But if you want of my failures as a Critic

169
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Love how Alex

170
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Says

171
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
I really find it disgusting

172
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,471
Is that is the career

173
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,055
He's done one good thing in his is broadcast

174
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
To do that

175
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Mispronounce

176
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:46,367
It's up mispronouncing it's over for now

177
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
Jordan early on

178
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Classic

179
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Folktale

180
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,119
No

181
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
America

182
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
I think so

183
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,055
I think so it might have The Brothers Grimm history behind I don't know

184
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Let this play Alex

185
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:15,039
This is where I started to think he might be hungover for long pauses

186
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,623
To figure out what to do everything

187
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
McGruff

188
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Distance

189
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
Right

190
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
I think he starts by trying to

191
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Tell the normal

192
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Story of The Three Little Pigs

193
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
Atlantic gets into like maybe a sequel

194
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
Really figured out this whole racism problem

195
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
No it's just

196
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
The system looks

197
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
Facade

198
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Talk about the country

199

Lesson of The Three Little Pigs

216
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,751
Talking about how the

217
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,335
Who has allowed

218
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,943
And feed it if they're babies

219
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
For allowing him to treat them like this

220
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
That's at the core of the pigs

221
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
For not being strong enough to stand up to her

222
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Rihanna higher

223
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Thinking he's a wolf

224
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
He says you know what

225
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,439
I really hate your guts.

226
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,863
I'm going to slowly Tear You Inside Out

227
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,263
Little Pigs

Forza be over for the walls real quick

230
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
This would be going

00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,167
People think have any Elam Alex gets mad

233
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,543
When there's not enough men to stand up I guess it's true

00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
Nero Wolfe

235
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
I just want all of you out there

Intersex

237
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:34,527
I love the idea that a child

238
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
That banana

239
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Call The Wolf

240
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,535
It reminds me so much of a Patton Oswalt bit about being a

241
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
You're afraid he'll do Alice

242
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
In front of his daughter and Opie

243
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
Let me tell you the real story about

244
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,823
Now the green pieces

245
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
For you but

246
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Bright

247
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
It's toasty

248
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Traditional

249
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
This is stupid

250
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,111
Navel gazing

251
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:16,511
Also Alex is completely unhinged

252
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
For the story of The Three Little Pigs and a little bit from the movie American

253
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,471
In the movie Chris Kyle character gives a speech about how

254
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
The Sheep wolves and Sheepdogs

255
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,335
The normal people have no capacity for violence or

256
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
The people who can be hate others are the wolves

257
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,991
Are people who can be violent but love everyone are Sheepdogs

258
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,111
It's a reduction of people's alignments and how violence Works in society

259
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,439
That became very very popular

260
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Particularly a gun advocate

261
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
Basically they use it as a way to frame their need for gun

262
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,887
It's so they can be sheep dogs that protect all the rest of the

263
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
Like the wolves

264
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
Bright little pixel feet at their baby

265
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
Because it's sort of tracks with

266
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,855
Theme of that whole retelling of The Three Little Pigs

267
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
But

268
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,208
That's a book

269
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:22,816
Called written in 2004 by Colonel David Grossman

270
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,656
And it's a complete pile pile of violence Justified

271
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
It's

272
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
That sounds right

273
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,752
Honestly what I was looking for this I was worried for Alex

274
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
As this episode is getting going

275
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
You sound completely f***** up

276
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,456
He's indicating the Trump isn't going to say about that

277
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,784
Of this folktale

278
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
Somewhat Trisha anybody who cares about him at all like

279
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
If he's acting like this

280
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,928
You got a you got to go

281
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't know if it's

282
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
You're you're a lunatic

283
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,960
I really have a hard time believing that that is actually broadcast

284
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
That is so

285
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
How could you listen to that be like

286
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Well this guy's okay

287
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah right

288
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:20,160
I understand everything good like

289
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
You make excuses like

290
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
Yeah lucky

291
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:29,120
Struggles out there but we got another boat it's a great job

292
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
You got to stop kidding yourself this is

293
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
The ships going to come in

294
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,920
Further downward

295
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,272
Anybody cared about him in his life they would step

296
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,600
You know this keeps going further down

297
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,184
Like all of a sudden it's six bucks

298
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,472
Never Letting you back on never happened

299
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,616
I just I don't know really check

300
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
Indicating

301
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,968
Like pretty regular breaks with reality

302
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,832
Or actually since and how many are just like him talkingshit

303
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:27,232
It's really hard to say he's a man who's living

304
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
You having it

305
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Difficult time

306
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,864
Differentiating between reality

307
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
Illusions

308
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,008
I asked pretty well transmitted in this neck

309
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
Text clip he's talking about how people who

310
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
Politically disagree with them

311
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
Excited

312
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,712
Evil

313
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,320
As they become an empty vessel the demons just can jump into liking the maitre

314
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
I can't disprove that

315
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Okay

316
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,536
So I think I would like a little bit more from him on why

317
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
I'm looking for

318
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,144
Here's what he has to say

319
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
BL

320
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
What is that

321
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Is the devil

322
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Spoiler

323
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
From the Devil

324
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,240
What

325
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
First time I saw it

326
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,168
Edward goes into jumpsuit

327
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
Jump jump

328
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,992
Presbyterian

329
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
What is the

330
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
What the f***

331
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Like

332
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480
He's talked about this sort of thing repeatedly it's not

333
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,368
Grocery stores around here

334
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
If he actually has experience go to a hospital

335
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
Eddie he's lying about it

336
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,984
Then what he's doing is normalizing

337
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,336
The experience might have if they're having a break with reality

338
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
He said no no it's real

339
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
What's a Euro listener who's list

340
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm going to shower and maybe you're experiencing something like that you're having loose

341
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,832
Auditory or visual or whatever

342
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
Alex is like that's demons

343
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,208
Mission from another

344
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:43,584
Are you going to take me probably go get my meds checked out or I should go get help

345
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,888
You're going to be around me

346
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:50,240
I better do something

347
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,664
Normalize

348
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Destructive

349
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
Sort of dangerous side effects

350
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
Set timer

351
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
Even if

352
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Who Alex

353
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Turns into proof of his

354
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Conspiracies

355
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
Feel like these symptoms are proof of this

356
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,816
Even if they don't

357
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,632
Commit like violence

358
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
Keeping them

359
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
From getting the help

360
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
It's still hurting

361
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,384
But even that they don't act out against

362
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Now determined to be demon

363
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
Sure it's still

364
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Alex's

365
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Severely hurting

366
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
And I don't know which of those I think is worth

367
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,232
Which option or just talking s***

368
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
Normalizes

369
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,816
Normalizes the right word

370
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
I think

371
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Giselle

372
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
I think.

373
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah

374
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Actually

375
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,968
Very serious

376
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,016
And if he's not

377
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
Give me three and a half

378
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,624
Because why are you pretending

379
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,000
10:40

380
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
F*** you need help

381
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216
Episode

382
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:30,592
Yeah yeah

383
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,968
Rambling nonsense

384
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,064
Ridiculous ESO moments of flourish

385
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,120
Eating ass

386
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
That does get a license

387
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,920
In studying the Transmissions of the devil that I watch The Matrix and I was like I didn't know that was

388
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:12,320
Was real can I watch The Matrix elliptical

389
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
Matrix

390
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
Here's what happened

391
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
Check out a little while

392
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:22,560
So this clip sound

393
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,944
Economic

394
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
Ultra spiritual

395
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
Ashley Manor

396
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Much much

397
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
100 ft tall

398
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
You're going to see

399
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
Suicide

400
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
People Transit

401
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:09,920
What about the millions of nuclear reactors melted down exploding huge War starting

402
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
Linsanity

403
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,832
You think you've seen something so far

404
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
We're living in the millisecond

405
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
In our

406
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
I served under General insanity

407
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
You know

408
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,960
Most reminds me of

409
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
Charles Manson

410
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
This is

411
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:41,152
Straight out of Charles Manson it does have a similar field

412
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,504
Providing underage girls I think that's the only difference

413
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Right now I can

414
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,624
It's called leadership

415
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,744
Also uninspired and and

416
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,072
Lackadaisically delivered in LA

417
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,120
I guess I haven't listened to a ton of Charles Manson

418
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:06,240
Speeches

419
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
Realtor

420
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
That's one of the reasons why the present-day also isn't

421
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Super

422
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Compelling to me

423
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Is like

424
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
I did see somebody who'd like

425
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Someone should be helping

426
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,600
Everyone around him is negligee

427
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
For whatever reason

428
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,232
Fear of Vikings reaction

429
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,120
Terrifying

430
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
I am help like I imagined

431
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,240
Someone saying you need to go talk to somebody

432
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
But also a terrible

433
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
Are you telling me that I'm not man enough to vote

434
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
Go to work

435
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
People who care able to convince

436
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,608
Themselves just doing this for Ratings or whatever

437
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,984
I think I agree with you to like even if it's just pretend

438
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,848
That is an indication of

439
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
He's clearly wrestling wood

440
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,968
I don't know I just

441
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
He aspires to

442
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:30,208
A problem that isn't all that interesting to me that

443
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
Most of his narrative

444
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
Stuff that we could cover and discuss more interesting even have already

445
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,336
Racist

446
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
Everyone's the devil like

447
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
It leaves me searching for things like those folk tale Three Little Pigs

448
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,464
Like he's just phoning it in boring as s***

449
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,840
Three Little Pigs thing is so wild

450
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
I'm still struggling

451
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
To comprehend

452
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
When you brought it up again

453
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
Yeah but did that really happen

454
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
What what is also

455
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,760
How are you still going

456
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,928
You are rewriting it also like how he

457
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
Explain the stories

458
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
Yeah

459
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
Cuz they're at they're like really just basic

460
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:49,312
Their function

461
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
I wonder

462
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:02,880
I bet you have to drink if

463
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:08,256
The Venom the fangs of the cobra

464
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:14,656
For a little bit and then we realize that he forgot to turn off the ringer on

465
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,152
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

466
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
Cool just Rambles debate about that wow like

467
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
Complete nonsensical unhinged ridiculous

468
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
He's also

469
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,400
Forgetting to turn off his ringer before he starts

470
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,240
Now back to this

471
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
Like criticism of

472
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
At least

473
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,688
There's a story line through Alex's

474
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,992
Experience with drop

475
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
At least I

476
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,600
It turns out that Alex had some criticism

477
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
But it mostly comes

478
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
He's worried

479
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
He will summon

480
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Literally

481
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
Summoned the demon

482
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
Without knowing how to control

483
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
The rest of us

484
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Here we go

485
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
This is

486
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Further Evidence

487
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Haha

488
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
In his

489
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:14,208
Conception literally summon the demon

490
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Craft

491
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
The case of Charles Dexter Ward about what you can't breathe

492
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,680
Whatever

493
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,032
I don't

494
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,568
Properly told the story of the

495
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,616
The three little picture I'll tell you that right now

496
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:36,224
Your criticism starts it comes from

497
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Your criticism isn't coming from

498
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,064
A place you're just a lunatic

499
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,392
No I think I did read Nancy Pelosi Adams

500
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
To the articles of

501
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,512
Edina Realty

502
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,912
Copy high crime or misdemeanor

503
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Keep track of

504
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
Let me be

505
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,552
Like tears

506
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,112
It took the my intellectual Curiosities

507
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Much less

508
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:21,024
I get really excited.

509
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Because there's

510
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
There's still much too

511
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,864
How does this work

512
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:32,800
Is very simplistic

513
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
Put out

514
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
Lines on what specific

515
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Anime of seven

516
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,272
Athena I was thinking azrielle pillowtop

517
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,368
Classics Beelzebub of course

518
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Little Darkness references

519
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
Alex

520
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,200
Even though you can't put down

521
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Dumb bulshit

522
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,648
Which again

523
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Kicked off Facebook

524
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,072
And then all they do is just broadcast

525
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,576
This also is after Alex

526
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,880
Complains about

527
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
Getting a app

528
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,488
Video of what he thinks about Alex Jones

529
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
Being kicked on Facebook

530
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,584
Who's Alex Jones

531
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,984
Alex very mad about that

532
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Right side Broadcasting

533
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
Trump speech

534
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,784
Welbeck

535
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
Even though

536
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
So I assume that that's all they do

537
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
Have their own speeches on Facebook

538
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
There's a little bit right side Broadcasting

539
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,104
To conveniently leaving out of his characterization of them that would go a long way toward explaining why they might not be allowed on Facebook

540
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
In 2017 right side Broadcasting

541
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,784
Mostly known for two things

542
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
Salad

543
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,416
The first possibly recorded himself peeing in his own mouth

544
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
First. Video

545
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Specific

546
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,400
Swallow

547
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,312
Disappointed that's not what I paid to write

548
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
The second thing is known for the series of videos they made their were purported to show that black men were violent

549
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:26,880
What is egregious examples this was a video where he claimed he was setting up a camera on a car that had Trump stickers on it

550
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,696
In a black neighborhood and Justine what happened to it

551
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
Group of young black man, they destroyed

552
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:39,424
That's just how black people

553
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,776
As you can see from this video the black community is very violent

554
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Supporters

555
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,384
That video hit a million views with an H

556
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,552
Largely driven by traffic that he got from it being reposted Entourage

557
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
Unfortunately for Joey

558
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,440
Someone in the neighborhood where he was shooting this video caught some footage of Their Own

559
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,584
Namely footage of the black man waiting around kind of camera tripod delivered

560
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
The entire video

561
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,216
Design to justify Trump supporters victimization narrative

562
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
Braces

563
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,872
Nobody was taught Joey tried to make excuses

564
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,688
And he said quote I thought I could get away with it

565
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,808
This isn't even close to the Omni fake race-baiting video he's put out a complete piece of s***

566
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
And if right side Broadcasting

567
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
Consider hiring him in 2017

568
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
Which is after you get that car hope

569
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:39,328
Also side note Joey salads is currently running as a republican New York

570
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,352
11th District

571
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
Congressional

572
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,448
Key and everybody's house

573
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,592
It's not just area tuxedo

574
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,895
And it's not an isolated

575
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
They also hired Nick Fuentes

576
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
Imagine any Bo Nazi leaning

577
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:04,671
Position a person could hold all about

578
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
Of course he denies all those labels

579
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
Self is a guy who loves America

580
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
It's all about white people

581
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
Pizza terrible

582
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
The network was short because in August

583
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,591
But the Constitution doesn't apply to Muslims and immigrants

584
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,407
Globalist

585
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,551
Time to kill the globalist I don't want to go to business

586
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,927
I don't want to be more honest I want people to be arrested and deported or

587
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
That is a

588
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
Hot Tech I'm going to give him that

589
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:53,055
The network also ran shows hosted by Mike cernovich

590
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,639
Sure I forgot

591
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:04,063
Also I literally just went to their Facebook page and 270 3000

592
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,135
Those little verification verified

593
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,055
Bulshit work is

594
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:34,271
He's lying about them getting kicked off Facebook it's very publicly that it's right there

595
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Have you ever heard the phrase hat on a

596
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,135
Yes it's that it's that that's for white 6

597
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,607
So Alex the talking about

598
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
Sure are we still doing

599
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Yeah Play-Doh sets

600
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Some stuff about how

601
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
Lgbtq

602
00:43:54,495 --> 00:44:00,383
Peekyou

603
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
Have five

604
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
C3 status

605
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,391
The other part of it

606
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,207
Anyway Alex is mad about the sdlc

607
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Beto's mouth

608
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
Mouthpiece

609
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
Global Shoes

610
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
How many lies by something Trump

611
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,311
That's not it

612
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
Control

613
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:44,415
Forgot trip form

614
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,103
It's the hairy guy Specter Gadget Uncle Fester

615
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:08,223
I thought it was

616
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,807
Christopher Lloyd

617
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,463
Couple movies

618
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Got that

619
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:26,399
Essential misunderstanding that Alex has

620
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,983
Status withdrawal lay down with

621
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,615
He thinks the rules say the church's can't talk about politics or social issue

622
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,431
But that is not the rule

623
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:44,575
The amendment specifically about partisan political activity

624
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Churches against abortion

625
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,159
They can be against abortion

626
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,255
They just can't use their Church to support a specific

627
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,047
Or attack a pro-abortion

628
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,351
Or replace candidate with

629
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
Measure or whatever

630
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
Use it for political

631
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
Advocacy

632
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Strictly

633
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
Right that's the other thing

634
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,895
This isn't the rule that ever been enforced very strongly pretty much

635
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:14,783
Ever

636
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,343
I've been to a church where partisan politics have been engaged

637
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
Yep

638
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
Small instances of it or just kind of ignored by the IRS because they know that strict enforcement of this rule is way more trouble than

639
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,143
It's an important rule to be in place though so they can go after organizations

640
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
Exploit

641
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
Political machine

642
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:37,055
And that kind of thing it is important

643
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
It never enforcing it

644
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
In practice

645
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,687
Churches legitimately almost never get in trouble for Johnson

646
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,879
On May 4th 2017 Trump signed an executive order the Secretary of the Treasury really enforced by the

647
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
C3 rules

648
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,743
Which most experts agree is really just a symbolic Act

649
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,559
Pandering to his base

650
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,655
Even the ACLU said it quote had no discernible policy outcome

651
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:09,567
Of course after Trump sign the orders started running around bragging about getting rid of the Johnson Amendment

652
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
Even if you wanted to

653
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
Xeloda performative bulshit

654
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,967
It's real

655
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,319
Is it in that clip Alex

656
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
Which is dammit

657
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
State phrase

658
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,023
No I mean nothing

659
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
So

660
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,191
The wall

661
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,983
Search reality TV show

662
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
That's what we have is creating a narrative

663
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,295
Play Watchtower

664
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,719
Reality pedophilia

665
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,535
You did say that I remember

666
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,911
Sherwin

667
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,751
Until

668
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,335
So

669
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,919
I don't know why Alex would even say to that

670
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Our church

671
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
Speak out against

672
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,759
The bestiality

673
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
What

674
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
Why

675
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,159
Even Up For Debate like in the political

676
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:37,375
Partisan politics

677
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:42,239
Independence for some reason

678
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:46,591
Bring bestiality back I don't know why it needs to come back

679
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,639
I don't know why it was there in the first

680
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
Sure

681
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,247

687
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:10,655
Imagine what that would look like in the real world

688
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,263
Distraction

00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,591

691
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
Yeah

692
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,943
We talked about this or touch down a bit earlier

Zoos that sort of like

694
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,527
Disillusionment moment

695
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,647
The cloud

696
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,183
You see what you actually

697
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
These next couple of clips

698
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
Really get to the heart of that for Alec

699
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,415
Yeah

Weird

713
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
Court jester

Most

720
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
To say something

721
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
Totally legal

722
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:35,039
Well you always is that legal lawful action

723
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,671
Isaac is like Alex.

724
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
Young says that all the time

725
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
You Alex

726
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
You're now saying everyone's tired of the line that I've been feeding that

727
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
And so now I think

728
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
It's time to Pivot

729
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,127
Did you start to see

730
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,407
The early signs

731
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,479
How much is

732
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,831
This plant is it grows right I have no f****** idea

733
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
Play

734
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,695
I care about the president

735
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
Don't want to hear

736
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,687
I want to see destatis frog-marched

737
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,503
Now that's not going to happen

738
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,295
Nobody knows that

739
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,623
Freeze him to be like I put it on the line

740
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:47,231

Masculinity nonsense ideas I have you know what it didn't come through

743
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
It didn't happen

744
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
We got to save ourselves

745
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,127
02

746
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
Exactly how many icing

747
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,455
This is does Trump have up his dirty

748
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
I would say point

749
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,415
We're happy we're half to little over halfway.

750
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
That's that

751
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,071
You got to get up

752
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
Is the family show

753
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:30,239
So Alex Goes further down this road

754
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
Squatting

Do not

759
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Oh boy

00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:06,079
Lockup solidify Power by

00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:10,431
Taking out his political Rivals that Alex is determined or deep State operative so

762
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
That's good

763
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,783
Right that's healthy

764
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,575
Convince

765
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343

Fantasies

767
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,791
It's really frustrating like that that whole like her up and all of that

768
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
Your view sold them on something that is

769
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Not real

770
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,263
He's really only serve in the real world they only really serve

771
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,663
To help someone who wishes to solidify authoritarians our kuso

772
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,991
Executive Authority

773
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,903
Calling for Trump to lock up all of his imaginary deep state

774
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
Like

775
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,279
Cool by normalizing Rise of a tyrant

776
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
ND

777
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,095
Get out of it

778
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
But I guess

779
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
Emotional

780
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,447
No satisfaction of watching

781
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,751
Somebody that you've been told as evil get

782
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,079
Treated like that if you're okay

783
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,871
F*****-up be all the policy

784
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Cease that actually come

785
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:18,015
Yes if you're someone on the ground absolutely

786
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,319
Maybe the idea that I'll get back on Facebook

787
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:26,719
If we're going to have to control

788
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
Facebook production

789
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
In order for me to go

790
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Got it

791
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,583
Yeah I just want

792
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
So Alex

793
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,495
Most of the he's canceled as guest

794
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:42,591
Cancel this gift he's canceled Nick begich hosting the 4th hour

795
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
Lizzie wants to take

796
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
The calls

797
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,711
He wants calls from people who disagree with

798
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,039
If you listen to how you setting this up

799
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,111
It really strongly implies did you call in

800
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,415
And you disagree with him

801
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:02,815
And no one calls in to disagree with it because they're too afraid of having a reaction

802
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:08,191
I'll probably going to be dealt with as if I'm a demon called

803
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Real

804
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:25,599
Always and say I'm the government-run corruptor on build exercise

805
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,767
Tara from you

806
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,839
Casino

807
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:57,343
Weather

808
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,231
Disqualifies anybody

809
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Start

810
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,583
Call treat us.

811
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,679
Like telling you that is Supernatural

812
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,775
Is controlling them making them the targets of violence

813
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,359
Talk to me what's up

814
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:29,599
It's kind of just like a preamp

815
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Never having the

816
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
What

817
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,743
So Alex is mad about gender pronouns

818
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
Wanted to do

819
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,583
Known on the street

820
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Yeah

821
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:45,215
He's mad about the political correct

822
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
Missive

823
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,311
I don't know expected to

824
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:55,711
You treat people how they want to be

825
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
What about that

826
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
But the things

827
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
Uses as

828
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
Example of times

829
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
We've acquiesced

830
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,439
Do these sorts of things in the past

831
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
Indicate to me

832
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:07,999
Simbad

833
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,871
Subway

834
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,551
Alex

835
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,935
Edward was the slipper

836
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
Freak slowed

837
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,567
Because then what isn't that you want

838
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,919
Apparently illegal

839
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,295
The part that I born in

840
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:09,695
The client should be tax-exempt

841
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:16,607
Next thing you know when somebody says they want to be referred to as

842
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,887
You have to do it right

843
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:24,543
No trying to draw a parallel between

844
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,175
Authoritarian

845
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,479
Parallel to that

846
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
They took away the Clans tax

847
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,295
Exempt status

848
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,879
Church down the street

849
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:43,999
It's just against the war against the war they have their tax-exempt status taken away

850
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
Yeah it's not

851
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,863
It's not real

852
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,935
The client should have kept

853
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
Which is

854
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
Yeah

855
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
I mean

856
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
88

857
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Free speech

858
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,615
And tax-exempt status

859
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
We have to respect

860
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
I guess

861
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,927
More of this deteriorating

862
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:17,023
Descending into like being mad about

863
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,935
GQ people in general not really

864
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:30,335
Noting the difference between people who are drag performers might be

865
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:34,175
Everybody

866
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
Right

867
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Disgusting

868
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
This

869
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Combine

870
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:54,911
Always so scared now they're ready for the sexual conversion

871
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
No

872
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
In video after

873
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:13,599
Evil flows through

874
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:22,303
Touch some rides sit on them close to the spider come to me my

875
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:39,967
Okay

876
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,319
The only reason is to demonstrate

877
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,343
You spell August

878
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
Second

879
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
It's because

880
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,255
He needed to do that in order to get into that headspace

881
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,607
Headspace

882
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
And it allows

883
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,423
To transition into like

884
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,007
Just a completely f***** up weird character

885
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,823
The it's not gross

886
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,919
An incredibly fake

887
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
The Voice

888
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,479
Coming out of this

889
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,599
He's now embodied these demons

890
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,207
Get out of it

891
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,303
I don't know

892
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,703
If I were Alex instead I think he now needs to play

893
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
Play the other roll

894
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
Hero-guy

895
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,103
Don't want to talk it in my life

896
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,431
Trying to

897
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,831
I feel like you saying that means you are

898
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,327
Authoritative

899
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,167
Put somewhere back in our instincts

900
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,215
Build-A-Bear

901
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,031
What cereal

902
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,295
And it's about pronouns

903
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,695
Exercise

904
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:31,327
Notices voice my back to normal there

905
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Voices

906
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:42,079
Anyways back to the normal conversation we were having

907
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,919
I tried to look into greyback

908
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
Old greyback

909
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,807
The only thing I could find was a term for like one of the currency

910
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:57,439
Before we had like inside.

911
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
The Union Army

912
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,607
But I don't think that's Wings reference

913
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Blue

914
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,471
Don't know

915
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,567
What

916
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,687
It's got to be some

917
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:21,759
Reference to a western

918
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Don't know what

919
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,671
The case I mean lost

920
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:35,583
Doing impressions of demons and then impressions of who he wants to protect us from the demons

921
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,375
Just like a guy who's

922
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
Playing out

923
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,447
Just absurd One Man Show

924
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:45,823
It's a mentally unwell

925
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
So confused

926
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
I apologize

927
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,711
It is so

928
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,735
Utterly

929
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,039
Beyond Paradise

930
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,367
Nobody would be more Furious

931
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
Avene mist

932
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
Then

933
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,231
If you were to call him

934
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,279
Over and over and over again

935
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
It would drive me crazy

936
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,911
You know what

937
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,799
Repeat over and over again

938
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,591
Just so how is it that

939
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:25,759
That's good they're trying to attack me

940
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,063
Jersey f*** off

941
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,391
Yeah it is interesting

942
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:34,975
Incapable

943
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,423
He has to recognize and with that lunacy

944
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,447
Is the message

945
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:52,639
Also it gets geopolitical to he starts taking calls

946
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,199
And he ends up talking to

947
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,503
Who has a little bit of

948
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:01,087
A bone to pick about how a certain politician is being treated there

949
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,415
Tell me how come Canada election simulator

950
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,951
Later this month and

951
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,231
It's really incredible

952
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,767
Do we have a

953
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,559
Classical liberal

954
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:14,911
That's come onto the stage and Missy the same pattern happening

955
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
What is populist movement

956
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
It's a return to

957
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,543
No just the classical liberal roots

958
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
Yo

959
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:31,807
Talking about Maxim

960
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:38,463
Well I'll be the first but I do not know everything about political

961
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,351
It's because his party seems to have a bunch of neo-nazis and fascists in it

962
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
Alright well

963
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Okay

964
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:53,055
Find Wilshire for the People's Party to file with the Canadian elections Folk

965
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:00,735
Registration

966
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,319
Attesting that they are members of this actual political party

967
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,135
What was Sean Walker

968
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,487
Who was formerly the head of the Neo-Nazi organization

969
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:17,887
You want to know why you wasn't

970
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:24,543
Federal charges of orchestrating attacks on

971
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,895
John White Citizens in Salt Lake City between the years 2002-2003

972
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,527
87 months in prison

973
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,551
2000

974
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:42,207
250 names

975
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,279
Alright

976
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Alright

977
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
Only two strikes

978
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:59,615
Then there was Justin else remember these soldiers of Odin

979
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:04,223
A finland-based white supremacist groups

980
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,247
Vigilantes

981
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,343
Quite a long time ago

982
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,863
Which I guess is technically still before you sign the petition is member The People's Party

983
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,887
But not by very much

984
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,703
No that's why

985
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Now

986
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
I've decided to change

987
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,823
Four track

988
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:36,223
I don't care about your rules.

989
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,623
It's because he needed to find 250 party members sign a petition in a Superfecta

990
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
Subway supremacist

991
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,719
I feel like that is a bad sign

992
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Can you turn to your left

993
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
You're right there a lot of

994
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,631
He's around

995
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
You stick around

996
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,703
Yeah you're a nut

997
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,007
That's really weird

998
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:04,383
These are classical liberal

999
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,431
Classical liberal

1000
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,735
It's weird interest

1001
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:12,831
838

1002
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:19,231
And had him on the Rubin report

1003
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,047
Who do I like fundraiser

1004
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,863
Interesting

1005
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
These

1006
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:32,031
Big dogs over here

1007
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,079
Very interested in

1008
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,871
He also has

1009
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,991
Party members

1010
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
Create a

1011
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,319
Global associate

1012
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,647
Right wing

1013
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
Nationalist

1014
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
Classical liberal

1015
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,071
Control the world it makes a Global Group

1016
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,863
Madeline

1017
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
Do well

1018
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,935
Seems like a good idea

1019
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:04,799
Alex

1020
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,335
Feel like it's still time for bed

1021
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,167
Shutdown

1022
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,079
I'd like to start

1023
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,719
Park Hill Tunnel

1024
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
For Destruction

1025
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:09,311
Is totally fine the idea of trump and his family behaving like

1026
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,271
Chosen enemies globalist

1027
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,831
You can have a kingdom

1028
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:27,231
Going to me what could be more American than creating a dynasty of

1029
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,255
Fascist leaders

1030
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:32,351
Who have total political enemies

1031
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,631
Address for that power

1032
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:42,591
Logout political enemies Rivergate

1033
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:47,967
Cancel

1034
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:52,063
About absolute also

1035
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,343
Theme to wish

1036
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,367
To control

1037
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,135
Media

1038
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
Punish

1039
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:03,583
People who report

1040
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
I want

1041
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,143
My dictatorship

1042
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
I don't want

1043
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,495
My imaginary enemies

1044
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,311
A what

1045
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
Will live under this

1046
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
White tyranny

1047
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,919
Multicultural

1048
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
Revealing

1049
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,087
Find with him

1050
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
Yeah no

1051
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
I'd like

1052
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,535
Well then I'm taking my ball and going

1053
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,071
Home

1054
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,887
You think we're going to add malt

1055
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,959
That's what it's supposed

1056
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,519
To be about so I'm going to get rid of democracy

1057
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,639
How do you like that

1058
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,407
With the democracy

1059
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,063
More present

1060
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,671
To completely abandon those ideas about like Posse Comitatus

1061
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
Let him run

1062
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,279
The Damascus flip

1063
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,375
Everything else before was pretend

1064
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
Yep

1065
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,495
Identity guy

1066
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Former

1067
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,407
CIA guy who went on

1068
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,199
MSNBC or whatever

1069
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,783
Who spies are going to kill the president

1070
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,087
He was obviously talking

1071
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:29,855
Annabella Schmidt

1072
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Lights out

1073
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,559
Go to examples of people actually being like

1074
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
He's just making s*** up

1075
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,855
Sure

1076
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,159
Does it

1077
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
Jealous supporters

1078
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,647
And that's where the expression his name is mud

1079
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:42,303
This goes back to dr. Samuel injuries after the assassination

1080
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:46,399
But the jury is still out about whether or not he was in any way involved in crime

1081
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:51,519
There's a pretty high chance of not knowing

1082
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:57,919
It's unclear what he was doing

1083
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
Regardless

1084
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:03,039
His Name Is Mud is absolutely not

1085
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,599
Lincoln was assassinated in eighteen

1086
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,159
55

1087
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:08,927
Trace the

1088
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,463
Expression his name is mud

1089
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
At least as far back as 1/8

1090
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,791
23 book from Britain

1091
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
Call Daddy

1092
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,583
Canary of the turf

1093
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,631
Which includes the line

1094
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Exclusionary rule

1095
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
Spell differently

1096
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:25,823
Mud a stupid swaddling fellow

1097
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:31,967
The expression of a circle even predates

1098
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,991
Public Storage

1099
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,575
1823 long before the

1100
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
Comparison

1101
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
The pawn on it

1102
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
Mud itself is

1103
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
Linguistic

1104
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,143
As well like everybody has been like that guy is like

1105
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
I'm at the center.

1106
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,663
I'm just saying it's not necessarily.

1107
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
Sure but it wouldn't help with the mud situation

1108
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,719
This version of the story that Alex is telling about the root of this idiom

1109
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Of course

1110
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:29,311
Particular I remember the story that's told in the Book of Secrets

1111
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,871
Find Cage's character Benjamin Franklin

1112
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:37,247
Favorite very strong suspicion that that's where Alex got the story from National Treasure

1113
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,111
It's a very good Nicholas

1114
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
Performance

1115
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,159
It's very good

1116
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:51,839
I am a fan of the National Treasure movies

1117
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
The first one

1118
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,287
So many times

1119
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
Is that

1120
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:06,687
Might've worked at the theatre when it came out but I just thought it was so over-the-top and ridiculous

1121
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Dawn story

1122
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,063
Nicolas Cage is awesome

1123
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:18,463
Historical revision aspects

1124
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,583
Nicolas Cage

1125
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,935
Such a great line Book of Secrets wasn't nearly as

1126
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:32,287
Delphine

1127
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
The increase

1128
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
Parts for a WhatsApp

1129
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:42,271
And Harris was the first one

1130
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,343
Still pissed

1131
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,135
What would what would you

1132
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,951
The plot for it

1133
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,047
Clue to a treasure or something

1134
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,351
Buried in Arlington Cemetery

1135
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:02,751
In the place where presidents are buried so in order to get the clue he has to become the president and then faked his own death

1136
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
13

1137
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,103
Get buried in Arlington Cemetery to find the clue

1138
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,639
I don't know

1139
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
But it's me

1140
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
So anyway

1141
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,599
Pretty sure that that's where Alex

1142
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:21,695
He gets everything from movies

1143
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:28,095
This is absolutely not true

1144
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,887
It is in that movie

1145
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:35,519
That's where Phil Mudd being the great great great

1146
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,151
Phil's pretty private

1147
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
Available.

1148
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,455
Tree or lineage

1149
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,247
Still doesn't matter either way

1150
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:50,111
Yeah you'll hear the clamp reported over and over again on message boards and tweets but there's no sourcing

1151
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
For whatever

1152
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,671
And even if it is who cares

1153
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,231
Alex exactly zero.

1154
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,119
Confederacy

1155
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,911
Whether or not he was in on the plan

1156
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,447
You know every

1157
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,983
Jefferson Davis

1158
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,775
He's got very little yachts

1159
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,335
Strange feelings on that subject

1160
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:16,735
The bottom line here is that Alex has one hundred percent wrong

1161
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,783
Historical fiction movie

1162
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
Four treasures

1163
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,855
Did the Knights Templar hit around the world

1164
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:25,951
He's further just making up any nose is Phil Mudd is related to Samuel B cuz they have

1165
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
The same last name

1166
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,511
This is the level of shipping

1167
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,327
Everybody everybody

1168
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Sure

1169
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:43,359
Bright but he uses this idea about film

1170
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,663
In order to justify

1171
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
He thinks

1172
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,223
Gets to do now

1173
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
Chocolate

1174
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,111
How to change user

1175
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
No

1176
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:06,911
So we're starting to think about how we guard ourselves

1177
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,263
About yourself for real

1178
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,104
Parts

1179
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
Brain

1180
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Everybody tries to keep

1181
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,224
In the warehouse under

1182
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,528
Under sheets

1183
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,184
Are we around the f****** campfire right now

1184
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:29,952
Scared of

1185
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,400
Never actually did anything like that again

1186
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,896
Don't know history

1187
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,456
History

1188
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,320
Alex

1189
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:01,184
He thinks that

1190
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Okay with horses

1191
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
Is him he is worth

1192
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,656
Alex

1193
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:18,336
Earlier like Alex saying that as long as he takes out the globalist

1194
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:24,224
Great chest seems to be against literally everything you stand for

1195
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,624
Do you need

1196
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,904
All that you need

1197
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
2

1198
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
Still pay attention

1199
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
The present

1200
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,560
This verse

1201
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Some

1202
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
Very

1203
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,704
Ideas

1204
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,008
God Hates a Coward

1205
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,640
People have their way with your

1206
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,832
God damn

1207
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,416
And you're very genetic

1208
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:07,488
Playing that song underneath that

1209
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,816
Yeah it should be against the law

1210
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
No

1211
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,408
I'm going to give you a nightmarish

1212
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
I hope scape speech with

1213
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:34,368
Contacts entire world

1214
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,416
He's talking about white

1215
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
You talk about

1216
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,280
Yep like that's

1217
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
In terms of

1218
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:51,520
Danger if he doesn't start using his bully pulpit

1219
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,824
Declared national state of emergency

1220
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,528
Liars and cheaters

1221
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,648
NetSpend

1222
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,512
Entirely his life

1223
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
He's

1224
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:20,192
CreateSpace and a show in and advocate for Congress

1225
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,640
He's done such a poor job of teaching his audience

1226
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,248
Anything about the reality of the

1227
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
The Advocate

1228
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:41,440
Everything that he talks about superficial

1229
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,232
Stupid and So based on

1230
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,560
That he has just a bunch of radicalize listeners

1231
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
Pinkberry

1232
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,400
And simultaneously

1233
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,424
Congress

1234
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,496
Two arrested political line

1235
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,288
Where to go to

1236
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Secretary of

1237
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,640
Whenever somebody has said we must

1238
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,664
Destroy the Republic

1239
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,944
To save the Republic

1240
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Is it historically donwell

1241
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,272
I know that there is one

1242
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
Great

1243
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,832
Literary historical stores

1244
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:11,904
George Lucas

1245
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,720
Is George Lucas dead

1246
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,608
Wendy's has this imperative

1247
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,424
22 facts from your audio

1248
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,472
You have failed you failed miserably

1249
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,336
Lady

1250
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
Do you

1251
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
Have you

1252
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,504
If you hate America

1253
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:46,464
Really hates America

1254
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:52,352
So it is exclave Alex said something this is the closest I've ever been about to talk about us

1255
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:58,240
Stop

1256
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,744
So I thought I thought

1257
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,632
Don't know what that's about

1258
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:32,032
But by the end of the episode he hasn't made it clear what this is about but I think it's a

1259
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,360
Are coming out

1260
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,896
I may be on Netflix

1261
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
I don't know

1262
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:42,272
That might have something to do with framing Alex for causing violent

1263
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,344
Don't know he's very nice

1264
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,648
Specific about it but I think that's what it said reference

1265
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:51,232
Might be in production that might be frame

1266
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,560
Far more sense than him talking about

1267
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
What's a very real

1268
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,608
So

1269
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:04,032
Unfortunately it got my heart

1270
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
Guns are drawn

1271
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,080
But alas

1272
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,432
Dog collar

1273
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,048
This is actually happening

1274
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,096
So you got the Great Awakening language

1275
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,376
I think you did

1276
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:33,472
I might have my Enclave

1277
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:39,872
To the key phrase

1278
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:46,272
Cuz they've been in the concubines or whatever

1279
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,064
Roosevelt big

1280
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Common Man

1281
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,192
I think there could be like a Rico

1282
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
Knew that he has

1283
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,848
We sold our country

1284
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,616
The Federal Reserve

1285
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,200
Hobart

1286
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:21,600
Absolutely

1287
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:27,232
Portland

1288
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,256
You said that

1289
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,536
28000

1290
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:35,936
I don't think you use that high of a number right

1291
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
Now these things

1292
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,080
Keep talking about it and never come

1293
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,408
So Alex

1294
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Because it's a no

1295
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
Episode of the show

1296
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,552
Day of the week

1297
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,600
It doesn't stop him from talking about

1298
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,880
Please prepare to

1299
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,816
Can you turn your ringer off

1300
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:19,712
420 Club

1301
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:26,112
He in the fourth hour at this point this is the fourth hour of his show and he's going to get to the news

1302
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:32,512
Maybe I'll show you haven't done any of the work I meant to

1303
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:38,912
Do on my own ever identified without

1304
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,960
Him be like

1305
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:46,336
I'm going to go do the thing that seems hard

1306
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,760
Alex

1307
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,064
Clips of Trump's rally the night before

1308
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,720
Trump saying if

1309
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:06,560
If Hillary would want China would be number one in the world right now

1310
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,608
Baby the greatest

1311
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,912
Sure and Alex talked about what the plan

1312
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,248
So

1313
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Great

1314
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,672
Saudi Arabia in the world

1315
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
And you'd still be lowered

1316
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,120
Saudi Arabia

1317
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:48,032
Exports of crude oil have definitely if you're looking for someone

1318
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:53,664
While President Obama

1319
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
75

1320
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,480
That bad

1321
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,040
Responsive

1322
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:04,416
We're OPEC countries placed an embargo on oil sales

1323
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,952
Indian Kippur War

1324
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:11,328
The price of oil

1325
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
Royal

1326
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,400
That wasn't vulnerable to those sorts of action

1327
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,960
End. The export ban was put into place

1328
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,800
Much to the Chagrin of oil companies

1329
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,848
They just wanted to sell their oil for the highest

1330
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
Prophet

1331
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,408
And because of that

1332
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,688
Jimmy Carter

1333
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:36,416
Being an exporter of oil now a net exporter of oil

1334
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,952
Not still buying tons of it

1335
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
Important

1336
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:44,608
It just means big oil companies are taking the oil refined domestically and sell some of it

1337
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,656
Well we're also

1338
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,680
You and I

1339
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,960
We've still end up paying for

1340
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,984
Imported oil

1341
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,288
This is quite frankly

1342
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,824
Unless you're making money off

1343
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,176
Probably everything

1344
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,456
Involved

1345
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
Shity develop

1346
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,744
Play some clips of having an argument at an abortion rally

1347
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
Great

1348
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
On the street interviews

1349
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,120
Super important

1350
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,400
Relevant

1351
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:21,216
Hard-hitting news

1352
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
Relativism

1353
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,592
Riveting radio

1354
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,896
Abortion route

1355
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:34,784
So now playing clip Alex. Editorializing

1356
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,808
Is not attract

1357
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:45,536
Social worker

1358
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,864
Good money

1359
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,984
Social worker

1360
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,336
So I just decided she's a social worker

1361
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:03,200
Where is Ike I don't know she is I don't know she's not I don't really care

1362
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,992
But he says find out who she is

1363
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:07,040
He's asking his audience the docs

1364
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
This woman

1365
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,576
So

1366
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,208
Caution you Alex

1367
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
Doing any

1368
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,280
Anything like that

1369
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,864
It just seems like your

1370
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,912
You can't even help you

1371
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,728
Yourself

1372
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,264
These protists station

1373
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,592
He's making about the accusations

1374
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:38,016
There's a million examples of you doing exactly the behavior last Friday

1375
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:43,648
This girl is a video

1376
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:46,720
Discourse

1377
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,512
God Barnes

1378
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,048
So much

1379
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
So much

1380
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,376
Shmoney

1381
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:56,704
Just more advertising America

1382
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
So Alex

1383
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,264
Jumps from

1384
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,824
Insulting the abortion rally

1385
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,896
And then jumps over 2 videos

1386
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,920
Of whites

1387
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:06,944
Being attacked

1388
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,760
Outside the Trump rally by Somali

1389
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,296
Feel like that

1390
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:13,856
Well

1391
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:18,720
There's racist attacks going on around Trump rallies Jordan

1392
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:21,280
It's time for all good men to come to the aid of the party

1393
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
Successful when playing is Cliff

1394
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,424
Really

1395
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,592
Mostly the racial attacks.

1396
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,760
So again just

1397
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,344
Everywhere

1398
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,960
Flash

1399
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,064
He's real mad there

1400
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:22,464
Why is it that every f****** time

1401
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,768
2013

1402
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,560
Furious

1403
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,032
You're right you know what it is

1404
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:36,800
I

1405
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:41,920
If I had to give a theory highlighted everything that knows how to do I think people

1406
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:48,320
I think that he has a crew that is not nearly as smooth and you pretty

1407
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,392
Causing hiccups

1408
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:54,976
Pull the wrong clip

1409
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,024
I can't prove it

1410
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,584
But it would be exactly what you would see

1411
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,376
Is Alex is working with

1412
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:06,752
A thinned out staff

1413
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:11,872
Which is exactly what I would have predicted after he doesn't must go sale

1414
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:14,688
Yep or any of these other sales

1415
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:17,760
Or is it

1416
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,344
Competent people are going to leave

1417
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:29,024
Ferb

1418
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,560
Just had to leave my old job

1419
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,840
What was my old job

1420
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
You don't let's not talk about that

1421
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:38,752
Okay so there is a

1422
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:44,640
You would rather pretend

1423
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,712
How to make

1424
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,736
Has found

1425
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,528
A new source of Revenue

1426
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,832
I think that he's found a new sponsor

1427
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,136
Because there is a saying and neutering your pet

1428
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:58,464
No you're about to hear

1429
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,488
Is

1430
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,512
Paid program

1431
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,560
I have a very strong sense

1432
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,376
Cuz he's being paid to

1433
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:12,288
Freespeechtv

1434
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,336
To be able to talk

1435
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
About

1436
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:25,856
Eonline TV 40 boy

1437
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:32,512
Call wow

1438
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
Notably not you

1439
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:46,080
Worst Harrys Razor at you have a hard-on a podcast

1440
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,688
Seems like ad copy for ensure

1441
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,016
Like that's

1442
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:54,784
Classic

1443
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,648
Turn off my lawn

1444
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:05,280
Like you

1445
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,304
Bad

1446
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,704
Which brand himself a little date

1447
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,520
Hold on to anybody who might be inclined

1448
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,056
Come along with his new adventure

1449
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,384
I don't know

1450
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,224
Yeah no

1451
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
Surprising

1452
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,296
How

1453
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
Obviously

1454
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,344
It was like

1455
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,624
I get here

1456
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,184
Maybe they were trying to do that like

1457
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:36,000
Content that goes in there and it's

1458
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:36,768
Kind of like buzz

1459
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,960
He's an old-fashioned

1460
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,752
He's going to read

1461
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
Commercial

1462
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:57,248
In addition to that as a new source of Revenue

1463
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:03,648
He also has the Everything Must Go sale on right now

1464
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:07,488
Please remember we have to do everything

1465
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
Christmas

1466
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,120
Everything

1467
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,424
Is 30 to 70% off

1468
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,264
Appreciate

1469
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,800
It's amazing

1470
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:23,872
That's explicitly false advertising

1471
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:39,744
But if you're advertising for you to 70% off everything at 30%

1472
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,816
That's the misleading advertising

1473
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,840
Nobody

1474
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,408
For that violation is pretty small.

1475
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,016
Which is parking

1476
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:05,600
The show with a couple more calls

1477
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,880
Trying to take pretty quick

1478
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:13,280
Try to get the calls and realizes it on

1479
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,096
And the first guy is

1480
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,120
Absolutely

1481
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,400
100%

1482
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,936
Member of Christian

1483
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,264
Hi Alex I really appreciate your appetite

1484
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
Fraction today

1485
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:32,736
Ancient American scripture clearly states that the son of the Living God

1486
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:36,064
Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the God of this plan

1487
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,392
The author. Constitution for the United States

1488
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:48,352
He gave us all the tools necessary in the Constitution to restore the Republic

1489
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,960
You know it look at those people need

1490
01:39:54,240 --> 01:40:00,384
I don't know if that's right. Siding with you on

1491
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:06,016
Don't know I don't know what that answer awhile

1492
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:12,672
Your knee-jerk reaction of like you got to re-educate people is what I do I know that that's not necessarily A

1493
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,440
A good solution

1494
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,232
But I don't know what the solution is

1495
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:20,608
I'm opposed to your solution but I don't have a good one

1496
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,632
Beyond that

1497
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:29,824
You know you individually this would be able to be handled by

1498
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:36,224
You're going down this path you believe the Bible is an ancient American scripture

1499
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,552
We need to talk you'd hope

1500
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:43,392
People support networks that are able to

1501
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,184
To help with that

1502
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
Just gave Florida

1503
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:47,744
Play just give it to him

1504
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,512
That's not an answer

1505
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:54,912
I feel like that will lead a war against these Invaders

1506
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,448
Can identity people

1507
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,264
If they try and come down to Florida

1508
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,616
One last call

1509
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,640
Another guy

1510
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:07,200
To promote Max

1511
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:14,368
Russian here not sure if impeachment is inevitable but of the vein is 1736 worldwide

1512
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,632
Freedom

1513
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:41,248
Okay promoting

1514
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:44,832
Liberal

1515
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:51,232
Seize the new Wilder's or for bolsonaro

1516
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:56,608
That is one hundred percent in favor

1517
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,680
How can you

1518
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:04,032
Canada's Trump in there

1519
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,080
Going to be

1520
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,616
I pushed on Alex

1521
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,384
The show

1522
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,480
Control the collars or anything but you got it

1523
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:17,088
Is there is this much representation of the people who call into his show

1524
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,624
Bitters

1525
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,184
Message out about Bernier

1526
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,720
Then that means something

1527
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
They know that

1528
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,840
He might be somebody that appeals to the Infowars audience

1529
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,704
That lets you know ever

1530
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,520
Infowars

1531
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,104
Tumi

1532
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,896
I got a red flag

1533
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,712
Big red flag

1534
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:55,232
Like I said earlier I wanted to try and cover more ground couple episodes

1535
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,536
Mike Adams

1536
01:42:59,072 --> 01:42:59,840
Get out suck off

1537
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:06,240
And then I turned on Mondays listening to it was very clear

1538
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:11,872
Keith new stunt right

1539
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,896
Responses

1540
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,968
Spend more time doing another one of these

1541
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,992
Like it's just

1542
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:19,552
He's answered that sort of rarefied air

1543
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:25,952
Jacob Wohl

1544
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:33,376
I'm so went out for 2 hours today

1545
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,656
Like I'm not listen

1546
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,472
His other was about that

1547
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:39,264
Meme Trump

1548
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,640
Cutting off people's heads

1549
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,480
Defense about that

1550
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,904
The year old and we went out that doesn't really address the fact that

1551
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,928
This was

1552
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:04,352
It's just who cares I'm not going to descend to the level of bickering about

1553
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,144
So I just

1554
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,192
I heard that

1555
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:10,240
I heard that and I was like

1556
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,008
I don't

1557
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,288
I don't care

1558
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,640
I don't care about this Monday episode it's very it was very bad

1559
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Much more interesting

1560
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:21,248
Completely sucked up

1561
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,784
He talks a bunch of nonsense

1562
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,344
Oh yeah

1563
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,136
Like these real

1564
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,256
You know it's fine

1565
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,792
Callers advocating

1566
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,816
Victor

1567
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,632
Congress

1568
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:39,168
And I just flies on the show

1569
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:44,288
And educating the election of this

1570
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:47,104
I guess there's real-world trouble here

1571
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,432
The insanity of The Three Little Pigs

1572
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,296
Unprofessional laziness

1573
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,832
Combined with

1574
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,928
Mood swing down there

1575
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:02,976
We got it

1576
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:15,008
Pretty much

1577
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,616
Making those sorts of messages so if you

1578
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,152
Specifically about Trump

1579
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:21,920
You could

1580
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:26,016
Conceivably think that what he means is executive orders

1581
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:30,624
I know that

1582
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,928
That you could use that as a

1583
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
But that's

1584
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,096
Weird

1585
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:40,864
Sometimes it's

1586
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,912
It seems like just his mood swings are enough

1587
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,752
Like just to know the inability to

1588
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,520
To handle any

1589
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:50,848
Adversity at all

1590
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:55,456
Absolutely

1591
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,992
Tanner and tone of the show

1592
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,016
And that's like

1593
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:05,440
I don't know

1594
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,464
Should exist

1595
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:13,376
Butts

1596
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,008
It's knowledge

1597
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,568
True

1598
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:28,736
Go to bed Jordan I'm pretty sure we're on Facebook

1599
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,088
Word on the street

1600
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,392
We are also

1601
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,160
Astrolabe Searcy

1604
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:49,216
