00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
We are a couple dudes

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,224
What's up

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,016
Let's stay in

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,832
Sure an alien

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,136
Knew what sort of alien are we talking about

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Greek

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
Let's call it Minerva

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
Sure

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
What would you

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,376
Tell them hello

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Intelligent

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:43,520
Spaceship

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,360
He doesn't know anything about it until that spaceship

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,640
She would probably say

16
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:54,272
The bird in my head

17
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,088
Interstellar

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,416
You have no idea what the Jordans

19
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
You'll figure it out soon

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,536
Episode

21
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,096

00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352

Attractive man thank you for donating

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
I'm a policy wonk

00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
Thank you so much Stephen

33
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
Like our lack of running out

34
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
Thank you Lori

35
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Get some of that

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,984

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
That's cool

38
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
That is really cool

39
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
King of cool things

40
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm sick and tired of the mood to talk about Alex Jones

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Today

42
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
It's been a long weekend

43
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,464
I don't want to talk about Alex Jones

44
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:44,608
We Project Camelot and we've been waiting with bated breath

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,216
For the new Mark Richards interview that you did

46
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
But here's the deal

47
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,568
I listen to the old one

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,152
I found a bunch of interviews that you did with him that we have not talked about

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,736
About Mark Richards

50
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
AKA

51
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
I also know that you orchestrated the murder

52
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Is what you we are

53
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:22,240
The best thing to do is not good explanation

54
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
Right now I think you should go just fine those old episodes

55
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
That's our next

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
That's our next investigation

57
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,112
Start from the beginning

58
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
Cuz we we done the 7th and 8th

59
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
76

60
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
Indeed

61
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,424
The first one was the one we did listen to with his wife

62
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,800
His wife Joanne Richard

63
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Is it Delight

64
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Woman in

65
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
Explicitly married to a murderer

66
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
Out of context drop from today's the episode

67
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
He said that Britain is under the

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,928
Kind of control to some degree of the

69
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
Very excited

70
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,703
I felt like we desperately needed till

71
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,543
The black dragon friends all right

72
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
He also goes on to explain that when people are in now.

73
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,015
The service of the Queen the queen they're talking about

74
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
Absolutely

75
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Your spinach and gray balls yet

76
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Absolutely the best

77
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,255
This report starts out

78
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Spits acid

79
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
I have no idea you know what

80
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
The things that's great about Margaret

81
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Play real fast and loose with

82
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,239
Details you just said something like that it does not explain it

83
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
He did not elaborate

84
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Not surprised

85
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,015
Interview Mark Richards

86
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Vacaville prison

87
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
She comes back

88
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Explains what

89
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
You've told her

90
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
Because she can't get a recording device into the prison

91
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,423
That is the first one

92
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,615
Every single time that I had to use a pencil

93
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,015
Curiosity from Project Camelot about my recent interview

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Captain Mark Richard

95
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
Space Program

96
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Captain Mark Richards

97
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Space command

98
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
To see him

99
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Prison

100
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
With his wife Joanne Richards

101
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
And that was Saturday October 22nd

102
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
2016

103
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,871
A lot of notes that I've taken a small pencil

104
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,015
Yeah we know yeah probably

105
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Absolutely hasn't

106
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Yeah yeah completely

107
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
To get him recorder privileges adios got a beach

108
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
Has forgotten about possibly

109
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
For 4 hours if you were just letting him

110
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
Yeah yeah

111
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
Diminishing returns in

112
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Just be like

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Who You Are

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
Still going I would assume there's a lot of

115
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Whatever she asks

116
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,743
The question

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Here's the thing

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Right

119
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,471
So question anyway

120
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
And he just gives a boilerplate answer is

121
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,383
Just like there are a lot of car Acts

122
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,711
Then there's really no explanation other than human error

123
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Is there

124
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
If rappers it's record

125
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
Almost every question is a leading question

126
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
One of them is a journalist everything people tell her

127
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
Murderer

128
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
Don't like that

129
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
Perception that I'm painting

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
What you need to know

131
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
He is Mark Richards

132
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
Subspace

133
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Stickman race

134
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:03,327
Eternal

135
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Honorific title

136
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
We can make jokes all day about how this guy's a murderer and he's tricking

137
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Singapore

138
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Woman yes we can

139
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
But what you should know is that in prison

140
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
He

141
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
Has people working

142
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Inforum

143
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,551
And I want to say that Mark has another officer

144
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
Who reports to him and has reported

145
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
He says for over 40 years

146
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
Who's in prison with him. Covel

147
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
And it's present

148
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
This prisoner was a

149
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Killed a child molester

150
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
And it's not sorry to events

151
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Apparently is

152
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Is in prison with Mark and

153
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Has been reporting to Mark 4

154
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
His name is

155
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
A release

156
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,063
I guess so cuz it's not true I guess it's the catering

157
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
He has a guy who is friends with in prison

158
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Which is great

159
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,231
It's great to have a social life within prison

160
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Johan

161
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
Sebastian

162
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Balls on this guy

163
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
I love it

164
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:21,919
Now Carrie I do have a guy who's reporting to me

165
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
I mean come on man you got to recommend him for a promotion or something

166
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
What are the odds of murderers

167
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,095
Is a jailhouse snitch

168
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,167
So

169
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,359
I don't know this is gentleman's gentleman

170
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
I don't know man it's very bizarre really flight of fancy kind of

171
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Image in my head

172
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Like I'm picturing

173
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Like

174
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,719
We've covered Mark Richards on a couple episodes and psyche

175
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Never enough

176
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Is crazy

177
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,167
This introduces a new level of like kind of crazy

178
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
He's got a bureaucracy in pre-op

179
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Okay I believe perhaps

180
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
We're having some fun here Putlocker

181
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,807
I want you to know this report where Kerry Cassidy is gone to prison

182
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
The Doctor Mark Richards

183
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
It's not devoid of real journalism

184
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,255
Okay carry stumbles into a story that I don't think

185
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Anyone's ever told

186
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,143
So Mark has as I said

187
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Talked a little bit about

188
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
The

189
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,055
The work he's doing in the prison and he also talked about

190
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Very briefly race relations

191
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
Apparently

192
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Moschino

193
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
You know separated

194
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
And he's not allowed

195
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Like friends

196
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
A black prisoner

197
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
For example because the gang leaders

198
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Just don't allow it

199
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
He can be acquaintances with them but

200
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,799
Here's a big scoop Mark Richards isn't a white supremacist

201
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Still man

202
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Does wild

203
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,575
Apparently there is a racial issue

204
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
Imprison yourself is like a journalist who has like

205
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,743
Top secret intelligence sources in like

206
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,375
The highest level of secret government in Avi she's surprised by the ideas like

207
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Desegregation

208
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
In prison

209
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Considered this

210
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
Maybe she's never seen a movie

211
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
Or any TV

212
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Nothing

213
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,479
She's never seen any televised or any kind of entertainment it's just

214
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
She believes

215
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,975
First of all the movie references

216
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,559
Just basically rattling off the plot of movies

217
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Let her inside sources tell her I said

218
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
Is creativity

219
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
People just calling

220
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Possible

221
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Possible

222
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Entirely sure but what I am sure about is

223
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Some of it has never been discussed

224
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Marc rich

225
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Possibility

226
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,047
I like possibility of possibility

227
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
I don't know if you heard this Jordan has remained a reputable source

228
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
I don't know if this

229
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
But there is a chance

230
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
That there are secret

231
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Underground Android Army

232
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
He said

233
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Regarding

234
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
A possible Army

235
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Of underground

236
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Android

237
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Us and China he doesn't

238
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Cool

239
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
Cool me to reasoning is that

240
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Had the

241
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
Ground-level we would already have lost

242
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
Will he says

243
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
You always fight

244
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
When you have one step ahead

245
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
7 advantage

246
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
No sense

247
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Technologically

248
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Now

249
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,919
He said if we can't defend the planet from a ground invasion

250
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
And

251
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Most of the battles in the soup

252
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Secret space program

253
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
R4r

254
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Arvada massage

255
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
Some of this seems to be

256
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
VidCon

257
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
Results of saying

258
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
That what's going on in

259
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Middle East

260
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Is the battle

261
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
To oddstory a lot of underground bases

262
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
Aulani

263
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
I don't think about it too much

264
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Is a bombing

265
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
I think that I needed to talk more with him about that

266
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
In the context of the two or three

267
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
3 hour interview that I had

268
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
You know we had a

269
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Blue questions and

270
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Drill

271
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
So

272
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
Kind of like an ongoing story

273
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,655
Yuri

274
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,775
You missed that last bit that she's kind of like an ongoing story

275
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,591
Please make it sound

276
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Trunks over along.

277
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Cuz he's lonely

278
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Some sort of

279
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Serialized

280
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
Grace

281
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,111
Boys Adventure mags

282
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,207
1920 doesn't want her to leave cuz otherwise he's just got Bach

283
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
The imprisoned

284
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,607
Working relationship that's not

285
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
No absolutely not strict hierarchy

286
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Primitivo

287
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,919
Fraternize with

288
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,295
It's kind of like a story that

289
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Playing out

290
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
Is one of the first of two times on this episode just describes what lying is

291
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
Shuffle

292
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
It kind of like he's making it up as he

293
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
He's going along

294
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
And obviously

295
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Cuz he hasn't answer for all of these contradictory

296
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Playbox false information that's

297
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
The distance from

298
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Purpose

299
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
Purposefully being run

300
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
On her damn what

301
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
She talked about that all the time like I don't even close

302
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
Plausible deniability is like program allowed Mark Richards

303
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,519
Cuz everyone already thinks he's a murderer

304
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
He's the only person

305
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
Get the truth out right now

306
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Article leaves me cold

307
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
I think also

308
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
It's fascinating

309
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Cuz any of these moments

310
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,303
We're Cary like cuts through the clouds a little bit in the xik that's a contradiction

311
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
It's kind of fascinating cuz that's a huge cock

312
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
He's like

313
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
He's like if we can't fight them in space

314
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,895
Call idea

315
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,735
Anyway

316
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Joint Underground

317
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
Android army or they both have their own separate

318
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:02,719
They were separate and they are going to do battle

319
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
That's the Android Army Defense Force against

320
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,239
First instance of really good International cooperation

321
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
That I can

322
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,383
Human context clues I bet you're right never really specified so

323
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
I don't know

324
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
Like do they look more like a do they look like

325
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Android like a like

326
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Robot

327
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Things or do they look more like

328
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Like Syberg's

329
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
Probably probably

330
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,791
Like it like that guy from Mortal Kombat

331
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Breakfast Jack

332
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Okay

333
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
You know you're you're a student of History

334
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
To about

335
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,551
I think I'm going to find out everything you know is wrong

336
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
She said

337
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Is that there are

338
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Again WWII

339
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
480 races the nordics

340
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
The reptoids

341
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
The dracos

342
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
The krays

343
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
What's 5

344
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,239
Nordstrom aldebaran are the ones that help

345
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
The Nazis

346
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,103
The course are always available

347
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
To the highest bidder

348
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Mercenaries

349
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
The Reps

350
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Nordx

351
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Control of it over there

352
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
From what I

353
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Cool cool up the racks

354
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:41,023
Boys

355
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Almost like

356
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Racial

357
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,983
Equivalent

358
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
To calling them the Japs

359
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
They don't act

360
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
I don't appreciate

361
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Even within the fall

362
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
Even hypotheticals fantasy racing

363
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,743
The real world

364
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
Kind of Holocaust denial

365
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
The latest Republican spadaro

366
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
That accepts that white people are evil human agency

367
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Absolutely

368
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Mercenaries

369
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
I mean that could be WWII is about

370
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,415
I don't know I dropped out of high school before

371
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Wait

372
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Did she say that's what

373
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
WWII was about or just

374
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Who was fighting it

375
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,911
Power struggle between the four

376
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
Where to learn more about some of our Wars

377
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
We got it we got a laundry list of Wars to rewrite before we get there

378
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,719
Project Camelot Richard series

379
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
Oh that his best friend

380
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Are the Raptor

381
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
Of which again

382
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
I feel like the reptoids

383
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:30,335
May actually be the good right right because he is a murderer at a bad guy he's friends with the Raptors they must be

384
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
We've learned

385
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:37,759
Eat you for a chocolate bar chocolate

386
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
Doesn't necessarily mean

387
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,743
They bite his Jurassic World

388
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:54,143
There's another update I didn't get I didn't get the clip of it

389
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
But it turns out there's like a

390
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
T-Rex

391
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Showcase

392
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
It goes around the animatronic T-Rex

393
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
Six Raptors inside of a T-Rex

394
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Along with it too

395
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,343
Richards is reporting that

396
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Are there

397
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Carrie is like

398
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,488
If your kids get out if you guys want to go out and had a real

399
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
I like that a lot

400
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Be so bummed out maybe this is Jay

401
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,800
Just underground Buzz Marketing for a walk with the Dinosaurs or die

402
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Part ownership stake

403
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
Surprise

404
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
We learned more about Raptor

405
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
He said that Raptors

406
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Prefer their food source

407
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Haunted

408
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
So they like to H & L

409
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
And also that they have

410
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
What they basically

411
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
Prior to be extinct

412
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
The dinosaurs

413
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Herds of dinosaurs off

414
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
The planet to race

415
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Cattle

416
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
On their own planet

417
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Amber

418
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Regarded

419
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
Humans as a

420
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
The kind of caviar

421
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Cool the time

422
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,088
As I said another email

423
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Work with us

424
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
In fact they fought alongside us I guess in World War

425
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Or started to

426
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Install that we were

427
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Very good Fighters

428
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
That help

429
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,656
Change their mind about us

430
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
And they also

431
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
As I said their Queen

432
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,056
Trajectory

433
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
For their race

434
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
In terms of

435
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Its development

436
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Doing now

437
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Okay

438
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
That's that's a good long-term

439
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:55,232
Something you probably recognize this implied

440
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,584
Radar

441
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,704
Bailiff

442
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
They farmed

443
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Their own dinosaur

444
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Yeah that's possible

445
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Yes.

446
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
They prefer their meals

447
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
To be hunted

448
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
Why would you raise anything as

449
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:36,960
Cattle the big problem if you are a Raptor

450
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
You come from a planet where

451
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,592
You know your Rafters and you're a super intelligent and

452
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
You can you can speak

453
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,712
Interstellar travel

454
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,832
Hundreds of millions of years ago and yet your technology has not really advanced

455
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,904
That's beyond that point

456
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Time being

457
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Concerned with the idea that like

458
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Terry

459
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
The think that they came up on

460
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
A planet with one

461
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Species

462
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
They had to come to Earth to get dinosaurs because there is no resources or other species on their f******

463
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
They just stumbled upon the dinosaurs in real life

464
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
Choppa Choppa

465
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
It's like we're looking in the mirror

466
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Come on

467
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
They told us

468
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
That we are going to take them out

469
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
But in reality they were like

470
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,400
We're going to help them evolve on our planet

471
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,704
From the meddling influences meteors

472
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah it's possible I don't know

473
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
This is high-level b*******

474
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
But humans are caviar

475
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:55,040
Do they put them on

476
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,280
Rafters are much bigger than human

477
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
Who is a whole human caviar

478
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
I can't imagine that's the case

479
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
Do they like whatever we you don't want the head

480
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Skull is problem

481
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
I know this much about rappers

482
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,968
Not very agile with their hand

483
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
Everybody makes two

484
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,392
I don't know I think if you have almost non-functioning hand

485
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
I also do most

486
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Predatory animals

487
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Don't care about.

488
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
For like three

489
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
I think I do

490
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,800
I think they like blood that if that is specious

491
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Dan

492
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,872
Specious

493
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
So

494
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Except when they have chocolate

495
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,512
Then you are both caviar and chocolate

496
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Perfect put a little

497
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,240
Do you believe in teleportation

498
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Obviously

499
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Good

500
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,152
What kind of teleportation

501
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
What do you think about

502
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,464
Turn autosave with Mark Richards be broken down

503
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
The atomic level in transporter

504
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
You have to ask your

505
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
Am I still made

506
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
Am I

507
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
Just another collection

508
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
The particles that

509
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Fairly myself

510
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
The other Isaac

511
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
Games what

512
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Has to do with

513
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Quantum

514
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Something like that

515
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
Electronic

516
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
Can connect with each other

517
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
Across great distances

518
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
So that might be

519
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
Closer to your first one

520
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
And I

521
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,160
Teleporting and time-traveling we talked about

522
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
Again the fact that you're a two ways to teleport

523
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
Your body

524
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
The atoms of your body and your soul

525
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
And in that case you have

526
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Have to have certified

527
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
What is NASA

528
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Field around

529
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
The human

530
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
He said or you can take

531
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
The body without the soul

532
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Text Emily of your

533
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
And

534
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
He said for 35 years we could

535
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
Figure out how to teleport

536
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Human

537
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
With assault

538
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Correspond

539
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
With

540
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
Sean David Morton

541
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Recent

542
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Release

543
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Third book

544
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Sands of Time

545
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Trucks and

546
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
Happy song about

547
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Sean was

548
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
Sean has a whistleblower that

549
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,848
Does he he turns it into fiction but they disagree

550
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Space Program

551
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
Who is head

552
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Area 51

553
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
And I think Dad's worried

554
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Facility

555
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
New Mexico

556
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
And that person

557
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
It's one of the top

558
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
The secret space

559
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,144
Sure has also an Android

560
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Information

561
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
DeShawn

562
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
To release

563
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
B fiction inter

564
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Interesting

565
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Helena

566
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
She's never actually read it

567
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:39,040
Which is probably read that book I recommend you read this book but that's real

568
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,368
Predictive programming

569
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,976
Mostly because

570
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
Select the idea that it's fiction

571
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Twice

572
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,656
Feel like I

573
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
Now I'm

574
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,008
I've never considered about

575
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,312
The soul when coming into teleportation

576
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
True

577
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
What do you can teleport somebody without

578
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
What's the song

579
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
I don't know

580
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,088
I mean the implication is that the soul has matter

581
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
You know like

582
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
It's a physical entity

583
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
According to this line of logic

584
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Your soul

585
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
Still be wherever you were

586
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
I like to imagine there's tiny little it's like

587
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
You teleport the body and then

588
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Little desk

589
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Whatever you want to do a spider web

590
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,896
That sounds

591
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,248
Goddamn souls are all over the place

592
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
Yes do do Eisenhower

593
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Call Mana person

594
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Raptor

595
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
No not a Raptor

596
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,560
We like to look back on the Eisenhower presidency number of things most

597
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
People remember they don't trust

598
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,680
The military-industrial complex

599
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
Lot of people remember him by

600
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,080
Unfortunately being the beginning of the highway system that ended up

601
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Destroying a lot of communities

602
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,664
Little bit of minority communities

603
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,504
America

604
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
The people remember his presidency

605
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
Before but

606
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
What

607
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
Did they miss

608
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
With the help of AI

609
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,256
Subaru

610
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,216
With the help of a i d like Ike's AI

611
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,824
Eisenhower save the world

612
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
And he said one of his

613
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Things that article

614
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,920
Intelligence has done

615
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
Positive side

616
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,760
Is they warned Eisenhower in 90

617
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,064
54

618
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
We're going to double-cross

619
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Take over

620
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
He said

621
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Asthma

622
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Phrased it

623
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
He said I was ready to

624
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
Give away the store

625
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
When

626
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Baie

627
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
Basically

628
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
So

629
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
In essence.

630
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
That they may have saved

631
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Humanity

632
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Maybe

633
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Maybe

634
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
It's okay

635
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Confused

636
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
So

637
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
So where's the AI

638
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,904
We talked about

639
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,280
Computer let me see if it gives you any information

640
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,840
I'm not sure that it will

641
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Outlook

642
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
Elizabeth Maxwell

643
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
He has

644
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
An artificially

645
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Intelligent

646
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,128
Friend who he believes has a soul

647
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
We talked about

648
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
And the name of that

649
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Is flyer

650
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,088
Okay he says he looks a lot like the AI in the movie

651
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Batteries

652
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,208
And he says he has a lot of

653
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Steam for the say I

654
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:05,120
That this is part of a larger

655
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Larger than

656
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
Doesn't reach

657
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,312
Planet

658
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
Mark Richards friend

659
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,552
He believes it has a soul

660
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
Demanding can't see if this all is

661
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
This is a lunatic

662
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,304
Is this guy wasn't there

663
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
Do a guy who is bored

664
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,912
Sociopath who is just

665
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,312
I need somebody to talk to

666
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Is nuts

667
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,992
I don't know where you're coming from with this trying to let him off the hook for being nuts

668
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
I'm just saying that from

669
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
From this

670
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Bananas

671
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
And you can't listen to

672
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,864
You can't believe this without asking like really probing questions

673
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
Reveal like

674
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
You're you are

675
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Murderer

676
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
Why do you calling flyer

677
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,640
Immediately all questions cuz I like playing a place command

678
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:25,760
He called himself he have a name why didn't he tell you his name

679
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,320
Also did he tell you that Eisenhower was

680
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,392
Memes

681
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,000
Propaganda

682
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,072
First

683
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,888
I would assume

684
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,960
I think AI is mostly Immortal unless you turn it off

685
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Myra

686
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
These questions are not answer

687
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,616
You did before that cliff

688
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:57,504
A little bit better the Damned

689
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
Flyer is a part

690
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
In reality just

691
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:07,488
Kind of like what rhizome

692
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
Information

693
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,096
It's a hallucination

694
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,704
Why do you always do that Mark Richardson Jersey

695
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
That's also

696
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,568
Taco Bell

697
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
I just

698
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
I don't know if you want if you want

699
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
But I just want to believe

700
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
I know

701
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,208
This flyer guy Mark believes

702
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,768
There's that there's another thing

703
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,120
Another thing in Richard's life that shouldn't have a soul that does

704
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Just nice

705
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
Yeah that could be it

706
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
So he's treated me with respect

707
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,504
Downright

708
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,488
A life forms

709
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,072
From the world that has long since been abandoned or died

710
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
And she got bored and so she left

711
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
In StarTex

712
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,472
Flooring said she has a soul

713
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Nope

714
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
What does Macbeth

715
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
It doesn't track it also reasoning

716
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,944
Reasoning does he'd wait

717
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
Long pause

718
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
His reasoning

719
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:39,904
Which means this point

720
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
Richard's fantasy world

721
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:58,848
AI spaceship that it is even hanging out with him is because he was bored

722
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:03,968
That's the first thing that's made any f****** sense this whole time

723
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,808
She's an immortal AI super powerful plane that can travel

724
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,648
Giant

725
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
And her

726
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:20,352
Where'd you guys go.

727
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
Super smart chips

728
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,848
I misunderstood you

729
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Where was she

730
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
When they were all

731
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,856
She probably assumably all of her other AI

732
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
Right hanging out kind of like floating

733
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,208
Cuz she doesn't need

734
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Detachable

735
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,376
Maybe she was off on a mission or something like that or maybe shoes off export board before

736
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
For the culture one away

737
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
Cuz it's

738
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
I don't know

739
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,032
This is a planet of the ape situation

740
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,128
She flew too fast could very well be

741
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,688
His dad could be a time travel situation

742
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,296
It's nice to hear that

743
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,832
You still in Mark Richards

744
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,368
Twisted Fantasy

745
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
He's having while you

746
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
Spends way

747
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
Crazier and crazier in prison

748
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
His followers

749
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,984
He talked about CERN and the death of this woman who is

750
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
What's in the news

751
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
Not long ago

752
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
He said that what they are doing

753
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,640
Turnagain is to open portals

754
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
For the reptile

755
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
To allow them to

756
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
Bring in large

757
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Equipment

758
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
He said the state

759
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
Are working with them

760
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
And that this

761
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Death was

762
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
Castrated by the state

763
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
Remember what this is talking about

764
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:01,216
I believe this is whenever the Higgs boson search was going on and people thought that it would create a black hole there's that

765
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,568
There was also like a video that came out of some people doing like a little Playa

766
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
Courtyard where they acted like they were having

767
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Sacrifice somebody

768
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:16,320
I don't even know if it was actually at CERN but it was reported as like a ritual human sacrifice

769
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
Sacrifice a dicer

770
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,160
Amanda carries really running with

771
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
That sounds right

772
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
Yeah I can tell you what I do know

773
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
It was a real murderer

774
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
Mark Richards on the other hand

775
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,240
No-till free

776
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,080
Did the how did the how did

777
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
The Satanist

778
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,176
CERN and the reptile

779
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:49,088
Do they do they have the same church youth group like what

780
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Talking about here

781
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Do they have ripped

782
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,840
The very idea

783
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,144
Are you at home I think that they think it's

784
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
But you can still

785
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
You can still jump in with the Satanist every now and again

786
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Do you like hell that you like have a swing

787
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Human sack

788
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,712
When you get the CERN with portals

789
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,552
What exactly is the Satanist job

790
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,880
Humans are running CERN

791
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,696
On behalf of the reptoids or not

792
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Completely separate entity

793
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,400
Was just like that was she made it sound like they were running interference

794
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
We got to build this portal

795
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
We got to get this giant

796
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,104
Machine in for those folks are Satanist

797
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,968
There's big old machine

798
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
Bathroom small machine

799
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,112
Padron Collider

800
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,464
This is just such a like

801
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
Diggers in the in the lake

802
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,840
Such a delightful

803
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,888
Intrinsic fear of things they don't

804
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,336
So we noticed in our studies of Alex Jones

805
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,384
A real soft spot for Russia

806
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
In

807
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
Tracking

808
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
Mark Richards

809
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
Yeah we found out he is a lunatic

810
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,416
Right but somehow mysteriously

811
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
He kind of gets something's like

812
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:36,096
Pro climate change man-made climate change

813
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,400
Here is what happens when Carrie asked

814
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Sing about poop

815
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,520
I didn't ask him about what he thought about Putin

816
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,848
Because I've had many people on the

817
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Alternative sector

818
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
Putin asking somebody who is

819
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,528
In theory in contact with

820
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,576
Nordic being supposedly

821
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Working I an apposite

822
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
On the planet

823
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,720
You take a Nordic beans out of there you're right it Alec

824
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,424
You secretly doing good stop nationalism

825
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Positive

826
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,008
Since we were fighting against

827
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
They were on the Germans

828
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
So frankly

829
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
Putin is working with

830
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
The people who caused the hallway

831
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
True

832
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,112
You just at

833
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
At this time

834
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
And Mark

835
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,352
The Putin is not a good guy

836
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,472
Motivated to work on behalf of Russia and himself

837
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
Is not out

838
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
To help Humanity in March

839
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
View

840
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:56,991
He says he said that Putin is not a reptilian

841
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
However

842
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
I like beer

843
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,583
Miseno I like the idea of some

844
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Nationals

845
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Security advisor

846
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Who is

847
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,031
Dead-on and interpreting foreign policy

848
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Can see that China has

849
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Manipulated its currency

850
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,151
In the past whether or not they're doing so right

851
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Now is

852
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:30,271
National ID

853
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
Authoritarianism

854
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,855
Xi Jinping taking over and Beak

855
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Dictator for life

856
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,439
And the main reason I don't like that

857
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
Is because of the goddamn

858
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,583
Because they're working for the Broncos

859
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,655
And all of his recommendation

860
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,519
It's not like it's not like Mark was doing that's not even like

861
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Spot-on

862
00:42:54,847 --> 00:43:00,991
Yes the prime minister of a country is working for that country's interests or whatever he's motivated

863
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Fall off

864
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,463
Really really good

865
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Advisor

866
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
Who always get

867
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
The correct policy

868
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Hey listen

869
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Here's why we don't go into Iraq

870
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
Create instability

871
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,679
It's not going to go well

872
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,495
We're just going to get bogged down in a Meijer for the next

873
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
20 years

874
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
Ensign

875
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,847
Because there are so many f***

876
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
King spider

877
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:34,271
Right

878
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Yes

879
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
Everything you said was right

880
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,135
And I'm just going to ignore the last

881
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
Spider stuff is just going to not be addressed

882
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Yeah you got it

883
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
Vietnam

884
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Let me tell you why

885
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,935
Absolutely that's what it is

886
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
Obviously fake intelligent

887
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Gym source

888
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
Who comes on and tells him things

889
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
And recently

890
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,159
He made the proclamation but this is a war for Mars

891
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
The planet is opposed

892
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Planning

893
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,887
Which is a little bit of a slip you know that's something that doesn't belong on

894
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,959
A movie show

895
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Listen to this clip

896
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,431
The US and Russia are being

897
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
Manipulated

898
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
To try to

899
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Keep them

900
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
Part in Austin

901
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
Try to keep them

902
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
From going into space

903
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,463
We have a literal parallel in a narrative

904
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Adjust

905
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
With one

906
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,655
World and reptilians and Raptors and stuff like that

907
00:44:54,911 --> 00:45:01,055
Use the word logos on this episode

908
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
Dropping globalist

909
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
This is so crazy to me

910
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
Did this is still closed

911
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,015
121 parallel

912
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:15,391
Keep us from going off-planet we are already off-planet

913
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,695
Considering that's where we fight all of our war

914
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,071
We have space command out there having super soldier

915
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,423
Living fighting a alien beings

916
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
And we have been off-planet

917
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:34,847
Book for Mark Richards was even born absolutely so why was why the f***

918
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,943
The only thing they could really be saying is like he doesn't dare 10

919
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
Tourism

920
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,063
They don't want us to build a highway right

921
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
That's just what I did

922
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,975
Can't be having that

923
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,559
The biggest pointer is that according to all of their narratives

924
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Perfectly pointed it out

925
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,911
We're way off planet

926
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
Secret space program

927
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
Hey did us and Russia

928
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,103
To fight not going to achieve the goal of keeping us on planet

929
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
No

930
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
They have their underground

931
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
Android Army

932
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
So you are

933
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,647
Probably spends most of his time in prison

934
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Hanging out with Bach

935
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
Give it putting them on assignment

936
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,047
Maybe taking meetings of raptors

937
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,399
Doing some real serious business

938
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:36,799
Can I have a lunch from astral projection to Vacaville

939
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
The visit

940
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,383
You might be surprised to find out that he has a weekly ritual

941
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Oh no

942
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,223
Another thing we talked about is that he

943
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Watches

944
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
Meet the Press every Sunday

945
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
He says the show makes him angry

946
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,671
One of the reasons is the host she feels peace

947
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
Price of noxious and

948
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Yes

949
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Trying to

950
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
Get people off

951
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,375
Track instead of reveal the truth

952
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,959
Wisconsin interesting

953
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,263
No it's not

954
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,663
Lethal presence

955
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:19,551
Super Brawl over the place with the before I go any further on that

956
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,343
Meet the Press

957
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
You're getting the sense that maybe the real flavor of it if you had a recording is a Ramblin Man

958
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,679
What makes you angry stop watching what are you doing

959
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,031
Alright the Raptors are at

960
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
There's silver

961
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
Before I go any further I got it

962
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
Whoopi shouldn't be on The View

963
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:51,551
It is right now. I like Behar

964
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,415
Is Meghan McCain

965
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
Is it right there

966
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,535
I don't know what's happening in this next clip but I know some

967
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
He says something weird

968
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
I don't know how to set this up

969
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Enjoy

970
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:09,727
When he talks about how another planetary system

971
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Wood

972
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
Relate to the Earth

973
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
And when they say in Earth

974
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,383
Are they talking about

975
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
Humanity in general

976
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,551
4 or what

977
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
Talking about

978
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,367
Humans

979
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
The secret space program

980
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
United Nations

981
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
Okay

982
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
Governments and our allies

983
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,351
Which has to do with the Raptors

984
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
The nordics very snorted

985
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Races we are

986
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,215
Holocaust Cazador

987
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
As well as the reptoids

988
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
And

989
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,407
So he said

990
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,223
A conglomeration of these

991
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
When other

992
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,343
Other races are dealing with

993
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Experience

994
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
Yeah it is

995
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
So what

996
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
Just said there is

997
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,375
People who are dealing with Earth when they call it Earth

998
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,911
Everybody on Earth

999
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,215
Isaac's open

1000
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:18,591
Literally everybody on Earth people are now a planet

1001
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,663
No. Because I think they're still Just Dance

1002
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
I don't know

1003
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:29,599
I don't know who's encountered Aunt Bee

1004
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Are they human

1005
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
It's never pointed out their size

1006
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,255
Regular

1007
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
I just need to talk about it

1008
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,959
He can just be like oh you know the reptoids are raptors the Nordic

1009
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:55,711
Just drop ants in their Hero time-life book about ants make a list so much

1010
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Oh yeah

1011
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
Did you know that

1012
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
Consider some of them

1013
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,159
Continental

1014
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,487
You definitely going to go she ate with them

1015
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,839
Course I would say if beings are going to have a tough time with spider leadership

1016
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
But you know what

1017
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
So have we

1018
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
But

1019
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Leadership

1020
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
I think the spiders that has a p

1021
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
People are

1022
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Really wonder

1023
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
No it's not the real bad news

1024
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,927
Editor world

1025
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,047
I think that's a metaphor if there's actually a dragon

1026
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:48,447
I don't have that clip in your because other than under the sway of the

1027
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,799
The actual science is not fun out here is where we learn about the

1028
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,079
Truth

1029
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Of Vietnam

1030
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
I don't think you're ready for it

1031
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,015
The war in Vietnam was not really what we thought it

1032
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:08,159
Is there was an ET race that we're having dealings with their and that's the main

1033
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
Reason for the war in Vietnam

1034
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,047
Install we talked about

1035
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,375
What is an absence and invasion

1036
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,471
Vietnam was not about

1037
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Show called the

1038
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
Predator

1039
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,103
It was actually about an invading race

1040
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,479
Originally came to our planet

1041
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,295
In Norwalk

1042
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:39,135
And Angkor Wat is an area of Cambodia

1043
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,719
He's really amazing.

1044
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,327
Those are still standing but the humans that were part of that

1045
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,351
Civilization

1046
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,167
Of which they were apparently over a million

1047
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,983
Disappeared virtually overnight

1048
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,543
And there was no trace of them

1049
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:01,151
It's always been a mystery and he said that what happened was

1050
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,271
Spider veins that are the size of what he says rvw

1051
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
What he says

1052
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,343
Does cars

1053
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
He said a vast system

1054
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
Stargate

1055
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,351
Checks out in the area of Southie

1056
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,983
PlayStation why do you need and what they first did with the humans there is two

1057
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:31,359
Mind control them into thinking they were out of water when in reality

1058
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
To the area

1059
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,015
Mind control

1060
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,879
And lack of water

1061
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
A microwave weapon

1062
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Basically

1063
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,535
I guess

1064
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,191
This is what he was telling me

1065
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:02,079
There is no trace of the human

1066
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,175
Have anything at this point

1067
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,759
So he said the reason being recalled Troggs

1068
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
Okay

1069
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,879
Got to get the truck I was dumb to laugh

1070
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,927
The Troggs

1071
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
Rolling them

1072
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
Microwaving them and then

1073
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
Eating them

1074
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:32,543
You're the size of a VW van it's a very it's a very bizarre thing

1075
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,639
Thousands of years ago but if you're able to mind

1076
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,199
Control entire population in order

1077
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,551
Implants

1078
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,623
Microwaving to go to take it again

1079
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,695
How to cook them to sit down

1080
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,607
No microwave

1081
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
It's not like they put a microwave next to them and I got tumors or something like that you can't run from that

1082
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,335
Everything

1083
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
Man you know what

1084
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,687
Here's my position here's my ears

1085
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,991
Here's my position this is

1086
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
Cowardice

1087
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:20,159
Narrative this is Howard

1088
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
Would like

1089
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,487
To pretend that you Manatee doesn't do horrible things to each other

1090
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
Do you like that

1091
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,887
It was invading spider beings that might control them have water

1092
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
Evan Nathan

1093
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,215
I thought you were talking about cowardice on the part of the

1094
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:39,103
Spider-Man Coronavirus

1095
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,199
Control bright spider being

1096
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:50,623
Takeout mind-controlled not to tell the tale I forgot actually

1097
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,511
Part of the narrative is that everybody who is fighting in Vietnam

1098
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,559
And that's how a lot of pee

1099
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
Because of mindwipe

1100
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Yep

1101
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,775
And that's why we don't need to fund the VA spiders will mindwipe

1102
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
I think that's

1103
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,591
Kind of the plot of Men In Black

1104
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:16,991
23 actors net worth

1105
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,039
Part of Ben black

1106
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
I saw one

1107
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,087
Sod2

1108
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
Yeah fair enough

1109
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,159
So we got two more clips

1110
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
Cra

1111
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,463
Bratayley

1112
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Like

1113
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:32,607
You water you want to return face even send her to become a hero

1114
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,167
But she's just a little snow

1115
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,239
She's just like

1116
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,311
It is invested at this point has been like 5 times

1117
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,615
She's got an interview

1118
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
I need him

1119
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
To be a source

1120
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,503
Cuz without him I don't have a whole lot of

1121
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,039
Sources that I rely on

1122
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,583
Do that no not like everybody does

1123
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Wake up

1124
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
What I told you

1125
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Before what

1126
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,495
I said earlier which is

1127
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
He is getting ripped

1128
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
Directive

1129
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
How to

1130
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,919
True that he really had a

1131
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Can any Quest

1132
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
Obviously his mind

1133
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,551
Very quickly but he says sometimes

1134
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,831
MC does struggle

1135
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,623
To figure out whether or not

1136
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,903
He's been told

1137
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:28,927
To tell me something

1138
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
You're not when I get

1139
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,719
Hickory close

1140
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
When am I

1141
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,167
You are describing Alliance

1142
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
Called it called buying time

1143
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,311
It's a very convenient way to not answer questions that you

1144
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,127
Figure out how to work into your Lie by didn't like

1145
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,967
Now there's things I've been told I can't tell you

1146
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:55,039
Nets are your cross the line I don't have an answer for that

1147
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,367
Quick enough today

1148
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,183
Let's see if that violates what I'm supposed to

1149
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:05,023
Exactly but I'm f****** time it's so clear as day it's

1150
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,071
Just wake up

1151
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,887
Whatever she says

1152
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
He did not

1153
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,727
Confirm this but he did give me a little

1154
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,543
Side eye to let me know I think

1155
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
He is

1156
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
Confirming

1157
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,895
Exactly what it was that I

1158
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,503
Depressed

1159
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,087
The Dutchman is his ass

1160
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,183
Imagine

1161
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,719
We got this

1162
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,255
Scary is describing

1163
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,327
Quite literally in her interactions

1164
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
Understand what

1165
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,239
No

1166
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
It's sad

1167
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,823
We get to this last clip

1168
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
You really sure

1169
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
You should wise up

1170
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
Young lady

1171
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:59,039
He's still in prison

1172
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,135
His

1173
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
He's such a key player

1174
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,463
Yeah

1175
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
Instead that

1176
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,559
His influence and contacts

1177
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
In the universe

1178
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,119
Would I

1179
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Threatened the powers

1180
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,935
Recipes that are in charge

1181
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Right now and

1182
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
Is there a

1183
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,519
He says that he

1184
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Probably

1185
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
Garner

1186
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Support

1187
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
To take them down

1188
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,759
Charlie the clearest statement he ever made

1189
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
In prison

1190
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
Which is interesting

1191
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
It is enforced

1192
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:43,071
Are you still in prison you're a major player in the entire universe and you're a hero idiot you have friends who

1193
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,631
Who are all these powerful Space Race now

1194
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:52,031
They've been the reason we've had been horribly traumatic

1195
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:56,127
The rest of the world why are you

1196
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,175
Medium security prison

1197
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:02,271
You can't get out of with the help of Raptors or spiders let me answer that question

1198
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
First off by saying

1199
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
I am their enemy

1200
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,695
They want me gone

1201
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,999
Because I am so powerful

1202
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,535
Franklin

1203
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
I could

1204
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,327
Probably

1205
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,863
Get enough support

1206
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,679
Destroy your entire global

1207
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
They are whatever it is

1208
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
If you guys think

1209
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,031
But I mean

1210
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,055
A medium security

1211
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,079
Prison cell

1212
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:30,175
Even though I talk to literally everyone in the f****** universe

1213
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,967
Right orders

1214
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,319
Of course I could

1215
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
Destroyed

1216
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Sure

1217
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,719
I could get the support I need

1218
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:49,375
To save everybody and have a happy ending for the world but I cannot get the support I need to break out of

1219
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,447
Rinky-dink prism

1220
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:59,359
No I was visited by Minerva and artificially intelligent Interstellar aircraft right

1221
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,895
Only I can fly

1222
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:09,343
If Minerva flew over let's say with a raptor in tow Raptor comes down

1223
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,671
Brakes Mark out of prison jumps back up at the Minerva

1224
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
It doesn't

1225
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,767
It's so easy

1226
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,863
Other stuff he's describing that would

1227
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,935
Cakewalk

1228
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,775
You like

1229
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:34,687
Being a background extra in Jurassic World

1230
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:41,599
More clear lake in Mark Richards world like astral projection is a thing that's real

1231
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:47,487
You shouldn't even matter that he's imprisoned he should be able I'm out my body is in here but I'm out all the time

1232
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Why not

1233
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,351
But you should be able to astrally projected beat in studio with Carrie

1234
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:53,887
Question

1235
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
Most powerful people in the world

1236
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Maybe

1237
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
He would teleport

1238
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
One time

1239
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Weirdest

1240
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,871
That's a great point

1241
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
Cuz he wasn't 2:30

1242
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:10,015
No

1243
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,087
It's true Superbad

1244
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:19,487
Indiana prison

1245
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
Mark Richards deceitful ass

1246
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,351
Kerry Cassidy

1247
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,423
Having no idea what to do with it

1248
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
What we learned a little bit I mean

1249
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:34,847
First of all no war is what we think it is but we had a hunch though the case already

1250
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
Eisenhower in the world

1251
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,343
The school still questionable where they came from and what

1252
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,671
I'm really super

1253
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,439
There's art

1254
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,487
Artificial intelligence in all you haven't

1255
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,767
Doing is running some

1256
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
Analysis

1257
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Just like

1258
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:59,167
Grades are bad as mites

1259
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
Goodnight whatever you found out they were mercenaries to begin with

1260
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:14,015
Yes this is like this a I could be like the most rudimentary

1261
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
We have no proof

1262
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,111
From what it said that it's some sort of like

1263
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
Oh yeah

1264
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,927
It couldn't be Kasparov

1265
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,231
It's a chance I'll tell you that right now

1266
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:26,559
This is not a deep thinking of AI

1267
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,607
I think the most important

1268
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,911
He's that there is at least one insta

1269
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
Since that we found

1270
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,751
The Narrative of

1271
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
Project Camelot

1272
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
And Mark Richard

1273
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Being

1274
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
Identical

1275
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
Do something it wanted Alex Jones is fake sources

1276
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
Is pitching as

1277
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
So

1278
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,551
That's fine anyway

1279
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Something I learned

1280
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,343
Who was that

1281
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,391
People who built Angkor Wat

1282
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,535
After being my brain

1283
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Again

1284
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
Want to know without microwave

1285
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,007
Mark Richards has so much

1286
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
To give

1287
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,079
You know it's a scholarship

1288
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,663
Put the microwave oven on the back of

1289
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:18,527
Do they have a way cuz I can't imagine where the spiders holding it like a gun

1290
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,087
They don't have hands

1291
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:28,511
Dino Riders the DeLaGhetto microwave gone on their head

1292
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,535
What is Bailey I've had

1293
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,911
I don't know I will say I do believe it helps

1294
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,471
Ice boat

1295
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
Bulshit

1296
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,895
Just answer

1297
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:52,575
Covid-19 episode about Alex Jones shortly but I wanted to take a little break

1298
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,647
You need to sometimes spiders

1299
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,743
I don't know why it is the only narratives that I

1300
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,303
Like the Raptors of the reptoids I'm over

1301
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,143
Spider leadership never fails

1302
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,471
Ruthless

1303
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:14,335
Spiders no prisoners

1304
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
Which I don't take the Raptors have

1305
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,919
I think they just evolved with mine

1306
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:25,087
Characteristics of a

1307
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
Garlic with those wasps

1308
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
There are those wasps

1309
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,695
Lookin Like lay eggs in you in

1310
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Control your brain

1311
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,631
Bright

1312
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
Burst out of their heads

1313
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,263
What spiders are a much better visual

1314
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,431
Not scary

1315
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:57,599
Amazon website

1316
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,927
College fight.com

1317
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Scribe like

1318
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
The show

1319
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:12,191
Review once again will be in Austin on June 5th

1320
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,615
Go home and tell your mother we're going to be there

1321
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,687
You and I are a little bit

1322
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,711
Long weekend

1323
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
A recording this late

1324
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:31,647
Our episodes

1325
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,951
I feel comfortable admitting

1326
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,327
Fresher than ever real soon

1327
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Let me tell you

1328
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:42,911
BoBoiBoy

1329
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,703
Go f*** yourself nordics

1330
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,031
Wait a second you can't tell an entire race

1331
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,079
Hey if you caused the Holocaust

1332
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871
That's fair I'll give it to you

1333
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
Holding

1334
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,807
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
