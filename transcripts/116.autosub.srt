1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Sit around drink novelty beverages

3
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,696
Scrappy show

4
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
Details

5
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
All right in that case I would like to welcome

6
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
These are foreign policy

7
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
Best bumped up their donation walk status so

8
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
Come to the foreign policy ranks

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,736
I am thank you so much

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,144
Really appreciate it

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,776
So good

12
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Hey congratulations on becoming

13
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,360
Foreign policy wonk

14
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Part of me is like

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,528
Just don't want to hear this clipboard

16
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Be just

17
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
Funniness of Steve pieczenik scabby nose

18
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,208
Is that it'll never grow old

19
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,792
What is a crate

20
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
Perfect

21
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,472
People don't respond to Alex saying like

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
I was always

23
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,616
Like 9/11 I was right about that.

24
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,504
If you know it's even better because Alex

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,624
It never gets that s*** from his gas now never ever like

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,256
Turn it down to go f*** yourself not-so-great you dick

27
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Love it

28
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680
Go to knowledge fight.com

29
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
Quicksupport the show

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,336
As I mentioned the end of the last episode we are trying to bump up the donations $100 this month

31
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
And I'm thrilled to report Within

32
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
One episode we are up

33
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,832
$28 in donation holy so we really think everybody and if you'd like to join in on that

34
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
If we can get

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
That to that Mark if we can reach our goal by the end of

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
January

37
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
We will start releasing

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Documentary

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
Coverage

40
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
I guess Alex Jones's film endgame

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,424
That will be devastating and exhaustive

42
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
For everybody that's true it's a two-and-a-half-hour documentary

43
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Will probably take

44
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
Six seven hours

45
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Very happy with it

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
This will be

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
6

48
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
I'm sorry Jordan today we're going to be going over the

49
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
January 5th 20

50
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
18

51
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Of the Alex Jones Show

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,776
You know we're going to have to get into that we're going to do that thing that everybody does every January was like

53
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm not used to this 2018 and all that stuff no one writes checks anymore

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
But

55
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
I've been fine with it

56
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Just verbally

57
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,952
There I almost said did I do that all the time back and forth and history it's always

58
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
But yeah

59
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
One year older

60
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
One year wise

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
Indeed and Alex

62
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
Is no different

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Do in the Bay area today

64
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
Trying to wrestle with

65
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Revelation

66
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Scents that broke

67
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Since that news broke

68
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,320
And I think there's a lot of angles that are being played

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
I'm really not clear what's going on

70
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,512
Here's my issue with all the angles being

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,839
Is that none of the angles that I have seen

72
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,911
So far are similar to my own which is

73
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
So everyone stupid

74
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,567
Actually a lot of it on Twitter people being very much like

75
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Who cares

76
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
I'm there is some truth to that I think

77
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
For everyone who is unaware we talked about

78
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Michael Wolff

79
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
A noted

80
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
Creative nonfiction writer out of New York covered these social

81
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
Media Elites the New York

82
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
David Sedaris

83
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
Way but probably less funny

84
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
It's straight up a saying

85
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
It's it's it's

86
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Creative nonfiction

87
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
And everybody who is aware of his writing is

88
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Is aware of that

89
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,223
Right it's not yellow journalism cuz he's not trying to

90
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
It's not propaganda

91
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
It's a style of writing

92
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
Play sin magazine original yellow journalist William Ray

93
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,279
Kind of yellow journalism

94
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
They operated for specific

95
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Games

96
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,983
For the most part I mean many of their names or just

97
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
I guess if you

98
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
It's a stretch to me

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
But if you want to go with that I'm going to allow it

100
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
Thank you I'll let you do

101
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
In the aftermath of this

102
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
He's coming out that Michael Wolfe wrote who wrote This Book fire and fury

103
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,207
Pushed out later now it's out

104
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
There was an expert

105
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
Came out that included

106
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
A quote from Steve Bannon

107
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Kushner

108
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Manafort

109
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,287
Restless coyote Russian lawyer

110
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
And in the aftermath of that

111
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Response was

112
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Everyone

113
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Freaked out

114
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
All the Liberals

115
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,927
All the people on Twitter all the commentators freaked out about this

116
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
Right

117
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
No one really took into account that this guy is a great amount

118
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
Bariatric

119
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,823
From Splinter like the Rockers Rudolph's

120
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Situations are always

121
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
Like The Intercept all of those guys were like

122
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Hold on

123
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Right

124
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
People

125
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,135
This is going into by argument that there's no way Trump is not aware of how

126
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Right because he's been covering

127
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
Trump World

128
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Essentially

129
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
Yes so

130
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Duped by this

131
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Stomach

132
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
Okay if you got really serious

133
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Looks like this guy is a liar

134
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
But he doesn't understand why he's a liar

135
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,383
So we didn't entire show about this guy but making up quotes

136
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,015
I'm stuffy just looked at his Wikipedia page and didn't understand the nature of the guys actual writing

137
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
Okay so he did a really terrible job of it

138
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
I'm just like

139
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:27,487
Locate I want I don't want

140
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Look

141
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,583
Good guys are no liar also

142
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
But this guy's a liar

143
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,871
The only person who's doing this right is Rogers

144
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
He is just like I don't want

145
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,991
Nope

146
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
I'm out on Thursday 4th Rodger Stone was on Wednesday

147
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,839
There was but he was like I've been dealing with Michael Wolfe for a long time

148
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
I know what he does

149
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
And Alex just couldn't understand couldn't roll with

150
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
To figure out

151
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
The same time he can go

152
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
I think

153
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Choice

154
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Put out that press release the day that this excerpt leak

155
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,143
For this excerpt was released

156
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Do you think

157
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
Stanford

158
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
Nothing to do with my wind

159
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,991
Put him on the National Security Council

160
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
So like

161
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,183
Stupid because of trump coming out and saying that he's lost his mind

162
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,511
The Narrative or full

163
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,583
Understanding of who Michael Wolff is he could have built it up

164
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Ahead of time with like

165
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Hey guys Let's ignore

166
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
That should have been his play it was it's not an opportunity for him to be like the media are up

167
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Flyers

168
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Because

169
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Is different

170
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
Yeah yeah I am so Alex finds himself in a very strange

171
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Place where he's like

172
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
I can't figure out a different way to handle this

173
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,207
I am so excited to hear Alex

174
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,791
Well it's kind of going back to the well a little bit

175
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
And doing what he does best

176
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
Creative nonfiction response

177
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
I think she's stupid argue that it isn't

178
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Read his response

179
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,479
Great

180
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
So Alex

181
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
On the 5th

182
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
He got into

183
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Studio

184
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
He decided he was going to open his show

185
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
F***** up rant

186
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
And this is gone viral

187
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,143
Around you posted on all the site

188
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,983
And generally we like to ignore the things that everyone else talks about Disney

189
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,591
There's not a whole lot of value in it but in this now I have no idea what you're

190
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
In this case I think it is worthwhile because he does touch on a number of things that are relevant to our examinations of Alex

191
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
Does he start to show at the 10-minute rant

192
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Yeah

193
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
Let's get into it I've not cut anything out of the first

194
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
Commercial break which is

195
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Wall-to-wall viscera

196
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
Okay

197
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
I just put it the segment

198
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
Adjustability

199
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Gear is

200
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,079
You know Donald Trump over the weekend said something that

201
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,431
Madeleine McCann

202
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
Live

203
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
It's so true

204
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
The truth is powerful

205
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
Operate

206
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
History

207
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
Really needs me to win in 2020

208
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
You guys had almost no ratings at a completely imploded

209
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
Is your fake news

210
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Look at the economy look it all up

211
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,671
Optimism

212
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,511
30 sensible policies across the board

213
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
They are just flipping out

214
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,471
So now let's talk about let's talk about a few things first of all

215
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
I think it's a mistake

216
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
To ever look at the news

217
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,639
Maybe a systemic problem that we need to address

218
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
The bad guy

219
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,111
But also

220
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Arguably correct

221
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
That's debatable MSNBC

222
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
These ratings are higher now than they were during the election

223
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
And who's to say how much of an effect

224
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Directly has on that but the Dark Knight territory without Batman there wouldn't be a Joe

225
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Right right

226
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
Whole thing bro now you're looking at Movies allegorical for reality

227
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
Point Behind The Dark Knight

228
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,951
Like it was like that's that's choosing to ignore any Arts allegorical

229
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
Further

230
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Alex's

231
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,143
Sort of contention that Trump like no other politician before operates based on the truth

232
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
Yes isn't ironic thing for him to be talkin about

233
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
I got rid of that election Integrity commission that he had started

234
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,807
Probably voted voter fraud

235
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
Executive order getting rid of that committee late night

236
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
Hoping that no one would notice

237
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
Order that came out

238
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,631
Beaded blamed the state they wouldn't give up there

239
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
It's obvious

240
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
Navigate to sensible policy

241
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
I think you stopped there all of his policies

242
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Are berries

243
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
You know what he wants

244
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,223
Billion dollars to build a wall no rational

245
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Human being with Zia's

246
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Effective

247
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
Be reasonable or c

248
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
Enough money

249
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,303
Ridiculous it might be enough money to build

250
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Expect

251
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,935
If they painted the wall with like Bozo the Clown

252
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
Perfect I'm way on board without advertising

253
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,479
Is just f****** gold making a mistake that would probably

254
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Of course

255
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
So this is the beginning of the ranch

256
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
So far we haven't really take

257
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Turn towards

258
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
You know what why people are interest

259
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
So far it's just a setup of like

260
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,375
Bring it back

261
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
A lot of games in terms of

262
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
Stock market hours

263
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Have been

264
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
These business optimist

265
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Are really just

266
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
I make their speculative by business

267
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
The same time they are based on

268
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
And idea that they will have

269
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Laugh

270
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
And be able to not treat their employees better there will be less regulation governing how

271
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Are they screw us

272
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
The big things

273
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
Whenever anybody talks about the economy going up

274
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Is that

275
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
The economy

276
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
Is going up

277
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,775
So long as we're still in the realm of imagination

278
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
Sure all of the economy going up is

279
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Completely imagine

280
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
I like the stock market

281
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Rising once again

282
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
These are not tied

283
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
Like uber has evaluation of like

284
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
8 billion dollars whatever

285
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
And it's losing money

286
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Floureon that is going to

287
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
Drop-in they're going to explode

288
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
Why did it go up so high

289
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
Because all the trading is done by algorithms like all of this

290
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
Is imaginary money

291
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
And none of it is going to be

292
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
People who work for a living

293
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Brightright

294
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Sooner or later reality is going to hit

295
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
And it's going to hit

296
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
People who work for a living

297
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
We didn't actually gain anything in the economy

298
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,367
Even whenever everybody said the economy growing under Obama

299
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,951
Normal people who work for a living did not actually gain anything

300
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
During those times

301
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
Admittedly

302
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
We got more jobs during that time because it's

303
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
The 2007 Financial

304
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Everybody

305
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,471
Exploded but hey do you remember the 2007 Finance

306
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:15,871
Do you know why that financial crash happened

307
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
So also

308
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,879
I don't think anyone tonight at least the last time I checked on these small business optimism

309
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Most of the

310
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
Composite of a bunch of different fact

311
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
And some of the factors are things like

312
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
Do you think things are going to improve

313
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,959
And there's other ones that are like are you planning on raising inventory

314
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Are you planning on hiring more

315
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,567
Right and those ones that directly affect

316
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
People needing jobs

317
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
They're needing raises

318
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Those are stagnant

319
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
Those has not been growing but the other factors have been growing High Enough

320
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
To make the optimism index

321
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,159
Go way up right and that to me is sort of artificial

322
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
In terms of

323
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Even that statistic

324
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Because I think that you would look for

325
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
Would be are you raising inventory

326
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,399
Are you hiring more people do you have plans to expand

327
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Do you think people are going to buy more

328
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,823
I don't remember if that was actually you know what I'm saying

329
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,687
Do you and I where we employees of these small businesses that are being indexed

330
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Those things aren't necessarily really change

331
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
But

332
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
You know statistically Alex's

333
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Totally lying

334
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,415
He's just not really dealing with what the reality of those dead

335
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
That's me

336
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,559
That's not what people are

337
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
No president

338
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
In the

339
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
Change over. Of the

340
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
The first two years

341
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,239
Really has any actual effect

342
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
Exactly

343
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Who is really had a

344
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
Huge effect on it was Obama's

345
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
We bypass

346
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Sing Batman

347
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
Almost trillion dollars

348
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Otherwise it's just

349
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
Previous administration and its policy

350
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
Overrun

351
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,583
Ears it's like

352
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
Like it's the same s*** that happens

353
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,727
Reagan had nothing to do with anyway

354
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
Let's get to look into greener pastures

355
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
We can figure out why

356
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Did this ramp go viral

357
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,455
Wolf

358
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Portsmouth's tuning

359
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,623
He's news reports with outright fabrication

360
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
That's not what that what you hang ornaments on a Christmas tree

361
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
You festoon ornaments on the car

362
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
Christmas Mountain

363
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
No no

364
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
No way to know if any of its

365
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,103
Headline news from aol.com

366
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
And

367
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,479
Great the headline is Michael Wolfe says he can't be sure if parts of his

368
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
Explosive Trump book are true

369
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,087
Yes that Alex didn't read this article because

370
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
In the second paragraph

371
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,951
Just real close to the top

372
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,351
It says Michael Wolff

373
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Reliability of

374
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Specific

375
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Interests of its pages

376
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
A number of his sources

377
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,519
She says we're definitely lying to him

378
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,847
Well some offered accounts that flatly contradicts those of others

379
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
They were nonetheless included the Vivid account of the West Winds working

380
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,039
In a process wolf describes as allowing the reader to judge whether they are true

381
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,415
As long as there is that caveat I don't think that it's necessarily wrong

382
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,535
Did Alex doesn't realize what the headline mean

383
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Michael Wolff came out and said

384
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
These f****** were lying to me

385
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Which is

386
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,727
He's not saying

387
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,799
I don't know if I made stuff up which is what Alex wants the audience

388
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:02,687
Is absolutely a complete misrepresentation and Ally if you are

389
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
You should absolutely quote the ones who are

390
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Directly

391
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Contradicting

392
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Other people

393
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
That's an important

394
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,879
Thing to put in the book

395
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
I don't know the context of how we reported it or anything

396
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
But if I were doing

397
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Story along those

398
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Like like what he

399
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
He's doing right

400
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
There I would

401
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
You heard

402
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Look at what this guy said

403
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,055
Look at what that guy said

404
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Who might be telling

405
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,919
What their agenda

406
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,759
I haven't read the book at all but I read that long excerpt

407
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
New York mag I believe

408
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
The one about Trump not wanting

409
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
And

410
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Have been saying

411
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,351
The entire time I thought the writing was a bit

412
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
Flowers

413
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
To be like

414
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Ready

415
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
Keep going back to Sedaris but like

416
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
He is

417
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:09,247
Sort of archetype of creative nonfiction

418
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
Chinese writing

419
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
But it's in order to

420
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
To create this ambiance

421
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
And like the spiritual truth whatever

422
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,280
And that is the sense that I got from that Decent New York Magazine that there was a lot of Cousin It

423
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Hidden

424
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Assumption

425
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
On the level of Alex Jones

426
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
He says Megyn Kelly

427
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,080
Thinks she's ugly and wants to go to NBC

428
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Can you pretending that he's a truth-teller

429
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
And like I literally never lie to you and that's up

430
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,184
And what he does could be the biggest piece of s*** in the world I have no idea

431
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
You earlier I was like

432
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
Give me a reason to read this book

433
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
And that I can't think of any reason my response was

434
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
I don't know I don't know if there's any value in it

435
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
I think it could just reinforce a lot of

436
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Ideas with

437
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,128
People already have an issue with every story that's come out

438
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Has complete

439
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
Wheatley corroborated what

440
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
People want to be true

441
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,296
And there's not there's nothing to say but that's not

442
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
True

443
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,696
But I don't know I worry I worry about the the the mentality of getting

444
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
Your beliefs

445
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Affirm

446
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
When.

447
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Source of that affirmation

448
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Is not

449
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Necessarily

450
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
Strictly credible

451
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
If somebody who has a history of

452
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
Things that you want

453
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Right right

454
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,152
I've looked at because he has been accused of fabricating quotes a number of times throughout his

455
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Career

456
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,552
I looked at some of them and tell him like he's probably lying about this or like

457
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Oh they don't want

458
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
Bestowed

459
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,696
There are probably at least there at least a few examples

460
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Because he wrote a book called burn rate

461
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,840
It was about like his time a text later.

462
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
Text startup type stuff and he's talking about

463
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Joe's world doing coke

464
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
In like we're assholes

465
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Ancient like that

466
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
Some of their quotes were

467
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Challenged

468
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Obviously

469
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
Obviously they do Coke and say dumb

470
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,344
Yeah I don't find that hard to believe but you know there's a lot of quotes

471
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
Both ended up just a random whenever they feel like it

472
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Which is a delay

473
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
So you have these guys who are like

474
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,128
I don't know it says a lot.

475
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Medpoint

476
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
Just come out and then like I did

477
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
Or the fact that

478
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Trump put up at 6

479
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
His denial is the best

480
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,976
Proof that was what I was trying to get to it right when we were starting

481
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
The beginning of

482
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
This was talking about everyone's

483
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Treating it as if it's

484
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Real one that's

485
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
You don't need to respond

486
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
Alex plays himself a little bit

487
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,520
Not getting it together and figuring out how to approach

488
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
The narrative

489
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
And I think that they could have guess

490
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,736
And what that has to mean to me I think is that wolf was around

491
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Trump is worried

492
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Did those quotes

493
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,672
And a lot of stuff that's going to be in that are true

494
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Absolute but I don't know I dates it's tough to wargame

495
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:37,376
Summer trousseau March

496
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
You verify that it the very least

497
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Some Archer

498
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
You indicate that you're shook

499
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
You like

500
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
You at least

501
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Show your cards that you're worth

502
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Yes

503
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,944
When it when in all reality all you have to do is

504
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
That's all you have to do

505
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
Even better if you were just like

506
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
This is

507
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
This guy is beneath me

508
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
I don't need to respond

509
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
Are you guys aware of this guy's career like please I'm not going to dignify that with a response

510
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Like oh

511
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
Probably would behave

512
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
Advise to him by lawyers

513
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,288
Or something like that or maybe not even lawyers people around him being like get ahead of the

514
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
The story get ahead of this

515
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
I think

516
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Jaundice

517
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
I'll do whatever is necessary

518
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
To get the story

519
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
Again is about

520
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,744
Wolf in journalist clothing

521
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,608
Disingenuous

522
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,264
Guys go to Google images and Brian stelter smiling

523
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
It is the most disingenuous wolf-like demon face

524
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:56,480
I've ever seen and then you look at me

525
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Oh boy

526
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
That makes perfect

527
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,368
There's a couple things I want to bring into a real

528
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
Sharp Focus

529
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
First

530
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Alex Jones has Brian stelter

531
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,840
We've covered this in the past he called him mr. Mister creepy that was the guy with the mustache

532
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,168
But he went on that long Jack talked about how Brian stelter wants to

533
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,032
Get you an advantage it like that

534
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,568
That's not surprising

535
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
What is the present to me is that for month

536
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
He's been planning on doing a special report about Brian stelter smile

537
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
He didn't say

538
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
I don't know if selters been in

539
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
On the scene

540
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
4 years of the thing I think

541
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
Have you come to my wearing

542
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
I'm going to be honest I'm going back and forth

543
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
Pictures of Michael Wolff

544
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Brian stelter

545
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
He's got an argument

546
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,984
Cuz they're all

547
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Is oddly similar

548
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Alright fine

549
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
Anyway

550
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Deeper into this

551
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
Enjoy

552
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Kicks off internet

553
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:05,600
Oh my God

554
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,416
Movie cover

555
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:14,304
Seriously Steve scarier looking at it the clown I mean would you let your children

556
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,632
Psychopath psychopath

557
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
I mean

558
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,576
And then you look at the photos of wolf smiling

559
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,512
So I can change the still image photo of them smile the same way with that Power Trip look in his eyes

560
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
It's a Google Images

561
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
World-journal

562
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
That's his cover

563
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
A10e

564
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,520
I believe he is related to

565
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,128
I would literally

566
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
So I mean

567
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
This is boring to us

568
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,264
Everyone everyone really loves because it's

569
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,336
It's so much what Alex Tarzan evenheat

570
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
Can't get past like

571
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Are you going to

572
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Keep reminding you about the

573
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
This is about two men smile

574
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,600
He never can really even address things differently than they think they're better than us

575
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,160
They think they're better than they're so smart

576
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
Blah blah blah

577
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,488
It's all it's all so

578
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
Insecure

579
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
That's all that's all he's got

580
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
It is it is fun

581
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,192
It's hard to see what goes viral and

582
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
How much

583
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,312
Like even currently we're just like

584
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,296
Okay we'll find we do this so much

585
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,136
Or you could listen to

586
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,744
You could do that I would say that there is still some things that are worth it and pretty fun

587
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Within this viral rant

588
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,376
It Bears mentioning like this is

589
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Not like

590
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
This is par for the course

591
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,264
Watch the show Dexter

592
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
I'm Petty

593
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,432
I'm worried that I'm not that smart

594
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,040
I lie all the time and therefore I'm worried that this other guy is lying

595
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
His psychology boersma

596
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Yes

597
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Yveltal

598
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Thank you

599
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
The evil and then Alex makes

600
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
The claim that I

601
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Strongly disagree

602
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
Wolfenstein

603
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
Better than you I'm smarter than you

604
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Piece of garbage

605
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Office wall

606
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,496
Because I want people to know

607
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Believable

608
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,272
You guys still haven't found the one if it's a body shot of

609
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
And he's looking down with that

610
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
Just that disingenuous

611
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
Predator laptop

612
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,816
Not even hiding the fact that I hate everybody and I'm a piece of crap and I want to abuse

613
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,216
He thinks you don't know

614
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,664
No that's not it

615
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,600
And these are photos

616
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,584
I tried to jump photos like this

617
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
I can't pull it off

618
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,424
Cuz the eyes vehicle

619
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:43,104
Google pictures of Alex Jones and look at his creepy as I

620
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,552
Absolutely going to hear it I don't even need to see the video of

621
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,856
Just like these I probably look creepy while he's

622
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
Premise of like

623
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,000
I can't even get myself to look evil like these f***

624
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,864
Is so flawed

625
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,448
Any Google image search you have Alex Jones

626
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
You're going to be

627
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
A real disaster

628
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Okay now hold on

629
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
Devastating

630
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,640
Let's try and figure out

631
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Let's party

632
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
First off that sentence

633
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
I love it

634
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
What that liquid

635
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
So the first part of that sentence

636
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Is

637
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,416
They know you can see it in their eyes when they're looking at you

638
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
I'm lying to you

639
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
I'm telling you a false

640
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
But then Ulta

641
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
There's a disingenuous

642
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Of you don't know

643
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
Reindeer games

644
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
What even is he described

645
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,152
F****** letting off steam

646
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,224
Is somebody who's eating you what time

647
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,624
Lying to you about thinking that you don't know he's mad that he got launched off on an errand

648
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,952
About Steve Bannon losing his mind and s*** like that

649
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
That's going to make his jobs

650
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,280
So much more difficult now

651
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Because

652
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
I think he's better about Michael Wolfe I think he's bitter that he didn't do his research on him before he committed to

653
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Abandoned lost

654
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
Does mind and has arms

655
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
Security around him at all times

656
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,432
He has a paramilitary troops guarding him and s*** like that

657
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,784
I think he's mad about that I think he's probably a little bit mad at Trump

658
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
That

659
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Because it boxes him into a corner

660
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Now I don't think

661
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
He came.

662
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Credibly

663
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Site Breitbart

664
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,840
What are the major allies

665
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,400
So that means that the entirety of Breitbart

666
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:49,312
Calls into question the narratives the Breitbart pushed that Alex jumped before

667
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
He calls into question Alex

668
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,712
His credibility and he knows that if anyone's paying attention that is a thought that they have to have

669
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:01,344
He's like hey Aunt Bannon is this manipulative and this f****** crazy

670
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
He didn't just get there overnight

671
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
Like he's always been

672
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,280
And therefore look at the narratives that we're coming out of Breitbart

673
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
Think about whether they're true or not

674
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
Think about whether or not you Alex Jones

675
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,704
Got sued by humping hulakai

676
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,104
Chobani yogurt because of stories that you doubled down on that were published in bright

677
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,920
Now is that does that give you any pause

678
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:30,016
Do you know look at that slightly different Alex Emerick Jones

679
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,064
Do you realize how

680
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
Blade

681
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,136
You are taking the second

682
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:42,304
As we both know is not a possible thing for the World of Alex Jones

683
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,608
He's going to do another Breitbart story

684
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:51,008
Tomorrow probably does on this show probably

685
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:00,480
Derita right now I've got some coming out of my collared shirt

686
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
I don't I don't understand this level of stupid

687
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,880
I'd like legitimately if we have a source that we really like

688
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,184
And that it came out like other persons.

689
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,720
Probably

690
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Hey sorry we

691
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
We covered that South

692
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
At the same time calling

693
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Question

694
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
The things that were laid

695
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
The track that was laid because of

696
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
Stories from the stores

697
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,824
We have a source that we really like I feel like we kind of hate

698
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
I like primary sources

699
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
No I mean lunch credible sources

700
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,416
I do I take everything with a grain of salt

701
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,816
Do you like do you like Greenwald a little bit

702
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
The number of times

703
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
And I think he's wrong

704
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
As much as he's right like app

705
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:02,432
With a grain of salt early early on on the show I think in particular probably gave too much credibility

706
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,528
Some stuff that it had been on Twitter but the dress that at the time

707
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
Apologized

708
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
That's what Alex is not doing even people that we've talked about before like a Sarah kendzior

709
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
But at the same time I'm going to take everything

710
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
She says with a grain of salt

711
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Yeah

712
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
Absolutely everybody who is predict

713
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
Frustrates in

714
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,800
Predictive predictive

715
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Punditry

716
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
I guess if you want to call it that

717
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
It seems unfair but

718
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Maybe

719
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
If you want to call it that it's

720
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,248
There's the problem of the future

721
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,856
But you can even always have things be right or wrong if you're predicting

722
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
That's why I

723
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,464
We're at the end of last year you asked me for years predict

724
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
I think I still mail

725
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Probably

726
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,704
Alex Jones

727
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Not nearly done

728
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:11,296
Different prompts

729
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:19,488
What are you talkin about I know that I I saw that there are indications

730
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
Doesn't mean that everyone

731
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Pick up on the rent

732
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
No it's not

733
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,704
It's okay everyone has a superpower where they can tell if you're sick or lying

734
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
Now there are little cute

735
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,872
Genuine smile like there's something about the eyebrows

736
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
And whatever way I'm certain there is

737
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
Cuz I don't give a

738
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
The area of study is always been like

739
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,392
Interesting but at the same time I don't want to use it

740
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,792
Body language specialist they have on TV

741
00:37:54,048 --> 00:38:00,192
Boil down interaction to that level

742
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,032
Shut your supercomputer

743
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:08,640
Your first shallow approximation

744
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
Present

745
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
Broadcast

746
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,768
Oh my gosh

747
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,304
Hell on Earth

748
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,912
He's struggling now to try and figure out what to talk about other than stelter is weird

749
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
Almost

750
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
Let's close

751
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,896
Sorry eat pivots from near orgasmic moaning

752
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,504
He wants to run your life he wants to control every aspect of your life

753
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,088
He is a cowardly degenerate

754
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Shaq

755
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Anti Human

756
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
Crash

757
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,000
I like a man with him before my father

758
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
Yes

759
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,168
He's going to play the time to pray is it a pledge

760
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:09,568
Brian stelter wants to control everything

761
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,968
High School erbil

762
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
You like

763
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,440
I don't think he wants to rule the world have been dreaming about disabling and

764
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,000
Destroying the welfare states in college

765
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,072
Weird thing to dream about that's also a

766
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
It's ambitious

767
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
Literal

768
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,640
Demon spawn of the pit of Hell

769
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
And you know what is better than you if you keep letting it

770
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
Pittsburgh

771
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:58,720
Smiling

772
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
.

773
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,888
Devil worshipping

774
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,496
I see you in a minute

775
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
You really have a choice of

776
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
Just made your bed

777
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
This is not like an impressive moral stand

778
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Against

779
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
Brian stelter

780
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,888
At the same time like

781
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,496
What are you saying is like these Smiles reveal the Demonic Force that's behind them

782
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,080
So when he says the Brian stelter runs the schools and run at the bank

783
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
He's talking about the demon that possesses

784
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,224
We have to get into like a really

785
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
Like

786
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,928
But we really have to get into is this gets

787
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
It's a frenia because

788
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Really close to David Icke

789
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,096
In terms of David Icke saying the people of shape-shifting lizard and what have you

790
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
Whenever he

791
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
David Icke we got a divorce

792
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,240
One of the grounds for divorce was that his wife was a lizard

793
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
That

794
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,872
No fault because I feel like

795
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:24,736
I feel like grounds for unlike I don't see is a lizard that is kind of deceptive

796
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,832
I don't know how England's laws work so I can't comment on that

797
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,416
But like Daddy's bed is the sort of mentality that Alex is manifest

798
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,000
Anybody who's against us ice via demon inside them

799
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
That's really f***** up

800
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
What really no way for us to operate as a society

801
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Okay

802
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,752
What is much as we as much as we clown on Alexandra

803
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,872
No never never never go to that extent

804
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
Psychological

805
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Eve

806
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,479
Damaged

807
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
From his childhood you probably brain damage depending on

808
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,951
Disorder Oppositional Defiant Disorder or he's a psycho

809
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,023
Don't break the Goldwater rule

810
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,327
I think the broader rule is

811
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
The window

812
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
Professionals

813
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703
I just I really I really resent the

814
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,751
I really don't like that sort of

815
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Approach

816
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,079
Cuz it's a dangerous thing it's a dangerous game to play

817
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
Cuz you can just apply to any

818
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,991
And almost anybody has an unflattering picture of them that you could dig up somewhere where they look

819
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
Evil Uno

820
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,343
Especially with Facebook now just get on someone's Facebook

821
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
You can find some

822
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
Crazy pictures back

823
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
I feel like I don't have any

824
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Pictures where I look

825
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
Evil so much

826
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
More is like

827
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
If you get me from the right angle

828
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,143
And the way my hair is parted I look kind of like app

829
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
Like that

830
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Evil

831
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,007
Evil Pimp

832
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,055
I do look like an evil penis

833
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
To drive you going to just jump into freaky

834
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
Hangout about demon

835
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,247
Disingenuous

836
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,111
Perpetrator

837
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:17,375
Will pay

838
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,775
You'll understand me know what you think of me

839
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,935
Godfrey

840
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
That is something that could be tossed aside as

841
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
But as we know from listening to

842
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
Genuinely believe that the globalist

843
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,063
Drink children's blood to harvest a different Chrome

844
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,623
And get high off of it which of course is

845
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:17,023
Apparently and also an archaic anti-semitic card coming back into effect

846
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
They're coming for a women

847
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,447
And now is probably a good time for me to bring up the Michael Wolff is Jewish

848
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,775
And now is another good time for me to bring up

849
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,591
Alex thinks that Brian stelter is Jewish

850
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,711
He was raised a Christian is now an atheist

851
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
His wife is Jewish

852
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:41,599
I was wearing Merida in a Jewish ceremony

853
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
And I don't think that that's a coincidence

854
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,023
I think that Alex when he's talking about these people looking evil

855
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,071
I think he's responding

856
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
Two very smitten

857
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,655
Archetypical

858
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
Facial features in the lights

859
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Yeah

860
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
That sounds right

861
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
I think that's what this is all about

862
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Freeway

863
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,151
Alex

864
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,503
The time to be conscious level level of 10 minutes

865
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:15,903
At the top of the Show screaming about them being demons slipping into their drunken are children's blood kind of s***

866
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
White why is it still touring

867
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,559
Does he have a smile that like Michael wolf

868
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
That's it

869
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,191
No I know but the few things that are

870
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:33,055
Judgmental of trump in the past because he works for CNN who As We Know

871
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
But I don't think it's a coincidence that the rent is going on isn't substantiv about wolf at all

872
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
He looks evil

873
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:46,111
And that links him to Brian stelter who also looks evil

874
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
If you even said

875
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
They could be related you looked at pictures of them

876
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,023
What you're responding to is also

877
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
Fairly Jewish

878
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,935
Facial trait you might have been a little bit

879
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:06,335
Your version is harmful and think they could be related

880
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,919
Facial features that's not my fault Brian stelter isn't Jewish but

881
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,247
I think Alex is operating officer

882
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
I don't know

883
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
Concerned

884
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:22,207
You shouldn't be concerned about the fact that's probably what's motivating the Demonic vitriol that Alec

885
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,791
And the fact that he's not addressing any of the real issue

886
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
About wolf

887
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,423
If he was really just mad about wolf being a liar and trying to take out his braids

888
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
There's a lot more

889
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
Valuable approaches

890
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,615
I quite frankly if he were just to go over

891
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
His career

892
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,991
If you were to address the idea that this guy is a creative nonfiction writer Bay

893
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
I know you spent his life

894
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,111
Manufacturer manufacturing stories that are

895
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,255
Spiritually accurate but not literally accurate

896
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,839
A lot of narratives about like we should just not believe this guy

897
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,143
He has an agenda he could do any of those things

898
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
The fact that he's focusing

899
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,983
Sing almost exclusively on appearance

900
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,775
And relating it to Demons

901
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,823
I'm in relating Demons 2

902
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:18,271
They're drunk on our children blood those things are connected in his brain this appearance

903
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:24,159
Is a sign of a demon within you that wants to drink our children's blood

904
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,951
That is inexorable in my mind

905
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Now connected

906
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
Not to come to Alex defense

907
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,583
Because it was as We Know

908
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
That's not a thing I like to do

909
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
But

910
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,983
Generally speaking Alex goes after everybody's of

911
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,799
True but often it's like they're ugly

912
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,847
Like with Megyn Kelly he's like she's ugly

913
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,943
It's not that she's a demon and wants to drink your children's blood

914
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,527
Nobody's done that

915
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Right

916
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,367
Andy and disregard at like I think

917
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
I think that's just

918
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
More of his go-to move

919
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,535
Anytime he feels challenged by anybody intellectually

920
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,327
To cut them down appearance

921
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
You're not wrong you're not wrong

922
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,191
I think that I might I might be

923
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,031
Drawing to sharpen connection

924
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,591
Making me I would never make the argument that Alex's

925
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Is aware that this is what he's doing

926
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,711
I just think that it is such a piece of his

927
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Serta worldview

928
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
Yeah can't get away from it

929
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
I don't think that Alex

930
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,183
Literally believe like I believe this but I don't think he knows

931
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:36,351
I'm certain that he doesn't understand where these narrative come from

932
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
Anything maybe

933
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Just because I don't

934
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
Is time

935
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,215
I mixed all of his hate

936
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
To specifically single out

937
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
No but I

938
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,615
What I would but I would posit is that

939
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
He doesn't have the time because if

940
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
It would be king

941
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
Construct so much of what he believed

942
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
Right if you have the time to look into like what

943
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
What do I think that these

944
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,159
Elites drink children's blood scare them first

945
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:06,047
I need like little Google little Google

946
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Something

947
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,935
William of Norwich if he were to do that

948
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,751
He would only have two possible outcomes

949
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,799
One would be ocean

950
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,359
So much of this is based on this blood libel s***

951
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:24,479
I got it I got to deal with this more realistically you would have to be like

952
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
S***

953
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
1400

954
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
Oh my God

955
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,207
I meant he'd have to turn into David Duke now that would be fun

956
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
Bright

957
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:41,375
I mean no be negative but if all the sudden on his show as a revel Revelation moment

958
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,959
Alright

959
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:51,359
Let's find out where this chick come out of the closet

960
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:56,223
Alex just say is that we've known anti-Semitic

961
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
If it's early open we can all deal

962
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,255
Announce the time to make clear that Angie

963
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,095
Semitism and being gay are not related at all

964
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:18,495
Let's let's let's

965
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,591
Everybody else knows that we're kind of against

966
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
I'm going to go

967
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,919
100%

968
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
Circle back to this Ranch

969
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:37,695
I forgot I forgot I was so caught up in the the children's blood what have you that I forgot

970
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,743
The true comedy

971
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,119
Girl games

972
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,799
You're so funny

973
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
Bueller's Day Off

974
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,503
You've done it again

975
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
Amazon Prime now

976
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
How to find the photo wolf

977
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,023
Author of the day feel about you

978
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,751
Will and strength against people and recognizing evil and letting know you understand

979
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,503
Ocho real faces

980
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:41,183
How they just absolutely love to hurt Innocents they just rub their hands together

981
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,447
Steven right there goes back to the protocols of the Elders of Zion

982
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
In terms of his conception of

983
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
The globalist so

984
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,847
We could do this everyday whenever recover anything

985
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,503
It is valuable to bring up that the destruction of the family lying to everybody

986
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:10,111
The globalist New World Order conception

987
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,183
That is crafted from the fraudulent text

988
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Language arts

989
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
Because even at my worst

990
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
Anime

991
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
The only

992
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
People I can

993
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,263
Think of hoodoo Delight

994
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
That kind of

995
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,079
Archer RV

996
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,431
Globalstar serial killers

997
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Even like

998
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,039
In general Psychopaths

999
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:43,391
Right are murdering us all but it's

1000
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,439
Like care about there

1001
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,255
Blazer

1002
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,815
I don't think the same rate is anyone

1003
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,887
There are people who are psychopaths

1004
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:57,215
Through and through

1005
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
Like you can't

1006
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:04,639
Do I sort of exploitative job whatever

1007
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,991
Liking Jon Ronson psychopath test I would probably a higher percentage

1008
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
In banking and

1009
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,879
But I still don't think they Delight in

1010
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
Torture

1011
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
In the same way that sir

1012
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,719
Serial killers

1013
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:24,095
A lot of psychopaths in the general population who just like

1014
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Don't give a s***

1015
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
You know like that's okay

1016
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
Yeah I agree

1017
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,543
I don't know what I was going to say

1018
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,615
Not a robot

1019
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
How do I

1020
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,247
Build their own Universe of fraud this is a compendium of there

1021
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,551
Abomination desolation

1022
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
That's a good rifle

1023
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
Not really

1024
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,487
Explosive

1025
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,519
Anyway here's the alto

1026
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,055
What I have heard about it

1027
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,103
Trump at a certain point they're like

1028
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,151
You know all he does is read the headline

1029
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,759
That's why

1030
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,855
There is there is that thing it was from that excerpt where

1031
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Trump was

1032
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,951
Quoted as saying you didn't know John Boehner was

1033
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
And that's not realistic

1034
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,839
There's one there's one point where I believe Rodger Ailes

1035
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,143
Suggested Boehner is H

1036
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Staff

1037
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:34,239
Remember the band trumpet

1038
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Who is that

1039
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,079
And I don't think that that can possibly be true

1040
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
Eat like I could

1041
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
See that being true in more of like a

1042
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,919
Sarcastic kind of

1043
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,247
Incentive like through even is that

1044
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,599
Probably if you're taking that out of context

1045
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,879
You could see that as like

1046
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:56,255
Him being a doddering old I think it's I think I'm impossible to

1047
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,047
Assertive look at that

1048
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,839
Literally true

1049
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:05,471
Like psychic doesn't know

1050
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,055
Yeah I don't I don't know babe I just

1051
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
These are real

1052
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,711
Bring up

1053
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Conception of globalist

1054
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
2 Psychopaths

1055
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
I'm sure it like that

1056
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
Year especially in

1057
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
I'm a couple months

1058
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,159
Before 2018 hit

1059
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
I've been reading a lot of

1060
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,487
Primary globalist Tech

1061
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,791
Yes but Alex Jones puts out as like

1062
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,863
These are evil come to the conclusion

1063
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
What's the correct

1064
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
I read

1065
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,471
Multiple reports from the club of Rome

1066
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
Yeah I've read

1067
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,311
Most of ecoscience fees

1068
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,871
16 hundred page book by John pee holder

1069
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
I've read

1070
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,687
How is other thing

1071
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
Sabri group rosinski book

1072
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,831
Right I've read some writings by like a singer

1073
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,647
And was one of the things that I'm coming away

1074
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:01,279
No I'm coming away from it with is

1075
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
Actually a growing

1076
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Respect

1077
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
4

1078
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
Piccolo

1079
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,959
Will not the global split people in charge like

1080
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,287
I'm coming away from it with a very

1081
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
Expanded respect

1082
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
For how difficult choices

1083
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:23,039
And how big the world is and how are they especially like we talked about this I think a little bit before but

1084
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,599
The club of Rome one of their big things is

1085
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
They look at the world's problems

1086
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Interconnect

1087
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,999
And how is he work on one problem often you can hurt another prop

1088
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,303
And when you look at the world from that sort of

1089
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Holistic

1090
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Review

1091
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
It becomes

1092
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,447
Choice it becomes really difficult to

1093
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
For certain position

1094
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,543
Promises of the cereal

1095
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
Route and then you don't

1096
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,967
They generally don't advocate for a certain position are the things that could happen when

1097
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
XY or scabbing

1098
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
And it's

1099
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
Fascinating to me

1100
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,367
It makes me feel much more like we're in good hands

1101
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
To that level of analysis

1102
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,975
And I couldn't

1103
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,791
Do that

1104
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
The the

1105
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:12,191
The ultimate failure of the opposite effect on me that you would want to have

1106
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,519
Kind of the failure of what Trump really is

1107
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,287
He thinks

1108
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:22,175
It's just a guy who can do a thing right and that's just not how it works

1109
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,455
I do an onion

1110
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:28,319
I think I I think I can tell you a lot of solutions to problem

1111
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
But if I were to apply a solution

1112
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
To April

1113
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
That would almost certainly

1114
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,487
Fuk up another issue

1115
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
Which

1116
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
GE variable ABCD

1117
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,167
Variable

1118
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Which is what

1119
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:49,567
Which is what Obama does did very well

1120
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,871
Certain Solutions

1121
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
The way that

1122
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,431
Would have been perhaps

1123
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Best anime

1124
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,087
As I've read some

1125
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Conservative

1126
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,135
Publication

1127
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,207
Complaints about

1128
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Pretty similar thing

1129
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:07,999
Things there

1130
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
Like I just

1131
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Agree with

1132
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,559
Position

1133
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,887
Yeah but there is certainly not nearly as evil as Alex paint them out to be

1134
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,447
Write like even the project for a New American Century

1135
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Documents

1136
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
But if you actually go read it

1137
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Convince

1138
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,199
That most of their intention wasn't

1139
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
2

1140
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:32,319
Create a better situation where the United States could help the world

1141
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,855
I don't know if

1142
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,391
I don't I don't think it's proof

1143
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,951
Alright

1144
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:42,815
There are a lot of really f***** up things I can find

1145
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
I don't I think that

1146
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
I think they generally

1147
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
I don't know

1148
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,287
It's weird that I'm starting to have a trust of government

1149
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,591
But again these aren't really necessarily the government

1150
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:58,687
Nongovernmental organizations

1151
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Actually been coming

1152
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,551
Don but have

1153
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,879
Been starting to respect

1154
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,439
Trump's position on North Korea

1155
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:15,071
I know it's very wild

1156
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,423
Just like Nixon's possession of

1157
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,239
You want crazy

1158
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
I'll show you f****** crazy

1159
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,103
Oh yeah

1160
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,967
There is a certain extent of

1161
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Maybe

1162
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,783
Just call their f****** Bluff

1163
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,575
Like that could be a things like

1164
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,671
I don't know like the the issue with that is that it's so high risk

1165
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
ATMs

1166
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
It seems in

1167
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
0 room 4

1168
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,143
Is over

1169
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
You're all in and

1170
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
Do you have a loser hand

1171
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:02,943
I disagree with you coming around on it

1172
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,527
Coming around on it should be a very qualified position

1173
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,831
I think I am starting to see

1174
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,391
Even by Axel

1175
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,207
Because it's clearly by accident there's no

1176
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
There's no like

1177
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,767
Position behind

1178
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
I've got a bigger dick than you

1179
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Right

1180
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,607
Same time

1181
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,655
Also that really pissed Alex off

1182
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,007
Everyone talking about how those tweets were really about Trump today

1183
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:30,847
Really pissed Alex all good like 5-10 minutes

1184
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,871
It's talking about how

1185
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Come on man

1186
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,503
That's not that's why you trying to make this about sexism

1187
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:45,439
Also everybody

1188
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:52,607
That is a paraphrase quote from

1189
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,567
Crazy

1190
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,271
I agree that there may be some validity to calling Bluffs and what-have-you but at the same time where do you get after

1191
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,879
You call that bluff you don't just the situation doesn't become stabilized

1192
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,671
The only way you can call the bluff really is

1193
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,719
To attack attack then

1194
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:25,119
There is no block

1195
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Good idea

1196
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,703
I'm saying that there are that I am starting

1197
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Toosii

1198
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751
Again like you said

1199
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,055
Certain merits concept

1200
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:38,175
They're not

1201
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,991
Because I think that actually what's going on

1202
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,015
Is

1203
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,343
Partially what you're talking about but also also partially

1204
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
A maintenance of

1205
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
To the status quo

1206
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,999
Because I think with this like war of words that he's having over Twitter

1207
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
Antagonizing

1208
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,303
Of Kim Jeong Hoon

1209
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
What you have is

1210
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,399
A maintenance of the sort of

1211
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:03,007
Attention that we have in the world with these B Rogue state

1212
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:07,871
It wants to attack

1213
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:14,271
And you know we can't really do anything about it cuz they're going to

1214
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,807
Has lived with us spent

1215
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,903
The Cold War

1216
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,487
He's not addressing the situation he's just escalating that status

1217
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,583
Is going to be all of us scared all the time

1218
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
He's going to say the wrong thing

1219
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:38,335
What you're saying is that this is simply a more public version of mutually assured destruction

1220
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,639
That you would have seen in you no lates

1221
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,431
Sixties with the

1222
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,455
Quote Rush

1223
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,223
Russian Menace

1224
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,111
Somewhat yeah but I also think Skittles be like

1225
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
I got a bigger on Twitter I still don't think anyone's going to pop off like I still don't think

1226
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,839
Either Trump or Moon

1227
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
Is going to

1228
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Nuke anybody

1229
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:06,495
Well it has nothing to do with those two

1230
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,871
And everything to do with what happened in Russia multiple times of just like

1231
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,687
We're going to prepare for this eventuality

1232
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
Then there's some kind of

1233
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,551
Glitch or whatever rights low-level guy

1234
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,575
Is just like

1235
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
I was told to push this button

1236
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,207
And when you're in a regime like North Korea.

1237
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
Much less chance

1238
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,791
That they are going to be as restrained

1239
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,559
Ivy Russian

1240
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
Save the world

1241
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:37,983
Well we know of for this singular Russian

1242
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,383
Didn't happen more than 145

1243
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
Probably happened between 4 and 6

1244
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
Like that kind of

1245
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
So

1246
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,855
So that the final four accidents is very high

1247
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
It's it's

1248
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
You know that trickle-down effect

1249
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
Everybody is

1250
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,231
Italy on Red Alert

1251
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,999
And always afraid

1252
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
Constantly on Red Alert

1253
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
Eventually you get a

1254
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
Adrenaline

1255
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,727
Exactly

1256
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,263
That is something that is very valid

1257
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,543
That should be discussed more

1258
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,359
Victor but I still think

1259
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,895
But when I look at Trump

1260
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
His behavior

1261
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,455
But at the same time

1262
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,015
The function of it really doesn't change

1263
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:28,415
The status quo with North Korea it just makes everyone more scared

1264
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,463
Make it the ballot and I retract my position

1265
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
Yes

1266
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,559
First retraction of 2018

1267
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:41,727
How to start keeping track directed many from me over the years and I've only got a few

1268
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
You from you I think we forgot

1269
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,847
Keep the running tally it's cuz I'm more reasonable

1270
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,639
Your position

1271
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:55,039
I love the passion but it wasn't so much the guy that I am afraid of who might

1272
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:59,647
Accidentally press the button press the button I think it's probably tough for us

1273
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
Like

1274
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,255
You you stake a position and I'm like

1275
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
When I spend like

1276
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
Literally almost all of my time

1277
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
Reading

1278
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,143
Bees

1279
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,447
I hate to keep going back to the club but like

1280
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,239
These documents of like

1281
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,799
What you what you see when you restock

1282
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:17,823
AR

1283
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
Issues

1284
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,663
There's an issue there's a problem and then it

1285
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
100 pages of

1286
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,479
What could happen

1287
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:28,063
And Analyze That

1288
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,367
It's this gamesmanship in in rhetoric

1289
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,415
Text is like

1290
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
If this then what

1291
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
And it gets me in my brain space

1292
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:42,655
I don't know why I need to say this but I feel like I do which is that if I were in a position of

1293
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Actually making

1294
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
Decision with

1295
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
Real world

1296
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
I would be far more likely

1297
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
2

1298
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,871
Do what you do let's run for president

1299
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:58,271
You're just more willing to think about these things reasonably in a low-stakes environment

1300
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
Play situation with such loathsome like

1301
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:06,463
F*** it looks like random ass b******* you know I got a little wine

1302
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,999
I'll be chief of staff

1303
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
Probably be a much better front man and I would just let you make all the decisions

1304
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:21,055
Absolutely

1305
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,383
All right so you're one more clip of this rant

1306
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,455
And then we'll get to what happened throughout the rest of right after

1307
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,527
But this rain to take us out to a commercial break

1308
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
Mostly by demon

1309
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,511
Mitchell Wolfe

1310
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,607
Mr. wolf

1311
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,447
I guess

1312
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:55,103
Hyperbole or or are you with positioning are you with Devil's Advocate

1313
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:00,479
I don't really believe this

1314
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,207
They don't want you to know

1315
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,535
Literal

1316
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,583
On their bellies

1317
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:23,263
Nebraska

1318
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,735
Warren

1319
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,551
Exhaust brake

1320
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
Yes

1321
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:40,927
Where you at where you at on that ramp

1322
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Talking about

1323
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,743
For us

1324
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,815
Interesting conversation

1325
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
The ramifications of a lot of

1326
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
Penalty

1327
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:57,055
The rest of the world

1328
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,335
Tangents because

1329
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,615
To us this

1330
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,151
This is kind of run-of-the-mill

1331
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,199
Freaking out

1332
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
I can see why people would say

1333
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
See this as like a

1334
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
Define

1335
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,135
Anything to glom onto

1336
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,415
Mainly because

1337
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,695
Now I have

1338
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,047
If they are literal on their belly

1339
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Right

1340
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,375
Do they have

1341
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Who makes

1342
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,031
Cuz that's the guy we need

1343
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:35,967
All goes back to Amazon absolutely

1344
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:40,575
Find that to be the most reasonable thing that has been said so far tonight

1345
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,159
Amazon card as we are

1346
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,439
Literal

1347
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,743
Belly dwelling snakes

1348
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
Put a bunch of horseshit

1349
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,887
I always get kind of surprised by what capture

1350
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,655
People of the tent

1351
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
In terms of Alex

1352
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
Like

1353
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:02,847
I mean we go back to this over and over again but like last year on the March 30th episode where he told Adam Schiff

1354
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,407
Kick his ass and then the rest of the episode

1355
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
Sleep

1356
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:13,087
Drunk nonsense it's interesting to me that people glom onto that I'ma kick your ass your p****

1357
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
As opposed to

1358
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,415
Drunk for 3 hours

1359
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
I love

1360
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
Bright

1361
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
And Mexican with

1362
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,119
There are four ways

1363
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,935
I mean it's interesting to me

1364
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,495
I get on one level why people

1365
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,615
Like share this like crazy like isn't it funny that he calls Brian stelter

1366
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:43,295
Pretty pretty pretty pretty

1367
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,343
I also it's I mean it's important

1368
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
I think

1369
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,159
I genuinely believe that it's important

1370
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,487
Because that to point out these things about

1371
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
The anti-Semitic

1372
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,815
Rhetoric that he's spouting

1373
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,607
And how

1374
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:00,703
Complaints on this Brant that went viral we're about appearance

1375
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,495
Or they were triggered by a.

1376
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
Is not

1377
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,615
Necessarily something I'm seeing being covered

1378
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,895
And that kind of bothers me

1379
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:13,759
I think anybody with a grasp of Alex's history was important to him

1380
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,551
What you're saying

1381
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,367
Will you set a reminder about him criticizing everyone's appearance

1382
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,647
Totally valid

1383
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,695
But it's not you saying that they're ugly

1384
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,535
I want to clarify that in

1385
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
Specific

1386
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,119
Don't chew with your

1387
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,655
Analysis and I'm not try

1388
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,447
Defend him as a

1389
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
He's an equal-opportunity

1390
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,007
Opportunity kind of hater

1391
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,567
My point just being like

1392
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,359
That's fair

1393
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
I don't know

1394
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,967
I definitely think that there is absolutely some an

1395
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Tamara cleaning

1396
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,015
Behind behind

1397
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,599
Wouldn't jump that far this

1398
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:57,023
I mean I think as we as we look at stuff like this it is

1399
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,559
Defense because whenever I looked at the

1400
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,327
Their pictures

1401
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
They're both bald

1402
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
Yeah

1403
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,191
I don't know man

1404
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:17,247
Very very weird take onto the Iran protests

1405
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,831
This is a lot to do with liberals hating you but then he gets into that

1406
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
I think

1407
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
Immediately very self

1408
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,927
I really wish I had

1409
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,999
And said that

1410
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
God

1411
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
You're fine

1412
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,095
People like Hillary Clinton

1413
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,775
Journalist is wolfing henhouse

1414
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Michael Wolff

1415
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,991
Enjoy the climate of fake news media corporate media

1416
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:55,647
An open season on the truce open season on the president open season on loyal.

1417
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,423
Cultural and spiritual life

1418
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,519
Is culturally ruling us

1419
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,359
Leftist globalism allied with Islam

1420
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:20,735
Yeah about time we can watch combray sit down

1421
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,087
Is allied with radical Islam

1422
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,647
It is finished

1423
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,975
And the women standing up getting shot and killed

1424
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,583
Not good

1425
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
Progressive left

1426
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,407
Jeb

1427
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:53,503
Actual feminist in Iran remove it to fight oppression

1428
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:57,343
Some guys just get tortured and killed

1429
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,391
Photography

1430
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,207
Cushing

1431
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:07,071
Hood over Hatter Kutner General's office Liberal

1432
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:13,727
Because that's what liberals

1433
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:23,711
That sounds right that's poisoning the well narratives that sounds right that's all

1434
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,623
What are we doing that's just that's like the poisoning the food poisoning the water the vaccines

1435
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,463
Women come so boring

1436
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,999
But also this this is

1437
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,279
Massive

1438
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,327
Misunderstanding of people position

1439
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,399
If you want like the Liberals

1440
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,679
People on the last

1441
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
What are you talkin about is like

1442
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,495
Linda sarsour

1443
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
And those type of folks

1444
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,823
Their argument is

1445
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
If you want to wear it at

1446
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,919
A job you can I will slip into Alex's

1447
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
Dumb pronunciation

1448
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
It's not

1449
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,015
It's not anti

1450
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
Feminist

1451
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
To wear a hijab

1452
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
It's not

1453
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,855
It's anti-feminist

1454
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
To be forced

1455
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
To wear a hijab

1456
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,183
Or to be forced

1457
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,207
Not too

1458
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:12,607
Those two things are the there the polar sides of the problem

1459
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:17,471
Earliest you isn't with

1460
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
The force

1461
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:23,871
I grew up with a Muslim family in my neighborhood and I went to school

1462
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,663
The number of Muslim children

1463
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,479
And my dad is a religious studies professor and so

1464
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:31,295
Wheel well plugged into communities

1465
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
People growing up

1466
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
And largely

1467
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
With girls

1468
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
It was a choice

1469
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:46,655
Who's to know whether or not that's social pressure or not I'm not entirely sure but it's in no way my place

1470
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,447
To say you're making the wrong choice

1471
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:54,079
I choose who I have with Quebec

1472
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,103
In Publix

1473
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,151
That's crazy

1474
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
That's crazy

1475
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
It's crazy

1476
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,223
Right

1477
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,271
As awful as

1478
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,319
Majority Muslim

1479
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,391
Passing a if you don't wear a hijab

1480
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:12,511
Your

1481
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,559
Alex really wants to be

1482
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,143
All this stuff you really have to take issue with the Amish

1483
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
The Mennonites

1484
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,959
Write the all the anabaptists

1485
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,495
Well they're allowed

1486
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:29,663
The Jewish people wearing yamaka

1487
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:34,271
Like that I have to recuse myself

1488
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,671
There's a trickle down to it

1489
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,463
When my family was in a cult

1490
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,511
All of the women were forced

1491
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,535
To dress the same

1492
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:52,447
Like it is it is certainly a modest but it right time 8

1493
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,239
Troll

1494
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Whatever

1495
01:15:55,263 --> 01:16:00,383
Well if you want to invite you if you want to go into narrative that week

1496
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
You talked about

1497
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,199
With the one dumb lady

1498
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
From Alaska

1499
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,271
He's taking are you taking

1500
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,855
Women all the way colorful

1501
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,879
That is such a

1502
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Consistency

1503
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
Women can

1504
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Controlling

1505
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:17,791
We have to

1506
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Protect

1507
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:22,399
We remove any and all of their

1508
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,727
We're afraid of their sexuality and

1509
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,055
As much as we talk about how much of his stupid chick goes back to 8

1510
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,359
Is Medicare

1511
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,663
The book of the Bible

1512
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:39,551
No it just goes back to make a decision for yourself

1513
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,135
That's that whole fundamentalist tradition of abib

1514
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,183
You know like that sort of thing

1515
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,487
Automotive in fine if it wasn't for

1516
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,511
That's where this

1517
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
Controlling of women

1518
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,583
In religions historically

1519
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
Routes from

1520
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:58,495
Talking nonsense now go back to

1521
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
That type of roots

1522
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,543
Sober Legend

1523
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
It did not

1524
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,871
Become so male-dominated

1525
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Until it became

1526
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:12,575
The early church were like women were The Gatekeepers like

1527
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,623
About agriculture

1528
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:19,743
Women were the most spiritual leaders and then get into monotheism

1529
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:20,767
And

1530
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
Who would have guessed

1531
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,071
Men use it to control every

1532
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,655
It's almost as if like

1533
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,447
Religion isn't bad but

1534
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,983
Decentralization

1535
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
Controller

1536
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,823
As a political and social for smoothies

1537
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
About that rings

1538
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:42,271
What I was trying to get to know more about the Iran protest than I do but

1539
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,807
Anybody

1540
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,367
Twitter or

1541
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
Writing op-ed

1542
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,671
Being like

1543
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,951
These f****** women

1544
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
Their hijabs

1545
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:57,887
Are way out of line that perspective at all

1546
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,935
Score points office already established

1547
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,775
Linda sarsour wants you to put on a job for

1548
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,103
Event being like they don't support these people in a run

1549
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,407
Most people's perspective on

1550
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
Protest

1551
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
Pretty complicated

1552
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
Stuff

1553
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,271
It is it is

1554
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:20,927
I don't know it's one of those things that is very similar

1555
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
The protests in Iran

1556
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Voting for Roy Moore

1557
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,143
So as far

1558
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,703
So when you when you talk about

1559
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,775
Once again in Alabama

1560
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,055
Because of it

1561
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
Fundamentalist

1562
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,127
Directions to Ed religion

1563
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,919
You wind up having

1564
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,455
Percent of white women

1565
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,759
Voting for a guy who is

1566
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,551
Clearly against

1567
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,087
Anagen All rights for white

1568
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,695
Assertive statistical track for Evangelical

1569
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,999
And then you look at it

1570
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,303
Iran nuc the counter protest

1571
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
Does that were run

1572
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Bye

1573
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,143
Very pro-government sources

1574
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,727
Supported and put that together and you have that

1575
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Kind of

1576
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,055
Older women

1577
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
Situation where it's like

1578
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
You have to

1579
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,663
To do this because that is the

1580
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Tradition

1581
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,527
Even though they are the ones who have been most subjugate

1582
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,367
Anytime there's a protest

1583
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,415
Of the poor and the Young

1584
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,207
Everybody gets

1585
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,303
Like that's that's the situation that is going on in Iran right now

1586
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,839
It is the poor

1587
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,863
And it is the Young

1588
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:35,423
And they are fighting back and they are going to

1589
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
You get dis

1590
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:36,959
Droid

1591
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
Because they

1592
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
Simply aren't allowed

1593
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
Associate in the way that they should be

1594
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,663
Right now in so many universities in Iraq

1595
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
Tayron

1596
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,223
Many of the difference

1597
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
You find

1598
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
Pre-emptive arrest

1599
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,575
Going on right which are

1600
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,647
Roast turkey already

1601
01:19:55,903 --> 01:20:02,047
You you destroy or the cultural revolution in China

1602
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
Kind of ability for

1603
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:08,447
Educated useful people who are also the most unemployed

1604
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,727
Iran

1605
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,543
You are destroying any ability for them to gather at

1606
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
And then you can send

1607
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
Centralized power between

1608
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
People who use

1609
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,688
Tradition and just overwhelming

1610
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
Forced to

1611
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,760
And that's the situation

1612
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:27,648
It is

1613
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,952
Should be having that we are all incapable

1614
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,536
At the last I had less to do with the Liberals

1615
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:38,912
Two women having their boobs removed

1616
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:42,496
Or liberals being in favor of that or liberal

1617
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:46,080
I think that most liberal folk that I know deuce

1618
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Support

1619
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,640
In as much as they can

1620
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
Protest

1621
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,456
Better going on

1622
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,040
I don't think that there's any real legitimate way for us

1623
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,392
It's inexplicable that Nikki Haley would try and draw a

1624
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,672
Un conference

1625
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,488
To support protests that would

1626
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:07,328
Abject Lee destroy her life if they were to happen here

1627
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:13,728
Because I already know because we are supposed to

1628
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,800
It's profitable it's almost like the inverse

1629
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
Spring to Summer

1630
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
And it's really interesting

1631
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,968
Cialix be very Pro this time

1632
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,504
I'm very anti

1633
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,784
About others

1634
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,064
Where's similar thing

1635
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,648
Egypt and Saudi Arabia

1636
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,440
Allies

1637
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,744
Israel and Iran is our

1638
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
Call Adam

1639
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
And that's where you get into trouble

1640
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,608
Well that's worth

1641
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,400
Their people

1642
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
It is stupid

1643
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
Their people

1644
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
Who have

1645
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,496
Grievances

1646
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,288
Ultimate

1647
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,568
Failure of Nash

1648
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,128
Nationalism suggest

1649
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
That

1650
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,176
The leaders of a

1651
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
Are the

1652
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,784
When in reality most Americans

1653
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
Arnot

1654
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
Trump live

1655
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
And yet

1656
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:06,976
Buy Trump I know what Mario is I do know a lot

1657
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,280
Thirty-seven percent of population

1658
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,072
Yeah

1659
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:15,680
I think we're going to start to understand that Dynamic a lot more as time goes

1660
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,472
Nations are a failure

1661
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,008
Anyways

1662
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,056
Benson Veterinary

1663
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,336
Sing idea and I kind of agree

1664
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,616
But

1665
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
Be that as it may

1666
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
The best-case

1667
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,200
Scenario in the best like

1668
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,480
Look for the world is

1669
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:33,600
Collectivism quite frankly I am

1670
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,368
I think we are

1671
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,696
I think so I do not I don't poison the water

1672
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:43,072
It is

1673
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,424
We we specifically described

1674
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,728
People who support the show as

1675
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
Policy wonk

1676
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,544
Foreign policy wonk

1677
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,312
And global

1678
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:57,408
Like that is what is tongue-in-cheek

1679
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,248
Got a lot of ideas episode

1680
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,272
He's got a lot of

1681
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,344
Lotta bull s*** like I told you he had

1682
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
Abandoned but also was couch

1683
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
Before about

1684
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,488
This idea that this guy is a liar

1685
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,048
In this next clip we find on the

1686
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,840
This Friday he is

1687
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,288
Sit back and watch it is attempt to blow up Lighthouse political

1688
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,360
Lights fuse

1689
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,408
That's opposite distance

1690
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,448
Purple Coach bag

1691
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,752
Direct quote for

1692
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,336
Infowars Powers the Trump movement

1693
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360
That's a little fun

1694
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,640
Secondarily

1695
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,664
Alex

1696
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,200
Don't f****** pretend

1697
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
Shannon wasn't

1698
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:12,160
Don't f****** pretend he wasn't leaking to Rodger Stone

1699
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Through Rogers

1700
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,000
All of the narratives that Alex was pitching about how like

1701
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,304
Kushner is a globalist and all this stuff

1702
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,888
That's directly stuff it obviously had its Genesis with Banner

1703
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,448
Food in the White House of

1704
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
Course was was driving

1705
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
What's the driving

1706
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:34,176
The whole time that Alex was pitching this narrative that reince priebus was the globe

1707
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,480
Liquor was almost certainly

1708
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,272
Steve Bannon

1709
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,832
Like those two also had a bit of a feud

1710
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:46,464
Bought a few the palace entry not very well

1711
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,256
Coordinated

1712
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,072
He should not be playing is audience doesn't

1713
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,608
Take the time to think about

1714
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,192
Most of his narrative game for Bennett

1715
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
What's interesting

1716
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
I don't think

1717
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
Is audience

1718
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
Forgiveness

1719
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,128
Either I do

1720
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,688
I think so Brooklyn keep doing this

1721
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,224
I don't know

1722
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,368
I think that they're fooled into thinking that there is some credibility to it

1723
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,184
Cuz I think I think the way that Alex sells it

1724
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,720
The palace intrigue

1725
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,000
Isn't just dick

1726
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
It's being dicks

1727
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,304
Which is what it is

1728
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,656
I think that the way he sells it to his audience in the way.

1729
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,448
There is a team of globalist

1730
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,776
And then there's a team of trump people and they're doing War

1731
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
And so this Palace intrigue

1732
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Isn't just

1733
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,920
You know the I like the idea of your Elite

1734
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,968
Having a petty squabble

1735
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,016
It's actually one team

1736
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:46,112
Who is trying to save the world versus the bride

1737
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,392
So you've been able to wreak

1738
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,928
Contextualizing Rebrand

1739
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,744
Palace

1740
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,560
Which Eliquis probably most accurate

1741
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,840
Winners vs loser

1742
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,912
They're all losers but

1743
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
I think in his

1744
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,264
In his the way that you make an Alex Jones audience

1745
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Interested in this

1746
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,312
Palace Inn

1747
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,128
Is these are the good guys

1748
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
Who are winning

1749
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,712
Just like we are all bright

1750
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
If there's a counter counter rabbit

1751
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
I think it's I think it's

1752
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:18,624
Less winners and losers and more of misappropriation

1753
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,416
But isn't that

1754
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,464
Isn't that ultimately his

1755
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
His ID

1756
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048
What his audience

1757
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:26,816
Interested in

1758
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,352
They want to see

1759
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,120
People win

1760
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:32,704
They want to see the winners

1761
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,008
Possibly

1762
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,056
I think at the same time he's already

1763
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:37,824
You spend so much time

1764
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Time catching like

1765
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,504
I got sort of thing so I don't know

1766
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,832
We're winning we're the winners were winning all the time

1767
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,880
They're still coming after us

1768
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:55,744
And we're losing on all fronts but where the winners were always winning

1769
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,584
But we're on the edge of losing it all time

1770
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
That the fight

1771
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,168
Is really more important

1772
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:05,216
The Narrative that the winning or losing

1773
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:09,568
The presentation of winning and losing he can sell either to move product

1774
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,872
Ants keep people engaged

1775
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
But without

1776
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,200
Squabble without fight there is no

1777
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Way he can keep

1778
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
His Machine movie

1779
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:22,112
On a political scale tomorrow

1780
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,184
You could come out and you could do a shower he's like we are f******

1781
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
Losing

1782
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
And he could use that

1783
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,536
Right he could use that to his advantage

1784
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,560
She couldn't use

1785
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,352
All is well everybody is

1786
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,144
Everything is operating

1787
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:37,728
Like Trump is doing all the right things and people seem to be enjoying it

1788
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,520
That's true there's no way

1789
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,056
He needs

1790
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,104
False the boogeyman the

1791
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,920
Antagonist that is Imagine

1792
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,456
In order to fuel his rhetoric

1793
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,528
Which then we go back to his art his comment

1794
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
About

1795
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
The media needs

1796
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,600
Trump right

1797
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,880
Like there isn't a

1798
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,952
I do think there's an arguable position to support him

1799
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,976
In that an ALICE

1800
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,256
We'll only about himself

1801
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:05,120
If married immediately fair enough

1802
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,680
Cuz I don't think that the media needs somebody to

1803
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:11,008
I mean I remember when I was younger watching

1804
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,544
MacNeil Lehrer hour

1805
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,848
It was boring as hell but it's

1806
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:20,224
And it was the news that's where your position goes back to the very beginning which is

1807
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,504
Venusian carob

1808
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,528
About ratings right

1809
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,552
Just like

1810
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,088
Alex needs to move product

1811
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,624
So does the news need to

1812
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,160
Advertising

1813
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:34,816
Bigger conversation problem

1814
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,864
I mean let's not but

1815
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
Position

1816
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,680
Clearly

1817
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
No point in them

1818
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,312
F***-you River Madara

1819
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,336
Murdock

1820
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,128
Anyway

1821
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:55,040
Green with the Russia investigation

1822
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,840
Sociopaths and Psychopaths

1823
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,112
Is that

1824
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,184
That's not the case with Wolfie

1825
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,720
Skelter

1826
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:42,656
Everybody around them

1827
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,800
Andrew Jocelyn elders

1828
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
Projectionists

1829
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,920
Totally there the case they're like he's

1830
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,944
Projecting his life

1831
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,760
Psychology into another person even to the point of like

1832
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,064
I don't want to I don't want to

1833
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,624
Bring up the Goldwater rule

1834
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,160
Come down on Alex

1835
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:04,928
Because I can

1836
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:08,256
He probably has an abuse and is it like I don't feel like that

1837
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:12,608
Good to tell Mama craving like that but even by his own words

1838
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,632
The idea that

1839
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,936
Whether or not she actually did

1840
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:20,544
He felt like his mom said he couldn't get love after the age of 5 or 6

1841
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Like that

1842
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:24,640
Although we may have information that says

1843
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,200
No probably not

1844
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,248
That doesn't change that that's how he felt

1845
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,320
That doesn't change that emotionally real to him

1846
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,856
Right

1847
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
You're right about the

1848
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
The fact that

1849
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:40,000
35 years later he's on the radio crying talking about that

1850
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:44,352
Realtor in some form or another

1851
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:47,168
Mtume that indicates

1852
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,960
He did not have a great child

1853
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,728
Something

1854
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,752
Wrong

1855
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
I'm not begging

1856
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,080
Fun of him for that but I am

1857
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,104
Saying that

1858
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,640
Look at what he

1859
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
He's saying about

1860
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,456
Steve Bannon

1861
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:02,528
You know maybe this is one of these guys who was abused and

1862
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:07,648
After that describing him

1863
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
Troubling

1864
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,976
Immediately

1865
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
Describing comes

1866
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
Yeah

1867
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:18,912
Sick want to take down everyone around them to feel like the big man you created

1868
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,704
Worldview to fight again

1869
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,752
Well not just that but look at the

1870
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,776
The people that he has

1871
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
Surrounded

1872
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:32,736
All of the iPhones

1873
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,808
Clearly

1874
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,832
He can bully

1875
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:37,856
He can

1876
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,160
Superior then

1877
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,440
Imagine

1878
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,512

Somebody is competition

1881
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,960
Maybe impossible man there's no one is

1882
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,752
Alright

1883
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:58,336
No I mean I don't mean

1884
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,360
Because competent

1885
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
To Stronger

1886
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
Bright

1887
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,944
I don't know I

1888
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,992
Me out because like

1889
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,296
The perspective that we have on him

1890
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,624
The way he presented

1891
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,648
Himself her so like

1892
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,440
He's sowing

1893
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Consistent with him

1894
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:14,976
I'm self

1895
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
It's just making me

1896
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,072
It's an inch

1897
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:28,288
You often wind up being capable of empathy

1898
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
With

1899
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,896

1900
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920

1901
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,248
Sympathy for the Devil

1902

The childhood of a Serial Killer and Ben Li

1904
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,952
Man that must

1905
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,512
You have empathy

1906
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
Before them

1907
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,328
At the same time they need to be taken

1908
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,608
You know

1909
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,912
Deer Behavior

1910
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,680
Feed the m

1911
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,960
Empathy we have for you based on

1912
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
Your circumstances

1913
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,264
Alex

1914
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,200
Not a person

1915
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:10,784
Flip ourselves

1916
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
Victoria Milan

1917
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:18,208
Alex Jones makes it about the globalist

1918
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:25,376
And so they want to ruin and wrecked civilization and they are committed to doing it and they are

1919
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,728
Hurting you and your family poisoning or food water

1920
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:39,712
None of them

1921
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
Aspartame

1922
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,296
If the president

1923
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:46,880
Your mother

1924
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,464

1925
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,104
So hold on hold on they still go to malls

1926
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,872
Sometimes

1927
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:12,224
Hillary will just go around to a shopping mall and just be like well at least I'm hurting

1928
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,248
I didn't

1929
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,040
I didn't win the presidency

1930
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:23,488
Interior shopping mall November 9th Bill and Hillary

1931
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:27,840
Reenter walk past a wetzel's pretzels

1932
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,864
Very depressed

1933
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,936
Very sad many people coming up to them giving them

1934
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,960
Accolades

1935
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,288
Wishing them well and their next artist bill

1936
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Bill

1937
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,640
Dialogue

1938
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:45,248
Pretzel with cheese

1939
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,784
Hillary dialogue

1940
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,832
I don't

1941
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,904
I don't feel worthy of a pretzel right now I

1942
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,696
I lost an election to Donald Trump

1943
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
Bill

1944
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,000
Now hold on

1945
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
Look around you

1946
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:00,864
Look to the left look to the right

1947
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:04,192
You just talk to people that you hurt

1948
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,104
Keep your chin up, you're hurting these people that's what matters I lost the impressions

1949
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,872

1950
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:14,944
Rough when you are writing script

1951
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,504
You are gold my friend you are golf

1952
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,392
Stocking ideas just is crazy

1953
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,928
Take solace in the fact that I'm hurting

1954
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,976
Alright well keep chin up

1955
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:34,144
Statistically that's not the case about people on the last taking vaccines

1956
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:39,520
The largest percentage of people who don't take back right there that is

1957
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,312
Do you find that Within

1958
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,848
People who have

1959
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,896
Especially tea party beliefs

1960
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:50,528
Yep they're the more you know about vaccines

1961
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,320
Less likely you are to not

1962
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:57,184
Honest and I find a lot of

1963
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,768
People on the left also the people

1964
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,560
Are very

1965
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,352
Trains

1966
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,144
GMOs like that

1967
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:13,568
A different different conversation

1968
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Is the same as Max

1969
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
Camsoda

1970
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,408
Diet Coke

1971
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,456
Same thing we do what is the same through all of them

1972
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
Pearl poison

1973
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,040
Call boring

1974
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:23,808
Matthew semitism

1975
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,368
Prepackaged really thought you were almost

1976
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,416
F*** Larry nickel

1977
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,232
No no

1978
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Yes

1979
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,560
This point Alex

1980
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,352
Commercial

1981
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,936
He's back on the stelter

1982
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:44,800
S*** a little bit

1983
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,848
He makes this

1984
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,128
This claim that

1985
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,664
Raising

1986
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,272
This is supported by anything I just I love it

1987
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,320
This guy is a known

1988
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
Charlatan

1989
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,208
Simply insane

1990
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:02,976
Just like

1991
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,768
His son Brian stelter

1992
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:15,776
Photos of Hillary smiling

1993
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,312
Surface

1994
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
So

1995
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,128
So if I understand correctly

1996
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
Both wolf

1997
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,688
Ansell

1998
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,224
Are attempting

1999
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,624
Individually they are related to each other

2000
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,416
No I think my point is

2001
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,280
Why are they trying to keep pictures of themselves room

2002
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,560
You're missing pronoun

2003
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:42,912
Okay it is about the two of them pictures of them being trying to

2004
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,448
Kept off the internet

2005
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,728
They were doing it

2006
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:52,384
It's the globalist that are trying to keep us both

2007
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,432
Constantly on Google like

2008
01:37:54,688 --> 01:38:00,832
Guitarist complete horseshit

2009
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,880
I love that idea

2010
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:07,488
He can say stuff and it just be like a toss aside or whatever but even in that case he's like

2011
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:08,768
Furious

2012
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,072
Seriously

2013
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,120
I know that they're trying

2014
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,680
Need to keep pictures of them smiling off the internet

2015
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,984
Cuz it shows how evil they are

2016
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,264
A lot more work

2017
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:21,824
Why

2018
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,640
Would you try and keep

2019
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,920
Keep pictures of yourself off the

2020
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:29,760
You would nausea

2021
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,552
Themselves with pictures

2022
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,368
I just tried to get a picture

2023
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:39,232
There's a picture of him that he took for a magazine or he's like

2024
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:43,328
Screaming at the camera

2025
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
Seats and everything but

2026
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:46,144
It seems so unimportant

2027
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,728
Come to me when I was listening to episodes from like 2014

2028
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,520
Capture clip of it but he's just like

2029
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,312
Now I wish I would

2030
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:57,408
Get rid of that picture

2031
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,200
Okay that's pretty

2032
01:38:59,456 --> 01:38:59,968
With

2033
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
Yeah that's that's crazy

2034
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,624
Very strange but I think it's just because he asked

2035
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
The flex zone

2036
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,184
We can't substitute talk about

2037
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:14,048
Like I said we might last

2038
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,840
Great name for our new show

2039
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
The wolf issue

2040
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:24,288
Only shot on Banning and that last couple Clips back or whatever

2041
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,312
Able to talk about like

2042
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
Why

2043
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,896
He's not ready to get into like them

2044
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,968
Had we been betrayed by one of the

2045
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,760
Biggest influences

2046
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,552
Of the last

2047
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,856
Campaign manager and

2048
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:38,880
What

2049
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:42,720
Whisperer for the first year or for the first

2050
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,256
Mom cell

2051
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,560
Officer

2052
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,912
Campaign manager

2053
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,936
There was

2054
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,704
Manafort

2055
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,472
Indicted

2056
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,520
Go to jail Rodger Stone

2057
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,544
Alex Jones body

2058
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,568
Probably

2059
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,848
Eminem

2060
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
Siri

2061
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:04,736
Who's Lewandowski a manager of campaign or was he just like

2062
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:05,504
Okay

2063
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:09,088
I thought you might have risen to that height

2064
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:13,184
He also apparently sexually assaulted

2065
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,536
Makeamericagreatagain dressed

2066
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,816
To the the Grammys

2067
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:23,424
Made a big scene out of it and then she was a frequent guest on Alex Jones Show talking about

2068
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,240
How bringing Trump into the musical world is going to be

2069
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:32,640
Huge and Lewandowski sexually assaulted like it up loud

2070
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,200
I can't remember what it was but she was at

2071
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,248
Some big truck party at Lewandowski

2072
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
He slapped her ass

2073
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,648
In-N-Out he slapped her ass again

2074
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,512
But also for her

2075
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,584
I mean that's not good for her that you sex

2076
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
I mean cuz f*** it

2077
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,448
As we

2078
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,472
Just saw a recent

2079
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,520
One of the Roy Moore

2080
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,288
Accusers

2081
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
Her house

2082
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,080
Has burned down

2083
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,616
And it is

2084
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
Too early to

2085
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,920
Speculate and say that it was

2086
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,456
Buy a Roy Morris

2087
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,224
Supporter

2088
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
But

2089
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:15,136
Otherwise it

2090
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,160
Politico

2091
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:22,560
Who headlined for Anna makeamericagreatagain dress at the Grammys early this year was celebrating the president's first year in office

2092
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,840
Holiday party at the Trump

2093
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,376
International Hotel in Washington

2094
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:28,192
In late November when Lewandowski slapped her behind

2095
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,728
After she objected

2096
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,008
He dismissed her concerns

2097
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
It's laughter behind again

2098
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,080
Via said in an interview Friday

2099
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:38,688
Vf-31 said she was circulating in the ballroom of the invite only party with a friend

2100
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,992
Who brought her over to introduce her to Lewandowski

2101
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,528
Whom she had never met

2102
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
Her first impression

2103
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,832
She said was that he

2104
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
He seemed dismissive

2105
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:49,952
And he rolled his eyes when he thought she wanted to pose for a photo with him

2106
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:55,840
I said if you're busy don't worry about it we don't have to take a photo via recalling do and telling Lewandowski

2107
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:59,424
Who remains contentious Oval Office

2108
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,704
Political strategy

2109
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,472
The earlier this week

2110
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,776
Deicide another reveler pushed her

2111
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:06,080
Toward him and she ended up standing next

2112
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,360
Posing for a photo

2113
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,896
Despite his seeming lack of

2114
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,688
I'm wearing a silver suit

2115
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,456
Stretchy pants

2116
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:14,016
And after the photo we smacked my ass really hard.

2117
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,808
Is completely demeaning

2118
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
Shocking

2119
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
In the moment via said she

2120
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,392
I confronted him I said watch it

2121
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,416
Half-joking

2122
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,720
I said I can report you for sexual harassment

2123
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:26,304
Lewandowski's response you said was almost as shocking as the original

2124
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:29,120
He said go ahead I work in the private sector

2125
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:29,888
Revia recalled

2126
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,680
Smacks my ass again

2127
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,216
Vias Recollections against

2128
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,008
Was corroborated by a friend who Whitney

2129
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,800
Exchange the friends that he wished

2130
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
To remain anonymous

2131
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,336
The part of Louis

2132
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,384
In part because of Lewandowski continued

2133
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,152
Influence of Trumps

2134
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:46,784
So I'll talk about that I have her on when she's a propaganda tool

2135
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,832
I wearing a Maga dress

2136
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,136
But he's not willing to treat her like a human

2137
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:59,840
And also this one

2138
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:00,864
And you will be

2139
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,656
Whatever it is

2140
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:05,216
Calls into like

2141
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,752
Memory of lewandowski's

2142
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,056
The salt on that reporter lady

2143
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,848
Yep back

2144
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,616
The campaign

2145
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:14,432
Remember the timeline of that exactly but

2146
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,248
You watch the videos that he absolutely grabs her and

2147
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
Pretty bad

2148
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,320
It's hard to imagine

2149
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,088
Can anybody in the

2150
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,880
Circle

2151
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,904
Not being

2152
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
Stop

2153
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,536
In many ways like even

2154
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,304
Look

2155
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,632
I get

2156
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
Probably

2157
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,960
He hasn't sexually harassed

2158
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,240
Outside of

2159
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:39,776
Marriage

2160
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:45,152
Unless you use Alex Jones about Jim Comey

2161
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:45,920
Oh that's good

2162
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:52,064
You know these guys who are up to they're the ones you got to work

2163
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,368
Karen UPS American Psycho

2164
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,392
Mike Pence

2165
01:43:55,648 --> 01:44:01,024
Does seem to have all the all of the like Dennis hastert

2166
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,560
You know I'm saying

2167
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:09,216
Like you've got all of those characteristics

2168
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,520
Anything I'm just saying that the parallels but

2169
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,104
His positions have

2170
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,384
Been played for

2171
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Barry Hester

2172
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:21,760
I feel like he's more like that Foley

2173
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:28,672
Thrown off the Hell in a Cell

2174
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:32,000
Congressman

2175
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,304
At the surf

2176
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:40,704
For sex with a public bathroom has first name

2177
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,008
It's more like that that's the vibe I get more from him

2178
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,544
Not abusing people I like

2179
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,384
The repressed with a secret

2180
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,712
Some sort of secret

2181
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,480
Something there

2182
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,248
Yeah

2183
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,576
Not fully human and

2184
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,112
Experian full-on

2185
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,392
Bull on conspiracy

2186
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,976
I'm going to go I'm going to go out on a full-on limo

2187
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,536
Stone is working

2188
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:09,632
I mean I don't think that's that crazy to think at this point

2189
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,240
Alex

2190
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,008
Straight up

2191
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,032
Trump

2192
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:21,664
Lakestone seems like the guy who if I was the FBI I would lean on Stoneham

2193
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,432
Sooner be like

2194
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,736
Oh s*** yeah I'm going to talk to everybody over I'm

2195
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,272
I don't give a fuk

2196
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,320
You've had a life of

2197
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
But self-preservation

2198
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:33,696
Yes to

2199
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,464
To navigate

2200
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
Being

2201
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,280
Intimately involved

2202
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,048
With

2203
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,608
The Amber of scandalous

2204
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:43,680
Keep president disgraced

2205
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,216
President

2206
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,752
A lot of campaign

2207
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,336
Did not work out and he's still able to survive

2208
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,616
And have some sort of

2209
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,384
Stock

2210
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,920
I don't

2211
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,968
Thank you do that necessarily by playing

2212
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,016
Rat

2213
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:58,784
Stone is Marshall

2214
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,576
In that

2215
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:01,856
Stone is much like Beyonce

2216
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
In that

2217
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,416
The Survivor

2218
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,184
And he

2219
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,720
He has a tattoo of Richard

2220
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,000
Sure

2221
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,536
Beyonce got that makes

2222
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
Sometime

2223
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,632
I don't obviously I don't think

2224
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,264
That I'm I'm I'm going to co-sign your conspiracy theory but if it does come out that he snatched

2225
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:22,080
Like that wouldn't right right

2226
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,384
It wouldn't surprise me. Especially because of like

2227
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,480
He's the only person who in the Infowars mayou

2228
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,528
Like in terms of

2229
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,088
Naked with his band and stuff with this wolf

2230
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:35,904
He's the only person who's been on the show he's been like

2231
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,792
Like you could almost see him being on video game like

2232
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
Please stop

2233
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,864
Yeah please don't do this

2234
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,912
This is unraveling

2235
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:51,264
This is how you unravel is by giving credibility to

2236
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544
This kind of a story

2237
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,336
You don't have to

2238
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,152
He knows because he has

2239
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:00,480
Decades.

2240
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:06,880
Is there a smarter than everyone else I need to say

2241
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:07,648
Stone is this

2242
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
Smartest person

2243
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,464
That is been around Trump so far

2244
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,256
He's the smartest person who's on info

2245
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:19,168
That's not high Bart across the only problem though to Duchess like

2246
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,704
A hair trigger

2247
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:26,080
I'm angry about it which is not what a smart person would have

2248
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,616
But at the same time like

2249
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,152
Freaking out calling women

2250
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:32,736
On Twitter and stuff like that doesn't have the political Rams

2251
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,760
Applications

2252
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,296
Believing

2253
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,856
A creative nonfiction writer

2254
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,136
Inexplicably

2255
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,672
It doesn't have the same Cottage

2256
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,232
Bullock historically and I think about the

2257
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,024
Historically

2258
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,816
Over the last year or so

2259
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,376
Pretty clear that Bannon

2260
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,912
Rodger Stone

2261
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,192
Aren't working in

2262
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,032
Number of times where Rodger Stone has a

2263
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,056
Attacked

2264
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,616
Van in for various things

2265
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,664
And the two of them don't see eye-to-eye on

2266
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:06,784
Immediately after the story came out when Rodger was being interviewed on Infowars

2267
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,320
His take on it was

2268
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,600
I know

2269
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
Michael Wolff

2270
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,648
This is nonsense

2271
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,440
And then beyond that like

2272
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,208
Look

2273
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,280
Abandoned goes around where to

2274
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,304
How many button up shirts

2275
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,584
At the same time

2276
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,168
We are coworkers

2277
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,192
Bruno

2278
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,984
I'm going to attack

2279
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,264
The enemies

2280
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,056
I'm not going to attack our allies

2281
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,848
And that is

2282
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Text Helen

2283
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,664
Cuz he knows

2284
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,688
This could on

2285
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,456
Uncover some

2286
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:38,784
The only way it's going to uncover anything

2287
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,832
Is it

2288
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:45,952
Exactly the people in The Alex Jones propaganda world the people in Trump's

2289
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:49,024
Inner Circle of yourself

2290
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,816
Kind of mentality world

2291
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:54,912
Yes the only way things are going to get bad as if they all start freaking out

2292
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:55,680
He's trying to

2293
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,704
Keep it together

2294
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,728
And Alex Camp

2295
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,288
I don't think you can get it I think that he's going to

2296
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,312
He's going to lose it

2297
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,616
I don't think stone is a mastermind

2298
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:08,480
This isn't Mastermind strategy

2299
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:10,272
I think

2300
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,064
How do you hit

2301
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,368
And when to

2302
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,928
Edwin like

2303
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,696
He knows how to turn

2304
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,000
Yeah that is very basic

2305
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,280
Stop very basic

2306
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,840
Anyway

2307
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,448
Weird

2308
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:31,008
Compares Donald Trump to a historical

2309
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
Very interesting

2310
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,408
Deliberate

2311
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:42,016
Someone that delivers

2312
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:52,768
But just like the British history books did William Wallace

2313
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:55,840
He wasn't a coward he was an honorable man

2314
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:56,608
Because

2315
01:49:56,864 --> 01:50:01,984
Everybody intrinsic knows everything the Isle of garbage

2316
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,544
You are the Y

2317
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,896
Before I do I'd like

2318
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,432
To say that

2319
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:12,480
Nothing

2320
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:16,064
Historically is known about William Wallace except for around

2321
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,344
1297

2322
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,368
1298

2323
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,928
That's pretty much the only. That's known

2324
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,696
About him

2325
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:26,048
Everything else comes from an epic poem called The X and deeds of

2326
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,328
Sir William Wallace Knight

2327
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,376
Erda cierrale.

2328
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:32,960
Written around 1470 by blind

2329
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:37,312
He rewrote from oral Traditions Library the minstrel amazing Ensure

2330
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,592
Information about him

2331
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,384
Could see perfectly

2332
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,152
Could not play

2333
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,176
Interesting

2334
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:48,832
Interesting really is like a fake news name

2335
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:55,488
Anyway he came up with this this acting Deeds of Sir William Al's 170 years after William Wallace

2336
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,560
Historians think that is

2337
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:00,352
Very unsort 80

2338
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,376
Take

2339
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,656
On my way

2340
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:05,472
Quotes

2341
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,568
Leyden most of the problem is

2342
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,104
.

2343
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:12,896
If using traditional

2344
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:13,664
Chivalric

2345
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,712
Motifs or borrowed from

2346
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,736
Exploits of others

2347
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,272
And attributed to William Wallace

2348
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:23,648
The only things that we know about William Wallace or a couple of battles

2349
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,928
British noble

2350
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:31,328
Is a Scottish dude was a f****** he was angry there was unrest

2351
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:35,680
At the time and there were the British were imposing a bunch of

2352
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:38,496
Taxes that you didn't like on Scotland

2353
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,032
And so he assassinated

2354
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:40,800
The dude

2355
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:44,896
In the telling of blind Harry

2356
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
And then the movie

2357
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,968
With the Great

2358
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,528
Great not anti-semitic milk

2359
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,552
Hold on

2360
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,088
Rain

2361
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,160
Okay and I move it.

2362
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,952
The story is told as the

2363
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,256
This guy was trying to

2364
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,280
The kill his wife

2365
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,072
Pennysaver his wife

2366
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:07,424
It was in response to that rap battle

2367
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,448
It is probably

2368
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,472
Just about taxation

2369
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:12,288
Which actually triggers Alex even more than a wife

2370
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,080
Sister-in-law

2371
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,640
The other thing is the Battle of Falkirk

2372
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:19,968
We're only thing that William Wallace is

2373
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,504
Actually known to have

2374
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:28,416
He lost the battle battle of Falkirk

2375
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:30,976
He was very overly confident

2376
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:32,000
The British flag

2377
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,560
And

2378
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,608
Granted he escaped and I was

2379
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:38,400
Billy murdered

2380
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:42,240
Fusion that they gave him

2381
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:44,800
There is a storical record

2382
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
That's nuts

2383
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:52,480
Nbad was drawn and quartered if that's not even

2384
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:55,296
Expensive but they caught him but not kill him

2385
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,344
They found him and then cut him down

2386
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,136
When he was about to go unconscious

2387
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,160
Amanda

2388
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,184
Fouled him

2389
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,232
Right

2390
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:05,536
Yeah but that

2391
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,072
No it

2392
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:07,840
Except

2393
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:14,240
Beat the levels to like they kept almost killing him again

2394
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:16,544
Torture

2395
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,336
To know how good people used to

2396
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,152
They were great they were really good at that

2397
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:23,200
Not good at doctors

2398
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:23,968
Diseases

2399
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,040
Goddamn

2400
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,600
You could assume that they could have f***** it up

2401
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:36,000
And accidentally kills him early in the tortured they were trying to do and they got lucky and he didn't die

2402
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:42,400
Torturing

2403
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:45,216
Doing it like they would often

2404
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:47,520
I'll up and put them on trial again

2405
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:49,568
It's my understanding

2406
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:50,592
Afterwards

2407
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,896
Like you was being disemboweled

2408
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,432
But be that as it may

2409
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,480
That's sort of

2410
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,832
Time machine now we need

2411
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:03,648
To disembowel a guy and see if he can survive that

2412
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,440
This

2413
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:08,256
Like to meet

2414
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,536
This is the important

2415
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:13,632
That's capital

2416
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
With excessive

2417
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:15,936
Even for the time

2418
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,008
To someone

2419
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:21,824
Memes that this was not just a normal person

2420
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,872
Failed in a battle or something like that

2421
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,920
It was someone who was the British

2422
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,480
For some reason

2423
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:32,576
But unfortunately the historical records that we have don't

2424
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,880
Tell exactly what that was

2425
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,928
And there's no real reason to think

2426
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,976
Play Super honorable person

2427
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:42,048
Most of the accounts that come from that timer

2428
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,072
Yeah like use a

2429
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,608
Roodle f****** dude

2430
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,376
Like he would

2431
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:49,472
If you would behavin way like the British that killed him

2432
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,496
I thought my tax

2433
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,776
Explain why they did that.

2434
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,824
I'm not entirely sure but

2435
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,920
History is boring out that he was an honorable person

2436
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:01,504
To know that

2437
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,296
Movie

2438
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:07,904
Right it's a movie or if you want to give Alex a little more credibility

2439
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,696
Which oral tradition

2440
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:14,816
From this guy who is the Jonathan

2441
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,864
It's that it's nice parallel

2442
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:22,496
Is the fake news

2443
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,288
So

2444
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,336
And Alex Jones

2445
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:28,128
LOL

2446
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,920
Alex I got news for you baby

2447
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,456
We don't need history

2448
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,736
To determine how bad

2449
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,576
That's happening concurrently and everyone has

2450
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:41,184
For a while I was just trying to make a metaphor in Spanish

2451
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,256
Trash

2452
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:47,584
Express

2453
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:07,040
The highway but you don't want to run up to it

2454
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:30,848
So that's what metaphor Falls is bad from the job but the metaphor is

2455
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:34,688
The globalists are a dead carcass by the side of the road and it grows

2456
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,968
You grabbing

2457
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
Them

2458
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,040
Bringing back into bed with you

2459
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,064
I guess

2460
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,088
So his advice

2461
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:44,672
I guess is that you don't take a seat

2462
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:46,208
Global fine

2463
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:52,096
I know that's metaphorical but I guess what you saying is don't

2464
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:53,888
Globalist

2465
01:56:58,752 --> 01:56:59,264
Globalist

2466
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:01,824
It's it's

2467
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,616
It Resort

2468
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,896
Metaphors that leave

2469
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:09,504
Way more questions than answers

2470
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,320
You see that animal on the side of the road leave it alone

2471
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,368
Great dad animal

2472
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,136
Fat

2473
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:17,696
I can with you on that metaphor

2474
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:19,232
Yes there's a state department

2475
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,000
It's paid for it

2476
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:24,352
Through taxes and regulations

2477
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,144
Well not if Trump has

2478
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:29,728
I was going to have to take that

2479
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:34,592
But the big issue to me comes

2480
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:36,128
To like where is the bridge

2481
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:40,736
Like with a metaphor metaphor is only as good as the connection to reality

2482
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,528
Sure

2483
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,808
Like where is it

2484
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,600
Where is the connection to like

2485
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,624
The point that he's trying to me

2486
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,952
Appointees trying to make is that like globalist

2487
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,256
Plate starts with him saying that

2488
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,536
These globalist

2489
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,328
You shouldn't hate them you should pity

2490
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,400
Animal dead by the side of the road

2491
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,704
I suppose

2492
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,264
To the Animal by the side of the road is dangerous

2493
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,800
In some way because it wants to

2494
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,824
To take over your life

2495
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,104
So the animals back

2496
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,152
No

2497
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,968
Globalist I don't know

2498
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,552
I don't get it

2499
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:16,832
It's trouble

2500
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:17,600
Anyway

2501
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:18,368
Troubling

2502
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:22,208
We can leave that aside we have one more clip Jordan

2503
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:23,488
Alex

2504
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:24,768
Decides to get into hot

2505
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:28,096
The pop Hot Topic

2506
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:31,680
Like Hillary goes to

2507
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
To say that she

2508
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,752
No this is bad

2509
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:35,776
Celebrity

2510
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:39,360
What's the suicide guy

2511
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,128
Logan

2512
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,664
What are we doing this

2513
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,992
Because my prediction was that Alex

2514
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:50,368
Only defending Logan Paul

2515
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,160
He's a male

2516
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:56,768
I thought.

2517
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:57,792
Also

2518
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,584
Strictly speaking

2519
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:02,144
I support Logan Paul

2520
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,912
Making that

2521
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,704
Interesting take

2522
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,496
But just based on

2523
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,264
Free speech

2524
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:10,592
Okay I think you should suffer all the consequences

2525
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:14,176
Cuz of doing it

2526
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:17,248
It's incredibly disgraceful it's

2527
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,272
It indicates

2528
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:20,320
A lack of Humanity on your part

2529
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,880
But the idea of saying don't do it

2530
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:23,904
Or like

2531
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:28,000
We should stop you from making this video or

2532
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,280
Right

2533
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,120
Let me night falls right in line with Alex Jones

2534
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:33,888
Principles

2535
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,680
Of Defending free speech

2536
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,960
And I thought for sure

2537
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,752
This is not someone he would

2538
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,032
Pink is

2539
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:45,920
Evil I thought for sure Alex would be like

2540
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:48,992
Everyone's trying to come down on Logan Paul we got a dependent

2541
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,784
He's a very different take

2542
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,576
I'm interested to hear what it's

2543
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:53,856
Squall

2544
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:55,904
Is it standard

2545
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,184
No it's

2546
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:00,000
Chaos and then at the end

2547
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,024
He gets to

2548
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:08,960
Kisses on the side of the road

2549
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:11,264
He betrays his own positions

2550
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,288
For a bit

2551
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,568
Out of pettiness

2552
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,640
About to play

2553
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,408
He slammed

2554
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,432
He slam dunk

2555
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:21,248
No to something really suck

2556
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:28,672
Sastre upload suicide forest

2557
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,008
Masculine

2558
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,664
What then

2559
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,480
We show

2560
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,296
Army troops

2561
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,832
Children

2562
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:03,744
No idea

2563
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,280
YouTube

2564
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,144
I don't know either I don't know this

2565
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,192
Specifics of this but if I had to guess

2566
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,472
I would say that I would say

2567
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,520
This video also had other piece

2568
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:19,104
I would assume it wasn't just straight video of army

2569
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,408
Saving kids I would say that there's probably

2570
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,992
Something that broke terms of service

2571
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,576
For YouTube to take some

2572
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:29,856
It takes

2573
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:34,208
Or using a song that

2574
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:38,048
If you don't have an audience

2575
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,096
I have enough people watching

2576
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:42,144
Then they'll start. Shut that down

2577
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:48,800
Copyright claim

2578
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,568
Decent

2579
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:52,384
It's someone who was in that video that Alex

2580
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,152
Shot

2581
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:58,528
Or something like that

2582
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
Infowars

2583
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,344
I don't know if that's the case but that's

2584
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,880
A possible explanation for it

2585
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:06,720
So like you see why he's kind of pissed off about it

2586
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:07,488
Is that

2587
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,304
We have videos taken down down where the f***

2588
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,840
Which is not

2589
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:12,864
Free Speech position

2590
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,888
Can it's not principle

2591
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,520
Culture of little league Twisted people

2592
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:28,736
I mean ours is

2593
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:31,808
Shut up

2594
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:33,600
You can say what they are

2595
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:37,696
Japan turned out for weeks

2596
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:44,864
We're a Romeo Juliet story

2597
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:47,936
Themselves

2598
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:51,264
A big joke

2599
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:57,664
Makes fun of a dead body

2600
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,712
Show twisted

2601
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,552
Give three more

2602
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:13,024
Get off on somebody's misery and they're rotting dead body

2603
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,304
Makes fun of it

2604
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:16,352
And then make money off of it

2605
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,960
And do it while you're wearing a hat

2606
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,896
Okay

2607
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,248
Brickyard

2608
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:36,064
This is what it's all about

2609
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:38,880
That's what it's all about

2610
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:42,464
Yoda do you think he would do this

2611
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,000
I need to ask you this question

2612
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,304
Alright

2613
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:47,840
Do you think Yoda would do so

2614
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:51,168
Bracelet that wwyd

2615
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,960
And I say

2616
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,496
Enough

2617
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:58,848
I don't like a very charismatic figure he might do a lot of different

2618
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,920
I know the Yoda spend a lot of time and

2619
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,968
Hanging out right that's a swamp

2620
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:04,736
Right

2621
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:08,064
A nerd to notice but I remember

2622
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:14,464
Okay swap for a long time just like soda holding his skills and being and hiding waiting for Luke

2623
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,512
Show up

2624
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,536
I'm sure he

2625
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:18,816
Just a little

2626
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:25,216
But he was practicing along along the way you

2627
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,240
Emperor Palpatine

2628
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,032
Darth Sidious

2629
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:34,432
He then had to retreat and escape from that but do you think there's a f****** chance you sitting around in that swamp and I'll practice

2630
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:37,760
I'm assuming there was this

2631
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:42,112
Lunch with his lightsaber in the game

2632
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:48,512
He did in the nuts

2633
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:53,632
The show it it's Ava had it real power doesn't need to be Flags

2634
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:01,824
What I'm saying lightsaber at dab

2635
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:02,592
Actually f******

2636
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:08,736
He did not do that

2637
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:10,784
Here's the issue

2638
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,576
The issue has had a lot of time on this

2639
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:14,880
That is because

2640
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:21,280
He could have started he could have started a YouTube series if you wanted to and that's how

2641
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,584
Now we know canadochly he wouldn't do that

2642
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,864
So

2643
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,912
Based on the Star Wars Canon

2644
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:28,960
Alex is correct Yoda would not

2645
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:29,728
That's true

2646
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,752
It is not a sign

2647
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:33,056
Here is this is not a psyop

2648
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:37,920
Logan Paul's video is not a psyop but that's the perfect Alex Jones things to say

2649
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,944
That is the perfect guy

2650
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:41,504
What is that asiop

2651
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,272
On

2652
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:52,256
The longest pause in the show's history I have no idea

2653
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:55,584
Hold on let me scroll it back I think it explains it a little bit

2654
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:58,400
And then make money off of it

2655
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,008
And do it while you're wearing a Yoda hat

2656
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:15,296
Okay

2657
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,112
This is what it's all about

2658
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,440
I know 100% what he's talking about

2659
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:28,352
Alex is pretending that Logan Paul wearing a Yoda

2660
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,376
Like

2661
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:30,656
Cartoony hat

2662
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,424
Is

2663
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,960
Some sort of a symbol

2664
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:33,728
That is

2665
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:35,264
To be like

2666
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,312
Aq2 the initiated

2667
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,592
Of what's going on

2668
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:41,664
Have you read that blog there's a Blog called Vigilant Citizen

2669
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,968
The answer before you even ask that question

2670
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,808
Is no there's a Blanco Vigilant Citizen is one of the biggest like

2671
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:49,344
Examples of this

2672
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,368
There's like

2673
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,440
Symbology runs the world

2674
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:57,536
Celebrities

2675
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:00,608
I know the name of the Rose

2676
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,168
The name of the Yoda

2677
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,704
But the rows do this

2678
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:09,568
But like celebrities putting one hand over their eyes

2679
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:14,176
Anyways for one example

2680
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:17,248
Blocking one of your eyes is a symbol of initiation

2681
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,296
Into the Illuminati

2682
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:21,856
That's something everybody knows their whatever

2683
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:22,880
Checkerboard

2684
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,672
Floors in a movie that's

2685
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:29,280
The cue to the initiated that like this is a million.

2686
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,328
I'm so I think it would Alex's

2687
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:33,120
Was trying to get at without having

2688
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:36,192
To spell it out because he knows his audience goes those blogs and

2689
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:40,800
They're into that conspiracy s*** to

2690
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,848
The fact that he wore his hat that

2691
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:46,688
Isn't is an indication to you that all this is

2692
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,968
The fuk fuk in

2693
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:48,736
Failure

2694
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,528
Fake

2695
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,600
Are you it's trying to f*** with

2696
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,392
Internal wisdom on it

2697
02:07:55,648 --> 02:08:00,000
Don't know if I understand correctly

2698
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:01,280
I suppose

2699
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,840
In regards to the turn wisdom on its head

2700
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,632
You got Gilda

2701
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,936
At the Hat symbol of wisdom hat

2702
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,984
Next to dead body

2703
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,288
Being warned

2704
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,848
Until you're turning wisdom on its head

2705
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:19,968
I already don't follow what you're saying

2706
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,248
No okay

2707
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:26,368
All right it was got this weird just saying elements of things

2708
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:28,160
Okay

2709
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:30,208
Yoda hat

2710
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:35,072
And then he goes and I don't know this is one story

2711
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,352
Like

2712
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,888
So many other stories

2713
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,912
Where I went

2714
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,984
Nah f*** this I don't give a s*** everybody can die

2715
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,520
As soon as I saw.

2716
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:49,920
Heart

2717
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:52,480
Everybody should die I saw this and I was like

2718
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:55,808
Orleans surprised by this

2719
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:58,368
Like at the escalation of people who need a 10

2720
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,392
Turn on YouTube is

2721
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:02,464
I mean there's a finite

2722
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:08,864
PewDiePie's already come out done Nazis what are you going to do

2723
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:14,240
Do you want

2724
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:18,848
The right there's no reason to think people wouldn't like

2725
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:22,944
Exploitative wouldn't take that to the next level

2726
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:26,016
Suicide Forest in Japan I can't remember the name

2727
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,040
Because I don't remember Devon

2728
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,320
Funny words

2729
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,856
That's a real place where you can

2730
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,624
Definitely

2731
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:33,440
You'll see a dead body if you go in there

2732
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:37,280
Weird yeah I mean I've read a bunch of stuff about it sentence like

2733
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,560
Yeah

2734
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:41,632
There's no culture in Japan is a whole different

2735
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:42,400
Wild

2736
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:44,448
There's no

2737
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,984
Situation wherein

2738
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:46,752
He could have

2739
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,032
I have embarked on

2740
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:50,336
Wood

2741
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:52,896
Soleil

2742
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,432
Or it's unplanned

2743
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:58,528
It's not but we don't need to unpack that it's about what Alex is saying

2744
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,928
We are to follow along with what Alex

2745
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,232
Yoda

2746
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:08,000
The Yoda

2747
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,536
Is the symbol of wisdom

2748
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:11,840
Turning on its head

2749
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:14,656
By going into an

2750
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,936
A clearly

2751
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:16,704
Exploited

2752
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:19,520
Right having an a******

2753
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:22,336
Steer dead body and do whatever he did

2754
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,896
Yoda

2755
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,176
Our symbol of wisdom

2756
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,456
Is then

2757
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,480
Associate

2758
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:30,784
With the a****** doing whatever he did

2759
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,576
Well in that case

2760
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:36,672
You see that symbol of wisdom and go well wisdom

2761
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:39,488
And so destroyed

2762
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:40,256
Wisdom

2763
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,352
Like I mean go with the more classical Simba

2764
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,888
Why would you go to the classic

2765
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:49,216
Millennials

2766
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:55,872
Because they f****** use the Eye of Horus

2767
02:10:56,896 --> 02:11:03,040
Millennials are going to Vibe with

2768
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:04,832
YouTube starting then I left my phone on

2769
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,368
Like I was done

2770
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,928
I think it's fascinating that Alex

2771
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:09,696
I mean

2772
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:10,720
It's clear that is

2773
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:11,744
Complaints come from

2774
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,512
About like

2775
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:16,864
Video wire

2776
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,680
That that certainly is in play

2777
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:20,960
I meant

2778
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:24,032
I think the issue again for Alex was

2779
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:26,592
And Alex Jones

2780
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:31,712
Justin

2781
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,480
A hat

2782
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:33,760
Of Alex Jones

2783
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,784
With his mouth

2784
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,064
Right here and then is

2785
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:40,160
Okay you pull on a little coordinate screams at people

2786
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:44,512
Like one of those like one of those cards where you open it and go

2787
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:46,816
I love you like that guy

2788
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,936
Now I want to know Alex Jones

2789
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:55,520
Do we have endless resources

2790
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:56,800
Things we could make

2791
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:01,152
WWE bad ideas we could make reality that as it may

2792
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,176
I'm

2793
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:03,456
F******

2794
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:04,736
Flummox

2795
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:07,296
Buy everything that I was

2796
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,600
Because

2797
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:13,440
You should be supporting

2798
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,208
Logan Paul

2799
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,744
Based on his philosophy

2800
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,792
There's nothing that he did

2801
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:19,072
Fit breeches

2802
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,352
Free speech

2803
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:22,656
He was in Japan

2804
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,680
Right

2805
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,984
Which is already your onboard

2806
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:29,824
Give a s*** you don't give a s*** about that person who died in that Forest

2807
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:35,200
Rhetorical points all the time

2808
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:38,272
Breitbart

2809
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,296
Yeah you said that

2810
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:41,088
Steve Bannon came into the bunch of money

2811
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:42,880
Disgraced breitbarth reputation

2812
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:46,208
I mean he's using Breitbart as a tool

2813
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:48,768
Perfect using Andrew Breitbart

2814
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:50,304
And now he's at a cabana

2815
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,352
Their diet

2816
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:54,400
Right

2817
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,704
I don't I don't think

2818
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,496
Necessarily there's any law

2819
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,080
Videotaping a dead body

2820
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
I mean

2821
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,688
I don't know

2822
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:10,016
I don't know I don't obviously there's no

2823
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:13,600
Yeah exact

2824
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:14,880
Obviously that's not

2825
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:17,184
I mean there's always going to be a fast

2826
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,512
Shark with really f***** up

2827
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:24,352
I'm just saying people just like

2828
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:25,632
There's a

2829
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:28,448
I don't know I've never felt

2830
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,472
Humanistic

2831
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:33,824
Dudayev somebody when I was in high school was like let's watch faces of death

2832
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:37,152
Let's turn you into one of those faces of death

2833
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:37,920
I don't want to see that

2834
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,968
Is it gross and wrong

2835
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,504
Would you going to do

2836
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,088
Take some sort of high ground it's just I f*** you I don't need

2837
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:48,672
Go to the other room

2838
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:49,952
Yeah

2839
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:52,256
No no no

2840
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:55,072
Yeah

2841
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:58,144
Your argument there is a fascination with some

2842
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:58,912
I would argue

2843
02:13:59,168 --> 02:13:59,936
They're f***** up by

2844
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:06,592
Yeah sure we watch videos and stuff

2845
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:09,920
Cast now is my favorite murder and all they do is talk about

2846
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:12,992
Serial killers like that

2847
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:14,016
Psychology that's

2848
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:14,784
Then

2849
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,064
Actually watching

2850
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:22,208
Dead bodies are actually watching people die in the actual death is different than

2851
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,256
The circumstances that surrounded

2852
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,536
The clues the

2853
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:28,352
Psychology

2854
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:33,216
I just I just don't think it's a fake if I don't get some sort of

2855
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:39,616
Call instead of like wandering into a dead body and then started laughing and clowning a little bit

2856
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,712
Off-camera found dead body

2857
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:45,760
And then stay Brazil whole thing

2858
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:48,320
Ortona respectfully sort of

2859
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,856
Guide disgust

2860
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,672
The experience of it

2861
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:54,720
And then also was like

2862
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:59,584
There's a note buy it cuz a lot of people who kill themselves in that note

2863
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:06,240
There is a way that he could have done it in a my favorite murder

2864
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:10,848
Dial Lori Cahill Style

2865
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:12,896
Respectful to the person who died cuz they didn't

2866
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:15,200
Consent to be a part of his stunts

2867
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:15,968
Or whatever

2868
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:19,296
How to position

2869
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,832
I think it would

2870
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:23,648
Respectful to the people who

2871
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:24,416
Cared about the

2872
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,976
The moment you die

2873
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:31,328
You don't give you don't you don't exist so go f***

2874
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,144
I'm not I'm not clear I agree with you on that but it's

2875
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:36,960
It's absolutely

2876
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,752
I think that you're right

2877
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:40,032
Do extend after death

2878
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:41,312
22in

2879
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:50,528
Desecrate your course that already has concession

2880
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:05,120
The issue

2881
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,912
I mean there's a lot of issues

2882
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:09,472
And a lot of them are are really

2883
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:10,752
Really Salient about

2884
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:12,800
Like the idea of going in

2885
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:15,104
In case so much more

2886
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:15,872
Who You Are

2887
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,408
That's probably

2888
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:18,176
But

2889
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:19,200
I don't think

2890
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:21,248
I don't think it's

2891
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,784
Sara Lee YouTube

2892
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,552
Placer

2893
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:25,856
Anyone anyone in charge supplies

2894
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:26,624
How to say

2895
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:27,648
I will send

2896
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:30,720
Yeah I'm 90%

2897
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,000
On that side

2898
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,792
I'm also

2899
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:35,584
Write a hundred percent

2900
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:36,608
That's our

2901
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:39,936
Rue21 take myself out about 7

2902
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:43,264
Because I do think that Grace

2903
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:45,568
I think I think I think

2904
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:48,896
I don't think that governing bodies should be able to tell you what you

2905
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:52,736
But I think we're much more active

2906
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:54,016
Punishing people

2907
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:56,064
Ford stuff that is.

2908
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:57,600
Not this tasteful

2909
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,368
But

2910
02:16:58,624 --> 02:16:59,136
Raw

2911
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,416
Like

2912
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,184
There's a

2913
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,464
I think I think

2914
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:05,536
Skittles McAdoo

2915
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,304
And not

2916
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:07,584
Okay

2917
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,120
Both are distasteful

2918
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:09,888
What is

2919
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,472
Which one

2920
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:20,384
F*** you

2921
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:22,176
Wind-up going back to it like in this

2922
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:23,200
Particular circumstance

2923
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,992
I think I start from the

2924
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,016
The place of

2925
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:27,040
As we've

2926
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:29,088
Discuss before with our friend

2927
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:32,928
Being rich is a morally question

2928
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:37,024
How strict wealth are doing

2929
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:41,888
All the way back there and say being

2930
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:43,168
Stars immorally

2931
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:47,776
I mean it's a decision that he made

2932
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:48,800
The child and parent

2933
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:50,592
Sort of reinforced in it

2934
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:57,248
It went to actually like

2935
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:00,064
Logan Paul

2936
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:02,624
Interesting that we can stop here but

2937
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:05,440
Iprint

2938
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:07,488
That made we all agree with the sentiment but she

2939
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,280
You just summed it up so perfectly with you

2940
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,840
Being wealthy

2941
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:12,608
Choice right

2942
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,912
French

2943
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,960
All of the all of the words are perfect

2944
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:23,360
Nailed it look her up on Twitter cuz she wrote a very very salient

2945
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:26,432
Concise essay about Logan Paul and about what

2946
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:28,480
Embodies

2947
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:30,784
And there is a lot of that like white

2948
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,320
Privilege

2949
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:38,720
That white male privilege wouldn't think for a second that this is wrong to do a

2950
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,000
We're sailing away then we can do

2951
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:41,536
Very much

2952
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:46,144
Let's jump off this and just say it's f***** up at Alex Jones doesn't support him

2953
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:49,728
Cuz it's bright support face

2954
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:51,008
And

2955
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:51,776
I think that's just

2956
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:52,800
I don't know why

2957
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,080
Figure out

2958
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:01,760
To get more views

2959
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:04,064
That's where we get back to

2960
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:07,392
Recycling let's not let's let's kick out of it

2961
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:11,744
Justin say that Alex Jones Brian stelter

2962
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,792
Stupid but at the same time

2963
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:15,328
Yeah makes no sense

2964
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:17,376
Boring

2965
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,680
These other things

2966
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:21,984
Trump being like William Wallace

2967
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:28,896
Wolf

2968
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:35,296
I think we talked with We've Ended in the same place we started on the Google earned that

2969
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:36,832
I don't think we learned anything

2970
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:37,856
I think that's where we got back

2971
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:43,232
