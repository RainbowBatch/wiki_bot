1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
Policy wonk

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,816
Everybody didn't hear

3
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,840
Hi I'm Jordan

4
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,888
Hey how's it going buddy

5
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,704
Just wanted to

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,288
To give you a little bit of taking this Friday

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:17,408
Off from an episode but we will be back on Monday so much again handled and terms

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,432
The move

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,760
Yeah I mean a lot of it I was able to take care of

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,832
And gradually do but there is

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,856
Blindsided by

12
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,904
Various things are so much

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Somebody

14
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
Counts to move over like I know stuff

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,608
It so it's it's a lot so I'm I'm just going to take a 1-1 off me day here

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,192
Absolutely I think that's a great idea

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,776
You should definitely take the day off and

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
Clean off your sound

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
For god sakes get the compressed air for what

20
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
Tell me what to do with my soundboard

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
Cuz if you do

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
Dammit don't

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
Tell me what to do

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,208
Anyone in the movie

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,048
Pavement

26
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
I wish I had that we could do

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Stupid episode but

28
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,264
I'll be back on Monday and everything and I think it everybody who's been so supportive and kind about

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
Telling me to take a week off

30
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
And just people being like that excited for the new

31
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
New place in

32
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
The new patch

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
New animal friend

34
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,344
Which I think I've made a decision on which will be forthcoming now you're teasing

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,976
I'm not fully made this decision but I'm bleeding very heavily in One Direction

36
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,792
Actually shocked the world

37
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
The world

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Yes

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Anyway for the shelter website has been updated

40
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
My food reviews

41
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,384
Shuffle let's do a little bit of what you got

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
I tried this last week or so

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Well

44
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
I don't know baby

45
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,088
I expect you both to be terrible

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Pop-Tarts

47
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Pop-Tarts which kind

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Froot Loops

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
Get the f*** out of get the f*** out of single pack at the corner store

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
I agree

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
I don't like

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
I don't like Pop-Tarts to begin with

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
I think the trash

54
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,336
I hate them I think I have food

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
Delivered to your house

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,920
I think most of them are

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
Glorified candy or whatever

58
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Looking hot fudge sundae

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Although I will eat those

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,744
For dessert maybe them in brown sugar is the only way to go as a breakfast maybe it's more

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Fruit punch

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Super crazy

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Is beyond

64
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
So I grabbed them

65
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
Expected to be terrible

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,712
And then I did what I always do with Pop Tarts just cut off the edges cuz it's too much

67
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
The pastry distress

68
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
I didn't know about you

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
What they cut the edges of the doctor

70
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
No

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Naughty

72
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
Really good

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,472
Really good I hate this is really good. Really good I don't want for breakfast

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,800
It was shockingly close to fruit

75
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,408
Flavor of the inside the filling was gooey

76
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah but it tasted like

77
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
And then because of the

78
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Frosting on top

79
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
That recreated

80
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
Did the sort of sugary Vibe of the hyperloop

81
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,256
I thought it was very accurate to a fruit and I felt really ashamed

82
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Afterwards

83
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:50,656
I guess now that you said that

84
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
I got to give it up to the Somali pirates

85
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Accurate

86
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
I don't like

87
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
I don't like

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Transforming text

89
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
I don't like the same taste turning into a different text

90
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
I need the

91
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Texture to match up

92
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
If I taste a fruit loop

93
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Play better be crunchy

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
I don't disagree with you as a whole

95
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
But

96
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
I went in expecting garbage

97
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
And it wasn't that bad so I applaud

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
New oreo on the scene

99
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
But I found

100
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,191
Tiramisu Oreo 10 are these people crazy

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
So you're the happen

102
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
I got that got home

103
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
I grabbed one of these Oreos out

104
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,783
As I was eating it I realize I don't think I've ever had tiramisu

105
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
Not that I can remember

106
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,631
Did it taste like that's the question I can't answer

107
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
Not great taste

108
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Great

109
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Nobody's nobody's ever been like

110
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687
My God I need a Tiramisu right

111
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Been awhile

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
God I need a therapist or am I just got out of the bar

113
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
Cannoli

114
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
Yeah it was really interesting experience for me

115
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
To have that realization

116
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Mid Oreos it like

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,935
He hasn't had with this is pretending to be free

118
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Could be dead-on could be

119
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383
It could be a lot I could give the middle finger to the Swedish Fish Oreo

120
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Swedish Fish

121
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Oreo

122
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
On our way back

123
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
Yeah what was the other one

124
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
India

125
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Pop Rocks

126
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
You like that pop rocks

127
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
I don't like pop rocks

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Alone

129
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,143
Incorporate something like an Oreo

130
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
It's pretty excited

131
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Just a Sprinkle that pisses me off

132
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
Okay it's an aggressive sprinkle sprinkle

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Fruit Loop Pop-Tarts

134
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
I need a Raley's I would say what it is is it

135
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,903
Seated my expectations and pleasantly surprised me giving advice to people who are trying

136
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
If you're interested in that give it

137
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
Does not disappoint

138
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
If you really like tiramisu

139
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,935
Maybe it's later this I couldn't tell you

140
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,311
You don't like tiramisu

141
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
The regular Oreos

142
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Maybe I don't know

143
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,503
This is been my novelty Food review and George

144
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
The joy that

145
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
We got to get out of

146
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
Thanks for your patience everyone out there we really appreciate it and once we're all settled

147
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,071
Everything will be so spectacular and there'll be a new pad

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
I will talk to you

149
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Right

150
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Yes we will
