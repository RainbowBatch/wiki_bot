1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B. I'm sick of him posing as if

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
Put the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864
Alex Jones

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,192
Quick question for you today

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,336
My bright spot Dan is it is the beginning today as we speak of us Summer Games Done Quick

9
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,176
And it is the first time they've been in live

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,760
Grouping situate iPad that's how I

11
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
Better whatever it is with a real audience

12
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,648
Since since

13
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
The thing that happened I watched a little bit of it

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
It's fantastic

15
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,096
Lily is heartwarming

16
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Well and it's for Doctors Without Borders

17
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Add stop by.

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
I am blown away by

19
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,456
I mean just even people who are good at video game video game

20
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
Not that good at them

21
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
So people who are good

22
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
Worry me

23
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,392
People who are able to do those

24
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Speedrun games

25
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Yeah seems like that would

26
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,376
A long time of sucking up water to get right

27
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
Very impressed

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
But

29
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,264
You're obscuring a lot of stuff

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,104
A lot of time spent like

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
Screaming it

32
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
A deck of cards video games

33
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
You get to see it end

34
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
Because you can play a video game at least at a at a basic level you know

35
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
You can really see

36
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
How amazing they must be

37
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
The really good ones are

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Imagine

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
You can't even think about

40
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Playing the sax

41
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
The phone you got no idea to make your fingers do that s***

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
How the f*** do they do that you don't got to read how do you put your mouth on that thing

43
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
Even with the second one I guess I can't even conceive of that difficulty

44
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Kind of be like

45
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
Wow is relatable yeah it

46
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,904
I guess that's an indictment of Our Generation

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
And everyone can relate to video game

48
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,560
Today my bright spot is you notes

49
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,120
3B creamy summer everyone knows this

50
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
It is taking the World by storm

51
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,080
The beginning of this year we've had conversations about this privately

52
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
To find a way to make it

53
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,968
Me and a little bit more than just me eating ice cream

54
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
There was an idea that I had

55
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Each month

56
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,136
Of the dream creamy summer we would

57
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Support a charity

58
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
Of some sort out something like that

59
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
You know I think that things

60
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Kept happening

61
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
And

62
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Kept being like well this is what we

63
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Support

64
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Is right

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Oh the overwhelming

66
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
And everything here things kept happen

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
The first time we talked about it was like

68
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
3 days before we were going to go to Austin for the trial

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
Probably that whole thing happened

70
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Ever since then it's been one f***

71
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
Something after enough

72
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,976
Yes yeah finally decided to make a move on this and

73
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
So what I have done

74
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,351
Is I've we've started a Kickstarter

75
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,655
Kick-starting starter

76
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
If you get 10 bill

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
There's a GoFundMe

78
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
Set up fundraisers for a charity of your choice

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
And there is a charity called apiary that is involved with logistical and practical support

80
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
For people who are looking

81
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
For Reproductive care

82
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,231
And so what I have decided to do is set up a dreamy creamy summer

83
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
Fundraiser you can find I think if you just search gofundme.com dreamy creamy summer I think it

84
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
Should come up that's what I change the name to

85
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,823
Obviously on the episode but yeah

86
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
I ate some

87
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
I don't know

88
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,503
Make some positive attitude Sports

89
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,599
Org

90
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,439
Hopefully

91
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Helping

92
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Yes

93
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Episode

94
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Turn on purpose

95
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,663
Don't mean to do this yeah 22 also known as

96
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
What a day

97
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,575
What a day how do you want to put a day like that of course

98
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
Is David learn that

99
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
It was official that the Supreme Court was overturning Roe versus Wade

100
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,959
That second part will not factor into this episode because Alex was on there

101
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
We have Alex's immediate response to the news that Rohit been overturned

102
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Yeah I think

103
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
A lot of people might

104
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
Expect something a little different

105
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Then what actually

106
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
I mean I think people might expect I don't know ticker tape parade

107
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
3 hour long

108
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
Remix of You Belong To The City 3 hours

109
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
That that's

110
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
Probably

111
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,127
Some of it's interesting some of its not and we'll get into it here in the moment the first

112
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223

A list for me

135
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
And then we're going

136
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
To come back

137
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
And I'm going to

138
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Start the show over

139
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
F*** you

140
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
F*** you

141
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
I got plenty work for you but

142
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
At the end of the day

143
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
F*** you and your new world order

144
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
She wrote in on

145
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
And all your s***

146
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Maybe the Nashville on West Broad

147
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

148
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
I'm Yours

149
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Walk out of here tomorrow

150
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
And you never see me again

151
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Really what I want to do

152
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Back here again

153
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
I apologized

154
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

155
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Better tomorrow

156
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
He's not

157
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
Alex

158
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
So we start off the episode

159
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,975
Alex comes in with music that I don't know I wouldn't say that he's never played this I'm not sure but it is

160
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,071
Definitely not a normal song The Way by Fastball

161
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
It's an INXS song

162
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Okay

163
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,471
That somehow even more weird

164
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
Especially for like

165
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
Here's a pretty short list of like the

166
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Beginning of the show Bumper Music

167
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,663
So this is a little bit weird the vibe is just off

168
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
What

169
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
Oh they're scared freedom is rising

170
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
Human intention is increasing to Manatee is Awakening

171
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,319
Tacoma

172
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,783
Are you trying to DJ a prom

173
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,135
Why am I angry already it's very strange

174
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
Goddamn

175
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,279
Slow dance at bulshit what is happening notable

176
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
Vibe shift wow

177
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
It's not what you'd expect

178
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
Hello it's me

179
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,991
If this were the case in his own life when he was younger

180
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
We would never have had to deal with any of his bowls

181
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
Well we'll get to that a little bit later okay

182
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,999
I believe that but before we do

183
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
Big day for Alex

184
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
And here

185
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Supreme Court decision

186
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
Why did the Supreme Court do the right thing and

187
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Overturn Roe v Wade

188
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
That we have

189
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
3D modeling

It's over 75 to 80% of people

Intensifying

198
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Would the youngest generation

199
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,855
What's the story about why the court overturn Roe v Wade is absolute trash

200
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,951
They did not determine that fetuses are babies based on 3D modeling or whatever

201
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:19,583
The f*** Alex is saying because if they did determine that then they would have made a ruling that decided that states can just decide

202
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
If they want to allow murder

203
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
And that isn't what they did

204
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
No they didn't

205
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,775
This decision that they made is a flagrant violation of many people's rights

206
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
And there will be cases

207
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
Ad nauseam

208
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
Challenging abortion laws

209
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
And various States

210
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
We will see how

211
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
Yeah number of Base

212
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:46,463
I was reading about from the congregation Ladora Fedora Jewish

213
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,535
A progressive Jewish synagogue in Florida

214
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
I bet

215
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,631
I was getting a bit of coverage and

216
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
I think I think

217
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
Produces some interesting question

218
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
I'm just so bored

219
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
Them having to

220
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Pretend

221
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
Now that they still have to pay

222
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Pretend write a note

223
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,991
It says we want you to cancel abortion in this place

224
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,831
Why are you going to pretend to have words that make sense in-laws

225
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
They're all

226
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Did you read their f******

227
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Cramps

228
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
Nonsense in those decisions

229
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,279
Does like hey you know I know but took them

230
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
That's what the depiction said they didn't say was a result 3D modeling of dancing bear

231
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,543
They don't need that anymore they don't need any excuses the Galaxy some NyQuil and watched a Lima

232
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
Bellini baby baby

233
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,063
Angry too Alex is also completely wrong about the general population's feelings about abortion

234
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Hinge

235
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
2021 Gallup poll

236
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,255
Found a record-high approval rating for abortion with 47% saying it was morally acceptable

237
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
48

238
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
Recite wanted abortion with limit

239
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
32%

240
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,167
Completely legal and only 19% thought it

241
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
It should be illegal

242
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,775
Pew research found a 2022 poll that among the

243
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
Younger demographic

244
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Between 8

245
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
18 + 29

246
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
74% supported abortion

247
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Being legal

248
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
And in fact it was older people who were license

249
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
What

250
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,111
54% of those 65 and up supported legal

251
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
Alex is lying and the reason is fairly obvious

252
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
How long abortion even on a state level is

253
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,327
The pretty unpopular idea among the general population

254
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
The only group

255
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:34,751
Really his strong opinions in that direction are Conservative Republican

256
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,335
These are really the only groups whose opinions Alex thinks

257
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
Help so the world that

258
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
He creates for his audience to experience is real

259
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
Is a world where those positions held by those groups

260
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Are projected onto everyone

261
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
That's what he's doing

262
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
I'm here and he's

263
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Literally in

264
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Converting

265
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
The

266
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Yeah like this group 18 to 29 is 74% in favor of abortion right now it's saying 75

267
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
The 80%

268
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Of the youth

269
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
Opposed to it

270
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:11,615
That's very possibly just misreading but either way it's still in a

271
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
You can't possibly believe that if

272
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
You better young person

273
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,087
I don't I don't think it's a misreading I think it's a understanding that he's already

274
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
We'll adopt

275
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Whatever

276
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
That the sort of

277
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Characteristics of reality

278
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
He presented to them and it is nice for them to be like

279
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Awesome

280
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
The Next Generation

281
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
Totally on my side so validate that I've had enough

282
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
Generation is coming around tonight

283
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
And it's just not true

284
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
It's very sad salute

285
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Anyway there was another Supreme Court

286
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,015
Decision that I was about to New York

287
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Concealed carry

288
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Laws

289
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Spell

290
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,511
Alex is thrilled about that decision to imagine that one is more likely to get a ticker-tape parade

291
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Confusing

292
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Paradox tour

293
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Apocracy in the

294
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Just on a whim

295
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Much of the

296
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
Slavery legal again

297
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Historically

298
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
What does that mean

299
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
We all know deep down

300
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
He is true

301
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
But they gone

302
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
And there are

303
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
What's the party stage

304
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
This is why I had occasion to important it was 350

305
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,191
Wow everything is a state right until it's not

306
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
Free fun

307
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:20,127
Play cuz I mean you know that whole 10th Amendment movement that Alex was so into 4

308
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
Years and years campaigning it so

309
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Thoroughly when

310
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Democrat

311
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
It's where an office and what-have-you

312
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
Kicking to the state

313
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
All the powers that are relegated by the fans

314
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Fusion

315
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
And

316
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
You know.

317
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Concealed carry

318
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
Seems like that should be a state issue according to Alex's beliefs

319
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
But who

320
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
Well I mean it would be it would be gauche of the democratic party or really anybody to point

321
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Clean outside

322
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
They only change the venue whenever they're losing

323
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
So if they're winning in the federal government and states rights do matter but if they're losing in the federal government

324
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,415
It's almost like they're just short sore losers or

325
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
No

326
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Not quitters

327
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Bring up here

328
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
The first is that states insisting they had a right to allow slavery is what caused the Civil War and Alex's ancestors

329
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Put on the side of the people who wanted

330
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,543
Needs to be able to enslave people

331
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
This would be a quirk of family history normally but Alex's frequently brags about being related to

332
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Confederate generals

333
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,599
Also he believes that he's literally his ancestors so if his belief system means anything

334
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
He fought for the

335
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Conspiracy

336
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
At least spiritually

337
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
Second Alex's position is inco

338
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,791
Because he's misleading about his act

339
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
Position

340
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
He doesn't believe that abortion should be a question left up

341
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
To the states

342
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
He knows that's a position he should have

343
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Based on his fake libertarian politics

344
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
His actual position is that he wants

345
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
What's the federal government to ban all the

346
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,223
Because for all the Fanfare he has about how the government is evil

347
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,063
If he feels that the power of the state can be used against his perceived enemies

348
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
He makes peace with the feds real thing

349
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Yeah it seems like it have

350
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Almost

351
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,279
Immediately if you believe that abortion is murder than you can't believe the state's right to

352
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
Pure and simple

353
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:21,727
The people like Alex of used to obscure their actual agenda is and make it easier to trick people into thinking

354
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:28,127
But they were more moderate than they actually are also States should be able to decide whether or not murders

355
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
Fine check what the f*** are you talking

356
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
It is buckled

357
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
It is you know

358
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
It's the way to convince

359
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
People who

360
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Would just rather not

361
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
That's more what it is

362
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
It's not like

363
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,047
Tricking people into believing that they're better it's

364
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Just more like

365
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
Oh he said that woman I just don't have to think about it I can

366
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Just leave them alone

367
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,495
I'm sure you know his murder is a strong emotional trigger

368
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
And

369
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
States rights issue

370
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Effuse

371
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,687
Do some of that maybe make some think that you're not involved in people's Act

372
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,271
Play ultimately want to roll back all sorts of things right all the way to

373
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,647
Sodomy laws contraception being illegal abortion is legal in Illinois

374
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:17,791
If Texas wants to ban abortion no big deal except for it's not going to be that much longer before it's banned everywhere

375
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
This clip has nothing to do with anything

376
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
I just thought it was weird

377
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,543
Soylent Green

378
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
That piece coming up

379
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
Hey my man

380
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:50,047
Knowing what's out there

381
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
How come you didn't

382
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,887
Well at all

383
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
Bulshit

384
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
That guy I honestly don't

385
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
Care what Alex thinks about David

386
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,687
Saying stuff like that makes me think of you. I actually kind of like the guy

387
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
What

388
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Absolutely

389
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
Least weird

390
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Hey

391
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Where

392
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
Politically aligned in a different way than our

393
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
Aeropostale

394
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
I mean for now Pub

395
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,424
Play yes I would you say that you have

396
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Become a Satanist

397
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
Do you worship the devil

398
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
I mean I don't really worship anybody

399
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,640
The larger issue I have with the world

400
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
You're in the minority of wildly I disagree without

401
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,488
Operating system in Ariba National

402
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
Nationals documentary

403
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
A large portion of Democrats identify as Satanist

404
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,664
This is about selfishness about devaluing human life

405
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
This is a big victory for

406
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
Share articles and videos

407
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,768
City of evil and Corruption and collapsing borders V volume

408
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Humanity is

409
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Coming back

410
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Humanities

411
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Coming back

412
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
It's going

413
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
It's progressing

414
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Humanities going away

415
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
That's what you manatees doing

416
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,088
Eventually

417
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
Yeah I don't I think that Alex is talking about hail Satan

418
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,560
Cuz that's a documentary that he's brought up a number of times

419
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,632
Okay alright

420
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
You think that

421
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
I mean I'm just guessing

422
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
I'm here but I would assume that most

423
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Most of the people

424
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
In the satanic temple

425
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
They

426
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,712
Describe the politics or believe in electoralism

427
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,784
Would probably be more likely to be Democratic and Republican

428
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,832
I like they might be saying

429
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,184
Taking that from the documentary and then assuming that all Democrats are

430
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
This is this is

431
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
Yeah well I mean it makes sense to Alex

432
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
To think that there would be a church

433
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Satan

434
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Right

435
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Because

436
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Titans real

437
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Okay

438
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
But there is

439
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Right but

440
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,664
He means it in one way and be the thing about a Church of Satan

441
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,552
Is if you want a literal Church of Satan than those people also have to believe everything in the Bible is true

442
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
And they don't believe that

443
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
It's an ironic point that their makeup

444
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Enough

445
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
I just got a funny image of Alec

446
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Text thinking like

447
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
If there is a Church of Satan they meet in like

448
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,376
Cave

449
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,680
Only like we have rugs

450
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
We do the whole thing

451
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,776
We sacrifice something we light a fire

452
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
I mean

453
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,432
But even then he doesn't know that modern Satanist we've got those candles that you're there just electricity man

454
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,784
If LED TV screen

455
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Soylent

456
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
But so you want to take it out

457
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Pretty specific

458
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Narrow issue

459
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
I will

460
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
The number out

461
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,168
Specifically on Roe v Wade

462
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
What do you think the pitfalls are and what is the left

463
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,056
Violence and Vengeance and insurrection

464
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
I mean first of all what the f*** do you think your audio

465
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
But second

466
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
Obsession and preoccupation

467
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
That we saw all over right with media

468
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Of

469
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
Framing the story as

470
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
The left is going to be viola

471
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,096
And I think that that is a wonderful way for them to delegitimize protest

472
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
From left

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
And

474
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,056
Yeah he's on the Vanguard of that stuff but these are the talking points that he uses all the

475
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
The time

476
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
That his

477
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,688
I guess become acceptable for people like Tucker and

478
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Other

479
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Folks to use

480
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
The tragedy

481
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
The Democrats from actually

482
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Doing anything

483
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,208
You know is they they're they're like the Democrats are going to be like

484
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
And then you know

485
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
It's going to be a good

486
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,704
Three years that we're going to have

487
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
I think two

488
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
There's a priming

489
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
People who might counter-protest

490
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Folks

491
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:57,760
I liked on the GOP and the anti-choice if you're going to counter-protest to make sure your arm

492
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,600
Heightening of tensions

493
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
Expectation

494
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
It's just right out of the gate

495
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
From entering things with that headspace

496
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,840
Cuz the idea is that they've escalated before you even got there

497
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Right

498
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
I mean it's just a preoccupation

499
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,200
Respond

500
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:33,600
Call Zack

501
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Demonic

502
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
Drunk on the blood of children

503
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Avenue Sacramento

504
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
Taken away

505
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
You know

506
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Hit anytime

507
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,888
Familiar cues I think we've I think we've made a huge mistake

508
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
This entire time

509
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
I'm re-evaluating

510
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,264
Moved into cities we should

511
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,664
Just stay that mean the trees absolutely we never should have come down from there I would have argued that the ocean would

512
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,552
Probably been better

513
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Clarinet

514
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,696
I'm sorry we're just telling us what they're afraid of

515
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,280
Maybe if we just leaned into their fears they just run away

516
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,352
So we all have to become Satanist Satanist

517
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:21,984
We are blood all over and run towards conservative

518
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,824
I honestly think well here's

519
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,176
It might be fun as a thing to try

520
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
There is a

521
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
Problem of what

522
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
You do then

523
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,624
Well it is not a long-term political solution

524
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Kind of structural

525
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Plan

526
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
Involved in

527
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,560
Yelling

528
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
Yeah

529
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Get some sort of a response out of

530
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
The truth

531
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,496
So Alex isn't confusing ideas about abortion

532
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
This really didn't

533
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Makes sense.

534
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,480
Other states to have these abortions on that other countries

535
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
We as a people are

536
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,440
Master and he's alive

537
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,840
And there are the arguments they have

538
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
Early abortions if they were really just doing it

539
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
A person's poor or

540
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,152
It's done because they loved Anthony value in him and himself

541
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,040
I think it's weird that Alex seems to

542
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Be presenting

543
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,136
These rare situations are ones where

544
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,976
You know maybe it could be okay get an abortion early

545
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
In cases of rape or if you're poor

546
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
That's strange

547
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
Well I mean it is strange considering that we

548
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,008
With this ruling the only people who won't be able to get abortions are for

549
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
It's almost the opposite

550
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
It's weird for any kind of conditional

551
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Because

552
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
If you believe the things he pretends to believe you can't

553
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
You can't

554
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,440
Murder people if you're poor I mean are you talkin about

555
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Listen okay

556
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Abortion is murder

557
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,816
And you can have one if your poo

558
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
So if you have too many kids say like

559
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
Between the ages of 5 and 45

560
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
If you're poor

561
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,824
If if Alex

562
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Believe

563
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,688
Any of the things that he saying I don't understand how he would know

564
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
Rationalize one being okay but not the other mouths to feed so I'm going to kill it and I'm

565
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:49,184
Going to drape myself in its blood and the Run doors Alex

566
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,072
Fail to see how this could be a position he's taking

567
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
I'm seriously at all if he has his belief

568
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,192
So I went to As We Know

569
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
Has been involved in a lot of abortion

570
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
Do you have paid for a lot of them

571
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
Believe in 2050

572
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Team that we found

573
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
He was talking

574
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,504
Think about paying for abortions for women who even

575
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Didn't want to

576
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
To get them

577
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,600
Pressured them into abortion

578
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,184
F****** weird but here he

579
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
Backup this

580
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
His past with abortion

581
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
Man there's just some things that it's

582
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Don't

583
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Fit

584
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
I was extremely promiscuous when I was young

585
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
And did not have any trouble with the ladies

586
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
And

587
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
Abortions in a lot of women

588
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
A lot of murders involving a lot of murders

589
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
My dad's a murderer

590
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
I just moved out

591
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,120
I got a job I need some more money

592
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,240
I just gave you money for an abortion a month

593
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
What is your problem

594
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
Stop killing my

595
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,128
That's why I need money

596
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
And he was just like you're out of control

597
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
I want to shop

598
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
For several years and

599
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
Soon as I stop

600
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
Just chasing women around

601
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Then

602
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
My mission basic

603
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Materialize

604
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
So we've talked

605
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,200
It's 100 times a repeating particularly on a day like this that Alex Jones of all people

606
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:50,272
Should understand the importance of having access to reproductive Healthcare

607
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,088
If the world he wants to exist

608
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,648
Existed when he was younger he wouldn't be Alex Jones

609
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
No one would know who he was he wouldn't have

610
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
Career and the globalist to be running around

611
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Completely on a pole

612
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
In order for him to be able to carry out his allegedly

613
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,680
Play Holy mission of fighting Klaus Schwab or whoever you

614
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
He reveals to

615
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
The big bad guy

616
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
Season Alex needed

617
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Did the two have access to

618
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:18,944
Also the story about his dad is something we've heard Alex start telling fairly recently but really let the

619
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736
Details of that story sink in

620
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,392
Alex was so irresponsible and it was such a routine thing that his dad knew he needed money for an abortion just

621
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
Because Alex asked him for money

622
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:35,072
The right-wing will often accuse people who support abortion of being irresponsible and using it as his control but

623
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,376
Seems like that's more something that Alex did

624
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
It's

625
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
A little bit weird

626
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
I mean

627
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
Hysen

628
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,664
I did well with the women and wasn't trying to get people yes you were

629
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,736
No no there's no way to know how people get pregnant

630
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
Biewer Yorkie

631
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,880
You're being irresponsible I mean what is he going to do use a condom

632
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,488
The f****** part isn't the problem is people if they're on the pill

633
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
What's he going to do

634
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,400
No he's got to get in there and it just like Onan was told by God

635
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
You got to keep that crap in there

636
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
Don't let it Outlook leaving all this aside for a moment Alex can straight-up go f*** himself if he wants me to believe his b******* about him get

637
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
Celibate that's being like when the mission

638
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Became clear

639
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,016
He needs to get his Cosmic and spiritual back story straight because this thing is

640
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Full of holes

641
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:32,928
Is that school and so he got celibate and then his mission began

642
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,560
None dare call it conspiracy alligator 12 and that woke him up to the New World Order and started just calling

643
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
And I thought he was younger is dead buddies over to talk about their insane anti-communist bulshit

644
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,032
Alex knew all about this from a young age

645
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,688
I thought he was a Satanist for a while and then try to record it. They tried to recruit him into Satanism and he saw 3

646
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
Through it and that's what I thought that

647
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,600
Microscope got ambition in a vision from God and God told him everything that was going to happen when he was like

648
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
Pretty sure you said that with him like the last month or two

649
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
You know I'm starting to think psychopathic

650
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
Liars aren't the most reliable people

651
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,352
None of his matches up and none of it makes sense because none of it's actually real

652
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
The truth is this

653
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
Kind of my assessment of of some of this picture

654
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,568
Alex comes from a zealot as right-wing household and his dad is a huge

655
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Society guy in Alex's you

656
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,176
Whatever friends right-wing Christian nationalism he was a

657
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
Supposed to and indoctrinated into

658
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Open question

659
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,832
But he's brought up folks like the holocaust-denying preacher text

660
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
And the British is realist

661
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
Preacher David

662
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
Smith is inspiration for his beliefs of the past

663
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,024
We should give you some kind of a sense of what was going on

664
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,328
Rebelled against that income

665
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
Credibly tight Wildcats

666
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Until it came to a point where he

667
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Couldn't

668
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:52,544
Maybe it was related to his Outburst of violence getting him in trouble like when his dad had to move

669
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
From Dallas

670
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,384
Or maybe it had to do with his out of

671
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
Control impregnation streak but whatever it was

672
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
He came back in line and adopted the extreme right-wing believes that he was raised

673
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:09,440
But the things that you did and engaged in during the time that he was rebelling are things that plagued him with guilt

674
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,768
Or at least that's the presentation he wants people to see on the show

675
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,376
During his youth he got into Satanism so magically all of his enemies worship the devil

676
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,192
During his youth he done protected sex with apparently

677
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,008
Countless women and impregnated many of them leading to them

678
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Pain

679
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
Abortions in

680
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,200
What do you know as an adult abortion is magically the blood sacrament of his Demonic Enemy so weird almost

681
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
Easy to to see through really is

682
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,624
A lot of Alex's ideology can be boiled down to being a racist and having

683
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,208
Completely idiotic politics build on John Birch Society related books

684
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
In the more recent past

685
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,024
Skimming headlines and meme

686
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,096
But a lot of this stuff is there too

687
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,168
Simply transparent

688
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,216
Is more or less him acting out

689
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
He thinks that he was a baby

690
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,568
What he was younger and was having all these abortion

691
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
Political enemies

692
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
And it's pretty

693
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
You know it's a little bit like

694
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
If Alex

695
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
Verbal Kent

696
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
In The Usual Suspects you know

697
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
And that moment where he walks away and he

698
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
Gets rid of his limp and your like oh my God

699
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Keyser Soze

700
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
That's amazing

701
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Right

702
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
He's just a masshole

703
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,656
Who just really enjoyed lying to the cops and he was just reading the thing behind the cops and just going

704
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,240
I'll make up a fun story for you and then walked away and he just went the whole way home

705
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
I also like

706
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,688
Yeah but it's not stuff that he sees on the wall it's like

707
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:42,624
I don't know man I just think that this kind of behavior in demonization that he engages in his destructive

708
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
That goes nowhere good

709
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
I think a better use of his time and resources would be

710
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
YouTube learn

711
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
To make peace

712
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
With some of his past

713
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,656
Sprite and maybe stop insisting that everybody else has to pay for

714
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
Cuz he was the one who

715
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Did the things that I actually don't even

716
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
I mean for the most

717
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
Part don't think or

718
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
Necessarily a problem

719
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
You know I

720
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Think that

721
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
If

722
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,992
In a few was pressuring people into getting abortion

723
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,528
That's pretty f*****-up

724
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,808
B I think

725
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
That just

726
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,880
Getting a bunch of

727
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,184
People pregnant

728
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
Baby

729
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
Irresponsible and maybe a best

730
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Yusuf

731
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
Are people's emotional energy bud

732
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
Whatever I mean it's your life dude

733
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,472
That's how he has long as you're not say

734
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
I don't know

735
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,336
Starting a crusade against Auntie against abortion that culminates

736
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:39,968
In Supreme Court Victory destroying the basic right that we've had for the past 50 years

737
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
I didn't ya do what you do do what you do

738
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
Yeah I think he

739
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,672
I don't know I don't want to over psychoanalyzing but that was a little bit too

740
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Too close to that but

741
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,024
I just see that the way that he has these

742
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
These bulshit thing

743
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:00,704
From his past really feel like they're informing these

744
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,008
Right positions that he has

745
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
In the present

746
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
And he's

747
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
He's not

748
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Some sort of

749
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
Brilliant Mastermind

750
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,408
Shouldn't be too hard to

751
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,432
To see through his

752
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
Poorly-built

753
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
What's mine Ciara

754
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,600
People just don't care to pay attention and he yells funny things sometimes people to

755
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Just kind of think he's

756
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Funny

757
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
Anyway look the timing of this

758
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
Just before the midterms

759
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
Don't tell me we're going to talk about

760
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
The f****** Midtown

761
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:32,704
Ohmygod ohmygod I hate everyone

762
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
And it won't

763
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
Bible prophecies

764
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,480
Shootings at abortion clinic

765
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,320
The blame on us and tried legitimize their culture of death

766
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:54,976
So the prediction of false flags at abortion clinics or Rally's is a very obvious attempt to preemptively justify any active Iowa

767
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,304
What's that are committed by his ideological allies as being fake and

768
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Just the last trying to make themselves look like they do

769
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,424
He's doing this because he knows damn well that far right

770
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,776
Extremists are very likely to attack abortion-related Targets in the wake of this ruling

771
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:13,408
Even without the ruling attacks against abortion providers has been on a giant upswing in recent years

772
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:17,760
The National Abortion Federation just put out their statistics for 2021 and they showed

773
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,576
Big jumps in the numbers of assault and battery cases

774
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,392
I am stalking cases related to abortion providers

775
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,720
And just like clockwork this weekend we saw some violence Direct

776
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
Did that the portion

777
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
Supporters

778
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,888
Jean Lugo a cop running for Rhode Island States assaulted Jen Rourke his democratic

779
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
Make appointment adipro Choice rally

780
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:41,056
And Cedar Rapids Iowa a truck drove through a group of protesters running over one woman's ankle

781
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:47,200
Video circulated of police shooting tear gas at protesters in Arizona fire and canisters into a crowd

782
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
From the windows

783
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
Set the state capitol building

784
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
No need to perpetuate a false

785
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,672
Swag there's already plenty of violence coming from anti-abortion people of the state

786
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,304
Also Alex is saying if his ruling will galvanise the Democrats for the midterms but there's a few problems

787
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
This idea

788
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,936
The first is that it seems to suggest that Alex thinks that the Supreme Court ruling might be a false flag

789
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,264
He said that the timing of the latest mass shootings were suspicious

790
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Just because of the midterms

791
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
But

792
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
He's noting the timing here to which is

793
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Weird so he saying

794
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,224
That the Supreme Court release this ruling in advance of the midterms

795
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
In order to

796
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
2 galvanized

797
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
The Democrat

798
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,904
I mean I don't know what other implication you could bet the only thing

799
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
Right that's why

800
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
The possibility

801
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,400
Alright he's addicted to being a weirdo

802
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:43,520
As I don't think that this necessarily is going to get everyone super jazzed about the Democrats

803
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:50,176
At present there is the only viable alternative to vote for other than the GOP so that lesser of two evils Dynamic is still in

804
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,504
One place but the criticism about the Supreme Court decision that I've seen

805
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,832
Has been directed as much at the Democrats

806
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Republicans

807
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
And I criticism as well Warren

808
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,048
The Democratic party has an ample opportunity to take action that would have made access to abortion more secure and no steps were not

809
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,888
Democratic

810
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
Conservative Supreme Court nominees who were

811
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,752
Clearly lying about their opinions on Raw

812
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,384
People like Nancy Pelosi should get a particular bit of criticism being the leader of the party in the house

813
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
For the message

814
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,504
Inside by her support

815
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Only aunt

816
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,576
Detroit's Democrats in the house

817
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,416
I think I think that a lot of criticism

818
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Fat

819
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
Talk about this

820
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
Before we started recording like

821
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
Yeah haters are going to hate

822
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
Yeah I think a lot of people Justice

823
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Expect that

824
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
This is what the Republic

825
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
Composition

826
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
Most

827
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,824
A lot of the criticism is

828
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,663
You f****** do something to anything make ever

829
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Wasn't

830
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,991
The inevitability that we would reach

831
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
That we told you we would

832
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
It's

833
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,623
I mean I would have I would be stoked

834
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,927
Somebody just come out and said I'm sorry

835
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:10,047
Sure I would've been stoked of Nancy Pelosi said I am sorry we screwed this one up

836
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
I don't expect Nancy Pelosi

837
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Prizer painter or something

838
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,007
People in Congress who may have said that we just don't know

839
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
I think the

840
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
Realistically there is

841
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
Far greater chance

842
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,431
Of people feeling jaded

843
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
And not

844
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
Voting

845
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
That's based on this

846
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
I think it

847
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
Is any effect

848
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,903
What you expect in the midterm based on the results of seeing is

849
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,719
Yeah people getting obviously angrier

850
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Protesting

851
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,583
But not necessarily Translating that

852
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
Into electoral

853
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Support of demek

854
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,679
No the Democrats had

855
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
Decision leaks

856
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
We already knew this was coming

857
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Delete

858
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
We knew it was aided already happen

859
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
Abortion is already been gone

860
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,455
And the Democrats had so much time

861
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,783
To think of a thing to say

862
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
The day it happened

863
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,623
Right and the best they came up with is

864
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
You're going to need to vote and give us more money

865
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
So no they are not going to do well in the midterm

866
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:18,399
It's if they wanted to Galvanize people they could have come out and they really probably could have been babe

867
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
Somebody to come out with a f******

868
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,335
Fire and brimstone as let's march today let's all go we're Congress you join us

869
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,639
We're going to overthrow the capitol

870
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,991
Obviously not that far but something something like that

871
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
Instead they came out with

872
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
I'm going to fart my

873
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Dance

874
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Party pants

875
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
Exactly

876
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
What a message

877
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,999
I think that we've had a few days since this

878
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
Do you know

879
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
And

880
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,119
Maybe that's not enough time to really see

881
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
Some actual good leadership emerge

882
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
How would have hoped it would have a bunch of

883
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,287
I don't know I think

884
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,591
You know I'm not I'm not

885
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,431
Advancing the idea that people

886
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
Shouldn't Vote or you know

887
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,551
Try and avoid

888
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
Beauty School the about voting

889
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
But it's

890
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,463
If I were to look at this from an analytical perspective

891
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
I think

892
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
That

893
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,607
You end up probably having less people vote for Democrats

894
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,655
In the midterms

895
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
Demolish I think I think

896
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
The effect of this is the exact opposite

897
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
What Alex's

898
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Disgusting

899
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
And the

900
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:34,943
You know false flags at abortion clinics and all that s*** is just him covering for his buddies

901
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,551
It's a real bummer couldn't be more simple and less

902
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
You are insane

903
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
But

904
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,391
In 2008

905
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,719
We overwhelmingly voted in the Democrats

906
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
The most popular president of my lifetime

907
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
Was the president

908
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
Who had promised

909
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,887
Codify Roe v Wade into law

910
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,423
He had a supermajority

911
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
He had it all baby

912
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,263
And the moment that he got elected

913
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
They didn't do f*** off

914
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:05,151
Aaron said they f****** bailed-out Banks and all that s*** it's over for the Democrats

915
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:11,039
Happened he had another shot they could have done it earlier they can probably f****** do it right now

916
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
What they want

917
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
So they won't

918
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
It's a mess so they're done

919
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,927
Also is

920
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,231
You know he wants

921
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
People pay a lot for gas

922
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
Turns out

923
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
Who's the president

924
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
With his controllers

925
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,447
Loading up in his notes and is teleprompter to tell you

926
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
And tell me

927
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
Use policies

928
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Causa

929
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,511
In the stores and sells the food and drinks

930
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
Alcohol

931
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
For sales are legal

932
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,935
I think you're so stuck

933
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,567
They're now going with that in the news while he's right

934
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
The gas station

935
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,807
Kris prices when

936
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,903
And why should they announce recharging about 10% more than they should

937
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,719
Actuaries I'm not defending

938
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
Future

939
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,583
In WoW

940
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,887
You

941
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,031
It's so weird that Alex is mad by

942
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,895
Endorsing a holiday from gas taxes

943
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Weirder I was going out of his way to make

944
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,759
Make excuses for gas companies engaging in price gouging

945
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,807
It's so wild it's almost like

946
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,111
You'll be mad at B No Matter What by next

947
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,951
Billy doesn't he'll support the gas company's no matter what they actually do

948
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Because ideas

949
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,559
Give me an 88 might as well be biting

950
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,119
How dare he say that he's going to take

951
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
Percent off of gas prices

952
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,263
Now everybody's mad at all companies for increasing gas prices by 10%

953
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
But I'll tell you what you know

954
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
Because Brayden lowered race

955
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
By 10%

956
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:17,503
Future they're going to have to charge 100,000 more percent you just got there doing what's best for us

957
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,319
Let me know them and not you go f*** yourself

958
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Go fuc yourself

959
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,879
It's really weird

960
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
I'm heavily invested in

961
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,791
Is another way of saying what you just said I honestly don't know if he is but like

962
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,607
Is emotionally decompression

963
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
Estranged

964
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,239
So here again is another dishonest framing of the left

965
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,543
Response to the Supreme Court

966
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,895
AOC running around like a chicken with his head cut off in front of me

967
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,879
Blac Chyna

968
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,183
Abortion ruling here is

969
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
All of it is just dishonest

970
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
Framing

971
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
Call boy

972
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
Honestly

973
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
I mean

974
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Look

975
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
You have

976
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,519
Constant gas to talk about white birth rates

977
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,311
He has Nick Fuentes on his

978
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,639
Is f****** website as his own channel on there

979
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Calm down

980
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Calm down buddy

981
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,783
Sound like an a******

982
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
The giant race

983
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,599
So Alex takes a number of calls

984
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,647
And try to get the temple

985
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
From time

986
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,743
I know that we've heard a lot of people call in and pray

987
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
No trays on this episode

988
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
But this

989
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,607
That mean

990
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,447
Just constant talking about weird ideas about God

991
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:45,823
We as Believers must continue to recognize that God is still in control of this world

992
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
And we believe

993
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,919
That he is in control

994
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
And we need to update

995
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
Abandon the evil

996
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
Pranita abandon

997
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Sickness

998
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Taking over this country

999
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
And get back to

1000
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,927
Because God will change his mind and give us a reprieve

1001
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
We just

1002
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
To recognize who's in

1003
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
These people

1004
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Evil

1005
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Abortion

1006
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
Agundis now freely for

1007
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
40 years

1008
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,031
Mom before I even knew what it was they

1009
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
And it's time

1010
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
Now

1011
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
God to take

1012
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
Slices

1013
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
Stop this overnight

1014
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,671
Directions

1015
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,327
We will begin to be blessed as soon as we begin to make the right decisions in Reverse this

1016
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,655
Your behavior changes God's mind

1017
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,543
I believe the message there was

1018
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,103
We need to remember everything is in God's hands

1019
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
And that there's nothing we can do

1020
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
Alex's message was

1021
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,503
Well you should change your behavior and then got a like

1022
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,575
Honestly that also is what she was saying

1023
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,159
She was saying that everything is in God's hands God's in total control

1024
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,951
But your behavior will do

1025
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
Dictate God changing his mind

1026
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
You're in control of God

1027
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Right

1028
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,607
Yeah

1029
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Everybody's

1030
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,215
Beliefs and religion I'm telling you this right now

1031
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Five stars

1032
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,311
Go home

1033
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:27,455
Seems like on it on the surface as a pretty

1034
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,735
Like

1035
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,527
Decent point I guess

1036
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
Except it's not

1037
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,855
It's okay

1038
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:38,975
Then the stuff you normally hear

1039
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,791
Alex doesn't understand a lick or what he saying

1040
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Alex

1041
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
Thanks a lot

1042
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
Time long time

1043
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Fan

1044
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Whole note

1045
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,983
Endeavor of trying to let

1046
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
Play abortion

1047
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
It's a colossal waste

1048
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
We're never going to agree

1049
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
You know there's always

1050
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Both sides

1051
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735
One way or the other

1052
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
Lost Boys

1053
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
How do we deal with

1054
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,599
In lieu of

1055
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
The whole notion of abortion

1056
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
Day or night

1057
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,975
We need to draw Linus

1058
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Collectively

1059
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Draw line in the

1060
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Civil Right

1061
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Molested

1062
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,519
Outside of that timeline

1063
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,567
Existing laws on the books

1064
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,295
Extrapolated or Quantified for me

1065
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
Here's when I'm getting it

1066
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
The people running the abortion

1067
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,743
Operation or anti-human eugenicist

1068
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
But

1069
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,215
The whole movie humanizing devalue Life

1070
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
Is the entire globalist agenda so I see this as

1071
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,079
A very positive move

1072
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,431
Human should decide to protect children and

1073
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
The week

1074
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:09,343
Good enough and informed enough to not make bad decisions

1075
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,135
And then abortion would be obsolete by

1076
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:18,559
Alex absolutely doesn't understand that this collars at all cuz he's not really that good at processing things

1077
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
Right

1078
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,399
This caller has a proposal that seems like a rational solution

1079
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:27,007
But it's actually just a way to rephrase the exact same problem he saying is a waste of time

1080
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,847
He says we need to decide at what point a fetus has human civilization

1081
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
Anything that's done to it past that point would be subject to already exist

1082
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
Claws like the ones against assault or murder

1083
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:43,647
That sounds good on paper Until you realize that the argument would just shift to trying to litigate exactly what that point is

1084
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,511
In all the nuances and caveat that caller recognizes exist now would still exist

1085
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,303
Right now that point is when it

1086
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
Doubt right if I were to

1087
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,423
Suggest that the point should be at Birth this guy is not going to agree with me

1088
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,823
If Alex says that Concepcion I'm not going to agree with him and we're right back where we started trying to legislate the point at which

1089
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
Abortion should be illegal

1090
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
No it's

1091
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
More of like okay

1092
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
So we've got

1093
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
Say

1094
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
What do you want to go with

1095
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
WhatsApp

1096
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,111
Say about four and a half months

1097
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
You know

1098
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,975
Out of the total number of months

1099
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,559
We'll compromise somewhere in between

1100
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
I say

1101
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,911
19 years of a

1102
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:35,359
I appreciate this Dollar on the one hand because it does seem like he wants to break out of the reactionary mold that Alex lives in

1103
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,175
But I also kind of resent him because his position

1104
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Fourth something

1105
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:42,015
It sounds like it's smarter and more moderate than the

1106
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,551
Standard position

1107
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
It's really not

1108
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
The same

1109
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,671
The problem that he's going to run into

1110
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
Because he's a big dumb

1111
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,487
Is no matter what

1112
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
If you want to say

1113
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,047
Oh we're going past

1114
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
And we're going all Civil Right

1115
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
We're not going to abortion

1116
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
Right-wing assholes going to be like

1117
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,751
If you have sex with a pregnant woman than your molester

1118
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
Sting the fetus

1119
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
And that's going to be illegal

1120
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
Because that's how f****** stupid

1121
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,895
Oldham

1122
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,991
How would you end up defrosting a fetus

1123
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:18,367
You did what you gave your social security number

1124
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:23,743
Disputed can't sign a contract

1125
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:32,959
How about that every set everything if security number and then what if your

1126
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Like a parent

1127
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:37,567
And you start like a Tik Tok channel of your

1128
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
Like fetus in the womb

1129
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,943
Hey demonetized exploitation you can only work that

1130
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,551
Fetus for about 4 hours per day if you go any longer than that you got to get twins

1131
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
The grinding up into in some really complicated territory and some Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen territory

1132
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
It's just funny that Alex

1133
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:01,375
Does not understand at all with this guy's say Alex is trying to put together what

1134
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,447
Person is saying to them only really come up

1135
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
Quit talking point

1136
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
And that

1137
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,031
Is even a problem when

1138
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:13,663
Explain

1139
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,199
He's just points that he has already

1140
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
With you Alex

1141
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
Pro-Line

1142
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
And you know there's always

1143
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Expose

1144
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:40,799
Sexualize our children

1145
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
They won

1146
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,407
Right that's why I'm saying Fraulein in the stand wasn't that

1147
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,687
Third trimester

1148
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,295
Say okay this baby now

1149
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,439
The doctor or anybody molest or kills or does anything to that baby

1150
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,231
Existing laws if we have on the boat

1151
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,327
You're saying you're saying

1152
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:08,703
That it needed declare third trimester in human declared has human right to that point

1153
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
What

1154
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,943
What's get all the arguments

1155
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,575
National news

1156
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
Hypocrite

1157
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,815
You didn't go to prison for 10 years

1158
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Go to prison

1159
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
I have murdered my children

1160
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,263
Go to prison

1161
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
I don't

1162
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
Any national news shows have ever talked about Alex getting an abortion or paying for a bunch in his

1163
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,271
Past literally just got it's just it's just

1164
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,575
About us

1165
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,367
We're the only people who bring it up

1166
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,159
Yeah one else is talked about it

1167
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
Nope

1168
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,767
And I don't think that we publicize

1169
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:11,167
Things too much outside of just talking about it on the show when it comes up because I think it's kind of

1170
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,567
Something that I think is important

1171
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,847
I don't care the problem

1172
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,479
Apocracy to it in the bility to learn a lesson

1173
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,295
From the outcomes of his behavior

1174
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:31,391
And recognize that the access to abortion that he had when he was younger

1175
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
Is what

1176
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
Facilitated his life

1177
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,743
To be able to go the way it did

1178
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,559
I know that he like

1179
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,095
To play this game of life

1180
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,679
I wish I could have all 20 of these sweet children

1181
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:50,079
Here in my life and I've I'm deprived of them luxury that he gets to say that now because he did

1182
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:56,479
Didn't have those 20 children

1183
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,551
She had access to reproductive health care that he is now trying to

1184
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
To deprive everyone else up

1185
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,623
And that's the problem not

1186
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391
The fact

1187
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,719
If if whatever punishment they

1188
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,487
Decide

1189
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
Whichever it may be

1190
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Whatever

1191
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,095
Legislature wants it if they said

1192
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,143
Let's make this retroactive as well

1193
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,679
For the past 50 years

1194
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,495
Do you think it would still happen or do you think

1195
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
Let's call it

1196
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,871
90% of the Republicans would have been f******

1197
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,943
Equalizing that same goddamn

1198
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,735
Oh my God

1199
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,807
It's old people saying I want the next year's to be

1200
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Worse

1201
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,623
I want the Next Generation

1202
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,647
But suck

1203
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,671
And die

1204
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,999
Miserably because I don't get to be rich forever

1205
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,559
Or I want the next Generations to have

1206
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
Asturi win

1207
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Lindsey's

1208
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,655
Battles that were won

1209
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
You know the blood in

1210
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
Sweat

1211
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
Pictures of

1212
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,055
People who came before us

1213
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
Skip

1214
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
Amaya

1215
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Kind of

1216
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
Shity

1217
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,527
This caller also is shity

1218
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,343
Paul in the great state of Michigan are on the air

1219
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
Hey Alex

1220
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Weave

1221
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
We taking the beach

1222
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
This is the Victory and now it's

1223
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,023
It's time to move on through the mainland

1224
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
So you can pick

1225
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
The part anyway

1226
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,143
But it's it's raising awareness

1227
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,935
Raising awareness

1228
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
To agree with me right

1229
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,567
Analogy of Landing in Normandy perfect Starts Now

1230
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:32,223
Yeah it's her like take this and you know other things that have already been set on this show

1231
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,575
This is something that's really important to recognize is a mentality of

1232
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
The people who are

1233
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
You know now

1234
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,671
You should be very worried about

1235
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
Yahoo

1236
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,487
This is viewed as a begin

1237
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,303
This is viewed as a beginner

1238
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,327
And what

1239
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Next

1240
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,143
Is all of the

1241
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,423
Stuff that has

1242
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Maybe both

1243
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,471
Be able

1244
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,359
It's better afforded to all manner of folk in The Help

1245
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
Lgbtq + community

1246
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,455
Women

1247
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Are afforded

1248
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,551
Reproductive Health Care

1249
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,343
Housing rights

1250
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,391
Less than a year

1251
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:15,231
There will be at least two or three states where gay marriage is illegal again

1252
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,327
We're less than a year and I think that you have to even look further than

1253
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
I think

1254
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,911
Discrimination type laws

1255
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
They're going to

1256
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,007
Rollback would be surprised

1257
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,799
If it's civil rights

1258
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Becomes a question

1259
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,359
It's going to be on the docket

1260
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
That's for sure I

1261
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
Just

1262
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,991
Think you should be aware that people

1263
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
Like this

1264
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,343
Exist and are not uncommon

1265
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,135
That

1266
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,207
Rolling back row vs way it is landing on the beach at now

1267
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,743
Yeah

1268
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,815
You even hear the mentality that Alex

1269
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,631
Express earlier

1270
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,911
Gay marriage

1271
01:00:55,167 --> 01:01:01,311
You could give them a little bit and they take exactly sexualized

1272
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:07,199
The whole idea what they're saying is that they're like

1273
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:12,575
We were so nice when we let gay people exist in public and now they want more

1274
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,879
Well I guess we'll just have to teach them a lesson

1275
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
Your rights can be taken away

1276
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,511
So we can update on abortion laws

1277
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
From caller

1278
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,351
In Wisconsin did Thumper

1279
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Tell Alex

1280
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,495
I'm calling from the great state of Wisconsin

1281
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
Listed here

1282
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Pretty that within the last

1283
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has

1284
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
Abortion

1285
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,855
Because of a 18-49 laws

1286
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
That's been on the book

1287
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,183
But it was nullified by Roe v Wade

1288
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
But now that that's been overturned

1289
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
2

1290
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
Being an abortion-free

1291
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,607
God

1292
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:01,471
It doesn't matter though we haven't totally stopped yet we're trying

1293
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:17,343
Clinics in Wisconsin have temporarily called off performing abortions because there's an uncertainty about the legal status

1294
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
At the moment

1295
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,255
Focus their efforts at this point with helping people get appointments out of state

1296
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
Organizing transportation

1297
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
For that one

1298
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
Also the Governor and District

1299
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:33,983
Attorneys of the County's containing Milwaukee and Madison have said that they aren't going to enforce anything

1300
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
Governor Evers

1301
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
Steven said that he wouldn't point

1302
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,103
NEPA is that wood

1303
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,919
He has the governor will be open

1304
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,247
Waving prison sentences for anyone convicted of

1305
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,831
This will likely end up leading to a Long Dong

1306
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
Court battle

1307
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
Smitley lead do the band going away

1308
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,463
There isn't strong political will to enforce

1309
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
173 gears

1310
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,095
Give you some idea of how long ago that was

1311
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
Louis Pasteur was still alive

1312
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,471
Ivan Pavlov the guy with the dogs

1313
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,519
He was born here

1314
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:12,127
There was a proximately 35 years before the invention of the fountain

1315
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
Yeah

1316
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,455
So why they're such cowards

1317
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,735
That's so weird to me

1318
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,295
I don't know why everybody is being so cowardly about

1319
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,111
I mean Planned Parenthood f*** you

1320
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Don't shut down

1321
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
What are they going to do

1322
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
Tell him to come get

1323
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:32,351
Why is everybody letting laws happen like they mean anything anymore honestly the only thing that matters is who's enforcing

1324
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
And when

1325
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,191
Well I would say

1326
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,215
I guess

1327
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,031
Probably what you answer to

1328
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,335
Would be that there's a greater risk

1329
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
Of cause

1330
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
Greater harm

1331
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
If you don't

1332
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
Follow that

1333
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,247
It could be used against you too

1334
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,551
Harm your ability to provide the care

1335
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
That you do provide

1336
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,647
And from illegal stamp

1337
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Sure

1338
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,207
And while I understand that

1339
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:04,607
I'm just guessing that I would also like to say

1340
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:09,471
Win-win-win we're Assuming he's still able to

1341
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
Facilitate

1342
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:14,079
Carol by helping title transfer for out-of-state

1343
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,127
And such

1344
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
I don't

1345
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
Know if it's the

1346
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,479
The biggest eel in the world

1347
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
I don't know

1348
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,807
I just I mean ask

1349
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,343
After you read that opinion

1350
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,879
By Clarence Thomas

1351
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,695
Not good I mean it's very clear that

1352
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,255
Laws in this country the Constitution

1353
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
All me nothing

1354
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,863
It doesn't mean anything anymore

1355
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:42,239
I'm not sure I fully agree with that but I do think that if you read that opinion

1356
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
It is

1357
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,847
Something that would

1358
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
Save the needs to be a point where people put the foot down

1359
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,455
Because they're signaling where

1360
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,503
Possible things go

1361
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
What do next

1362
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
When is now haha

1363
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:03,231
From that standpoint I do kind of get what you're saying about like Planned Parenthood to saying no

1364
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,279
Continue to operate come get us

1365
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,839
Come prosecutor

1366
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,655
Trial we get the whole f****** world they're making us

1367
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,959
I understand from that perspective

1368
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
But then again I don't run

1369
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
A gigantic

1370
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,567
Multi

1371
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,847
Tri-State organization

1372
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,639
They could have some kind of

1373
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,175
Exposure somewhere

1374
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,711
And you know

1375
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,991
There's a net good

1376
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
That is done by Planned Parenthood

1377
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:30,111
And if there is some kind of way that doing that would

1378
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
Hurt their ability to

1379
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,183
Vikare and other places

1380
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,719
I'm saying I don't know

1381
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:41,631
I'm just guessing I totally understand I just I'm just at this

1382
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
Like what happened

1383
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
Needs to be

1384
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
Treated

1385
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,799
With the reality of what they just treated it

1386
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,103
Which is that it is D-Day on Normandy

1387
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,711
And if we act like this is something that we can go through in the court

1388
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,015
That's where the problem is

1389
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
The courts are a problem

1390
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Yeah

1391
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Yeah

1392
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,975
Color from Wisconsin which you're mad Wisconsin

1393
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
No I was just fun

1394
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,583
Flashlight to bad Road

1395
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,911
Do this discolor

1396
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
Man this is out of control

1397
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,239
One more thing

1398
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,031
I just wanted you to know that I do

1399
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,079
Pray for you and

1400
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,151
Make a year and a half ago I was praying because

1401
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:29,503
Now I know occasionally you go on one of these Rants and

1402
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,319
Should I be listening to this

1403
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,647
Amarillo conservative lady I teach Sunday school and

1404
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:38,975
You know it should I be listening to that until I asked

1405
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
Not everybody is a

1406
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,119
50 plaster old Sunday school teacher

1407
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
But I need Warriors

1408
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,775
Nobody

1409
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
Nobody fight

1410
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,359
Lights for the babies

1411
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Nobody fights

1412
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
For my children

1413
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,479
That makes me so sad

1414
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,271
Makes me so sad

1415
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
I just

1416
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
The number of steps that it takes

1417
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
To get to that

1418
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,903
Point

1419
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
I mean

1420
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,023
Listen Whitney it's like the opposite of the Sands Fang

1421
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,863
When there were only one set of footprints is cuz you walked as far away from

1422
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
From Jesus

1423
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
Through s*** at his face

1424
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,471
Run towards Alex Jones

1425
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,519
The thing that surprises me about

1426
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,079
The clip like that in the car like that is hurting

1427
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
Instincts are good

1428
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
At the beginning of it

1429
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,175
There is something

1430
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,455
If you are aching

1431
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,759
Conservative Christian person let's say

1432
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,599
You're listening to the show you should be asking yourself should I be listening to

1433
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,647
The exact shows f***** up

1434
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
He is

1435
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
Angry

1436
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,255
He is

1437
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,791
Blasphemous

1438
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,167
Concern should be there and

1439
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,775
The rationalizing it by praying and thinking the God is telling you that Alex's

1440
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,311
The best Champion for the babies

1441
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
Is

1442
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
This is

1443
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,527
This is the reality of the kind of stuff that's discussed on Infowars

1444
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,295
You

1445
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,087
Teach Sunday school

1446
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,159
At a church where they believe that

1447
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,231
There are interdimensional beings

1448
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:20,607
Invading trying to steal your soul and then possess you and make you go bad

1449
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,447
Then yes you should be listening to that

1450
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Alex's

1451
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,823
Mushrooms with Mike Tyson

1452
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,359
Really protecting the cat

1453
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,639
Yep nobody fights

1454
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,735
Thank thank the Lord for that

1455
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,271
Because there's nothing

1456
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,319
We should thank the Lord for in that is that

1457
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,879
But Alex didn't end up going to Satan

1458
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,695
Cuz it was closed so it was close was it

1459
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,535
I can do that

1460
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,327
I'm not claiming that

1461
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,615
The power of God

1462
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,431
You have the power of six

1463
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,599
Here's the deal

1464
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,927
I had constipation

1465
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:28,447
Quiet you have constipation because of the streak of the devil why either share at the shift

1466
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,519
At the shift until I love this I love this f******

1467
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:35,359
Stupid idea of like I had the power of Satan but I rejected adjusted

1468
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,687
You accepted that you didn't know I had it

1469
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,503
But then I was like now I'm good

1470
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,903
I got too many women pregnant with this time I made a deal with the devil and then I experienced what I wanted ice

1471
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,023
I want to take it back I mean he does realize that you don't get to

1472
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
To take back a deal with the Devil

1473
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,095
Like that's the most in

1474
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:59,679
Part of the ironic punishment

1475
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,959
Also the devil likes

1476
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
Let you test drive a car

1477
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,847
Just like hey man actually now that I see their ironic

1478
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,175
Consequences for this I want out of the deal and the devil was like

1479
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,711
We got a 30-day card

1480
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
Oh no

1481
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,807
I didn't use capital letters

1482
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:22,207
Sovereign citizen typo loophole with the Devil

1483
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:28,607
People who listen to

1484
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:35,263
Recognized is just an expression of a single person's entirely insane inner turmoil.

1485
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Refuses to deal with

1486
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,847
Because he's found a way to make that turmoil profit

1487
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:44,223
Alex acts out his behavior hurts people and it doesn't matter because without that

1488
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Turmoil

1489
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,527
Alex isn't interesting

1490
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,623
He's just another extreme-right dumb dumb everyone can write off and ignore

1491
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,207
Like Joe Rogan isn't having G Edward Griffin on as a guest

1492
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,255
Drily discusses burter s***

1493
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,791
Flagrant 2

1494
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,351
Phyllis Schlafly to come on and get drunk and talk

1495
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
S*** with them

1496
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,703
Buchanan isn't going to be a guest judge on kill Tony

1497
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:08,287
Like this is like Alex's it would be on Dancing With the Stars

1498
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
Yeah

1499
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:14,687
Unfortunately probably

1500
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
This

1501
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,551
Like insanity and nonsense

1502
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
Is

1503
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
What he does

1504
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
He's only

1505
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,951
The only thing that makes him interesting path

1506
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
A cernobil from

1507
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
Anybody else who's just

1508
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,791
Another idiot

1509
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:34,399
F****** dumb dumb reading headlines and then

1510
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,215
It is it is a testament to the

1511
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,495
The power of

1512
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,543
Somebody just shouting all the time

1513
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,871
It should be harder than that and it should

1514
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,151
Seem like there's more

1515
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:45,919
To it

1516
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,991
And I don't know if there is shouting isn't the only thing

1517
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,551
There's also like I think it would

1518
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,367
One of the largest parts of his career has been

1519
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,439
Finding the right gullible people

1520
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:02,815
And insisting that he has secret knowledge he can bestow upon them

1521
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,607
Also

1522
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Is

1523
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,399
Maybe one

1524
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Of his

1525
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,263
His car everybody wants to join a cult

1526
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:15,103
That's the problem how many people just really want to join a cult

1527
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:19,967
Yeah they want that to Arcade esoteric info

1528
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,015

01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:28,415
Going on there's an Allure of the thing that you're not supposed to know that you were being told you can do and

1530
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,767

1531
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,887
Remember what we talked about with Lee Greenwood

1532
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,959
Yeah what happened with him being cancelled at the NRA confer

1533
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:44,031
He hates America

1534
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:56,831
Separate the art from the artist

Choice

1581
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,487

1594
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303

01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:57,055
It's so wore out in the open between the devil and God

1598
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,335

01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:13,183
Between serving good or before Friday

01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,719
I can serve good or I could

1607

So f****** stupid

1611
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:37,759
Anyway this caller goes on to talk about how he's a felon and Alex is not live

1612
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
Listening to him cuz

1613
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,575
Based on the details he's giving

1614
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,367
He might have committed something really f*****

1615
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
The Supreme Court decision is great

1616
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,231
I am a convicted

1617
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023

Non-farm

1619
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,839
Non drug-related crime

1620
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,423
That narrows it down

1621
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,471
My life has no value

1622
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
Founder of

1623
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,431

I'm not committed

1629
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
What's wrong

1630
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Didn't know what I was doing

Constitutional

1636
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,935
You shouldn't

1637
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:34,591
What

1638
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,663
Stop this you got to stop rationalizing for your callers

1639
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:44,063
Explicitly said that his crime wasn't gun-related he pissed off at UPS and it wasn't related

1640
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,367
Anything violent it wasn't guns and it was a

1641
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Drugs

1642
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,159
This leaves

1643
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:53,023
Very few options well I'm going to go ahead and say that there was a bomb

1644
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
Is

1645
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:59,167
Kinda thought I had was you got in trouble with the 80s

1646
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,727
Let me know what you were doing

1647
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
8 it's not drugs

1648
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,031
It's not guns

1649
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
It's not viola

1650
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:09,663
It will it's not alcohol or tobacco Firearms alcohol was involved

1651
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
Trouble

1652
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,759
Yeah it mean if it's a bomb

1653
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:16,575
Yeah or some sort of a racket

1654
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,855
Tearing kind of

1655
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:23,999
Operation like a fish or like he was selling

1656
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:26,303
May be settling down

1657
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,583
Yeah that's a good point

1658
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:34,495
That's the part I could have seen it being like a non-violent crime or sales or something

1659
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:39,615
Firearm-related

1660
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,431
Anyway I don't like Alex

1661
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:48,831
Do you think I chose some freak unlock

1662
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,391
Look it up cuz Tanner is enough of a like

1663
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
Like

1664
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,463
Not super common name

1665
01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:00,351
I figured I could find like Tanner ATF or something I looked around and found a couple people who got arrested for supper

1666
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
Definitely

1667
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
Yeah

1668
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,959
Figure it out and I realized

1669
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
What are you doing

1670
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,311
Probably a bob

1671
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Alex

1672
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,103
There's a lot of

1673
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,383
Legal things going on

1674
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,919
You know we have the Supreme Court

1675
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
We need somebody

1676
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
Common

1677
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
And talk

1678
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,271
Truth

1679
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,575
No no

1680
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
What do you think

1681
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,391
Is it boring snow

1682
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,487
How dare you

1683
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,839
Junior varsity

1684
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,143
Oh no and I was typing soon

1685
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
Forgot about that

1686
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,727
When you're looking

1687
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:42,335
Dislike world-changing news you need to get somebody with gravis

1688
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,615
You need to go

1689
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,175
Get somebody who's like a real heavy-hitter

1690
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,967
Aman about

1691
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,759
Great job

1692
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
Harrison Smith

1693
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,927
Just how out-of-control

1694
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,511
But then

1695
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,095
Editing videos

1696
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:10,239
Today's ruling on Roe v Wade

1697
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:14,336
Yesterday's ruling on the Second Amendment saying New York understates can't bar

1698
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,384
Concealed carry

1699
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
Big deal

1700
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
What is the aftermath what does it really mean

1701
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,904
America this weekend

1702
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,304
Judge Joe Brown

1703
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,888
Judge Joe Brown It's he's actually judge

1704
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:44,288
Yeah yeah yeah I always forget which of them are actually not actually for a long time

1705
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Wait longer

1706
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,848
Yeah

1707
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:53,248
He's also 74 years old boring people I've ever heard

1708
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
No

1709
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Steven

1710
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,392
I'm not endorsing anybody like

1711
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:04,256
Personally I don't know if any of these people a problem or whatever but like

1712
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,048
I used to

1713
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,632
A termites life where I was home

1714
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,656
Allah Allah

1715
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,216
I didn't go to college

1716
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:18,336
Free year I just worked at a movie theater size generally there

1717
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
Or later shift anyway

1718
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
And

1719
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,856
You know the feeling

1720
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,904
Things about these judge

1721
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,976
Alright

1722
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,048
Kind of like the you know standard Opera

1723
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:42,912
Mills Lane unwatchable

1724
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
Is going from Celebrity Deathmatch

1725
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,544
I don't know what's going on never heard you never heard of that one

1726
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,336
1 South is fun

1727
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,616
Animal Court

1728
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
Judge Joe Brown

1729
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,712
Was so boring

1730
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:58,528
Yeah it was not good I'd much prefer Judge Mathis

1731
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,600
41 Hughes in Chicago

1732
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,368
And so like

1733
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,952
Hometown there was a there was a feeling of like I'm in Columbia

1734
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:10,816
I can get on the Megabus and come with me

1735
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,608
He's not one of those New Yorker at late judge

1736
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,168
Now and I think he was a little bit more entertaining

1737
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,448
Cuz I mean you're doing a

1738
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,472
A TV show

1739
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:20,032
Brad was just kind of like well

1740
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,312
If nothing else is on

1741
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Alright I'll watch

1742
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,872
It's very boring

1743
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,640
Yes

1744
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,664
Yes quite

1745
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
He is

1746
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,760
Really really really boring everybody like

1747
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,040
Small claims court

1748
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:36,416
What a weird thing for people to watch on TV it's the precursor to True Crime

1749
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:42,816
Gateway drug

1750
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:46,912
The courtroom let's go further back

1751
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,728
Stepping stone that ruined our brains

1752
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,312
Speak now I want some enterprising True Crime people

1753
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,360
To go back through the seasons of Judge

1754
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,064
Follow up on these people what is their backstories where-are-they-now like do the whole thing cereal

1755
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,624
1 case

1756
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
Absolutely look

1757
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,208
I think that there is a

1758
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,280
Bizarre preoccupation with the lake Court shows and what have

1759
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,352
I wasn't immune to it when I was younger I enjoyed watching

1760
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:22,240
But also we shouldn't talk because everyone loves when you cover a deposition

1761
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:26,592
I read mysterious

1762
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,152
Judge Joe Brown I was

1763
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:36,320
Seriously considering not even talking about him because he was making me fall asleep

1764
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:41,952
But he is such a bigot that we know all about

1765
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:46,560
It doesn't start right away but there will be some mornings

1766
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,424
That he uses some slurs you know I wish it would be more surprising that a judge was a bigot

1767
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,704
Yeah

1768
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,728
Man this guy

1769
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,496
It sucks

1770
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:57,568
So here is the first thing he gets into

1771
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,616
This is where I was like wow this is just born

1772
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,456
Questions but where do you want to go from what I just laid out

1773
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,760
Let's start off

1774
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,296
With New York's reacts

1775
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,112
City mayor's reaction to

1776
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,416
The ruling about

1777
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,952
To snore

1778
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,256
To be armed and

1779
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,304
There's a good thing

1780
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
Blythe

1781
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,120
Arlo this mayor

1782
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,472
Get shop there and not our but the Lawless

1783
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,776
Advocates

1784
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,176
U.s. Supreme Court

1785
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:37,248
I wonder if these Hypocrites on the clown show with

1786
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:41,600
DJ Shakes committee would be interested in that because that's

1787
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,672
What they were accusing

1788
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,440
Mystery

1789
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
Really

1790
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,816
It sounds similar sounds exactly like that

1791
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,864
The j-6 committee is going to do that cuz there's

1792
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,400
Boxing on January 6th

1793
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,424
No no no

1794
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:01,568
Let's see what they should do as they should look at their investigation and instead of doing that one

1795
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:04,640
Take all the things that might be similar to investigations

1796
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,688
And do all of those

1797
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
And then let

1798
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,272
Trump be president forever also extend

1799
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,064
Things that aren't similar at all

1800
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,112
That's a good idea but only for Democrat

1801
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:20,512
Alright we've been doing some of these televised hearings drop everything let's investigate every Democrat

1802
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,560
Craddock governor and throw them in prison now

1803
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:28,960
There's some real lgbtq opposition

1804
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:32,288
Let's say from Joe Brown

1805
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
But there's also

1806
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,384
Some opposition to Good Humor

1807
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,248
Showcase

1808
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,808
Inconsistent

1809
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:46,880
Selfish

1810
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,440
Sean immediate head

1811
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,232
Pleasure without any I'm just

1812
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,000
Standing

1813
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,024
Or respect

1814
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,072
For the other issues that are brought up

1815
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
I mean

1816
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:00,704
Which more revocable in that and then I tell a joke about it

1817
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,264
See you whenever you see your human

1818
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,824
A man or a woman

1819
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,640
No you see a successful

1820
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,432
Somebody

1821
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,736
Somebody is born

1822
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,272
Somebody mature

1823
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,648
Family tree

1824
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,928
And then you get the next

1825
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:24,512
Generation so he spoke want to cut it off because they can't have

1826
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
It's just a

1827
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
Absolutely

1828
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
I

1829
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
I'm flattered

1830
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,168
Well

1831
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192
See

1832
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Okay

1833
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,288
I don't understand what his point was

1834
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,080
His point is that

1835
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
People want to f***

1836
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,896
Too much and they don't have kids

1837
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,432
No the last

1838
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,528
Is endorsing lgbtq Plus

1839
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:52,928
Issues and supporting those communities share because according to Judge Joe Brown this will make it so noisy

1840
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,208
Screw anymore

1841
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,744
And there won't be any people because

1842
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,072
People on the left handle

1843
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,864
People reproducing

1844
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,168
That was basically.

1845
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
Behind

1846
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,472
Oh okay so

1847
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,032
The entire left is trying to destroy

1848
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
Breed it

1849
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
More

1850
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:15,712
Also interesting take on

1851
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,528
The support for providing access

1852
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,808
For puberty blockers

1853
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,672
I don't think that this is a joke

1854
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
Remember

1855
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,000
89 years old

1856
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:32,352
In this state they were talking about having to Bertie block or soda person

1857
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,400
When is never getting to the point where

1858
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:37,984
Buy a pack of cigarettes

1859
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:41,312
Military decide to have their balls cut off

1860
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,128
They've been allowed to take

1861
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,808
Don't want you to know

1862
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,856
Give me the best part of your life right there

1863
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,744
I need to go just all of us

1864
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,048
Every Woman

1865
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,840
Needs to turn to your part

1866
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:07,680
Partner or whomever man within a and radius of you

1867
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,960
And just kill them

1868
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,056
I like sex and I like the carnal pleasures

1869
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
But

1870
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,360
I think it would be

1871
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
Humiliating

1872
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,736
Boners are the best part of life

1873
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:26,624
This is a judge and a

1874
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,904
God-ordained

1875
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,256
Crusader against the globalist discussing their love of boners

1876
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:36,096
Just want to remind everybody that every judge I have ever met

1877
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,400
Or have learned anything about

1878
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,424
Has had

1879
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Such a punk

1880
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,216
Legalmine

1881
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,496
Reinhold

1882
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,288
You know just a well

1883
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,312
I mean he was great

1884
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,992
Yeah I I don't think you're going to get much analysis of law

1885
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,552
Three cheers for boner

1886
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:59,136
Yeah it is fun whenever you remember that judges are just money

1887
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
Everything

1888
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,720
Everything with Power Road

1889
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:09,888
I was looking up how long he did that show I accidentally stumbled onto

1890
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,680
How much he made on that chicken

1891
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,728
Millions of god dammit

1892
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,496
Yeah

1893
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,776
Steve

1894
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,848
Here Comes

1895
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Warning

1896
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:23,968
Coming up trans slur

1897
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,272
Coming up in this next clip here's my

1898
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,344
Conspiracy theory for your Dan I'm I'm a judge

1899
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,648
I have had the power

1900
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
Of life and

1901
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,464
Death over another man

1902
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,512
And what I'm telling you right now

1903
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
Is that the left

1904
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,352
Wants to keep little boys from having boners

1905
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:45,216
That way they won't know that borders of the only reason that men exist

1906
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:50,592
Completely pointless there's nothing else to do with your life it's just boners

1907
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,872
That's the left

1908
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,944
What we want what kind of cases

1909
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,224
Is Judge Joe Brown dead

1910
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992
Before Eve

1911
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,808
Went to pee because they're definitely wasn't

1912
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,368
The cases on Judge Joe Brown show

1913
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,744
It was more like you owe someone $200

1914
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,048
He was but he was probably more like this

1915
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,864
His parking ticket is is a waived

1916
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:16,704
Look again there's a slur coming up

1917
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,984
And also just

1918
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,824
Is really disrespectful attitude towards trans people

1919
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:25,408
There's another thing to it

1920
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,736
Part of this whole thing with the tranny thing is that

1921
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,784
Situation

1922
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,880
The next time the Titanic go down without

1923
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,536
When he goes down

1924
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,888
Don't have that kind of man

1925
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,680
And they want to deal with

1926
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,448
Oh

1927
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,728
I got on a dress

1928
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,520
I should be able to get in there

1929
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,824
Position

1930
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
Smashum

1931
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,896
I'm on the other side of the ship

1932
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,968
The Sharks do to women and children get away safe

1933
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:08,160
Lifeboats are here and there's a bunch of men in dresses trying to

1934
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
The girls

1935
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:09,952
And women

1936
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,024
I mean like

1937
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,048
Quite frankly

1938
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,352
Bigotry aside which is

1939
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,912
Condemnable in disgusting

1940
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,192
That is like

1941
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,496
Bad open mic comedy

1942
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,776
Yeah

1943
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,824
The level of processing and

1944
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,104
And thought that is

1945
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Like I could

1946
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,664
I could see somebody

1947
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
That

1948
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,248
I kind of had maybe later

1949
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:37,856
I recognize them vaguely from other open mics

1950
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,136
Yeah

1951
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,696
Someone who I would not want to be friends with me

1952
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,488
You know you end up accidentally having

1953
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
To see them cuz

1954
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:49,888
You're both at Kohl's or whatever

1955
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,656
Get you

1956
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,960
In trouble

1957
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:57,056
Closest Rowdy enough to fetch it's not going to fly

1958
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:01,664
Some other open mic

1959
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,480
To me like it seems like he's

1960
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,272
Trying to be funny but it's

1961
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,040
Time

1962
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,624
Itza it's a failure and he's also expressing position

1963
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,392
He clearly hold

1964
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,672
Yeah

1965
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,464
I went from having

1966
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,304
0 opinion about Joe Brown she wanted to throw a brick through his f******

1967
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,120
Can window really quickly at The Brick at 8

1968
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:24,448
Very little time and all you had to do was say one thing on

1969
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,776
It was really I've heard a bit

1970
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
In the past

1971
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:33,152
From his show and then also appearing couple times

1972
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:38,272
And it's remarkable yeah I went from I'm so bored by this guy and his

1973
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,064
Dumb bad humor to like

1974
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,392
Holy s*** out guy is hate

1975
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:49,536
No that's a man that cannot live in societies suggesting that trans women

1976
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
Folks

1977
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,352
Who cannot

1978
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,448
Bear giving up their seat on a bus metaphorically or like you

1979
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,984
A space on a life raft

1980
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:03,360
I am so that's what's motivating it and so you should Chum of the sharks

1981
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,688
Behind

1982
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
Disgusting

1983
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,992
No yeah that's meant

1984
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,784
Horrible person

1985
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,344
The statement of a man who cannot live in society

1986
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
But you can't live

1987
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,696
So however that needs to go down

1988
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,744
Well you've got millions of dollars

1989
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:24,096
He doesn't leave with the rest of us anyway with millions of dollars

1990
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,632
So Judge Joe Brown

1991
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
Sports women

1992
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,728
I would argue that he doesn't

1993
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,264
From fiscal

1994
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,848
We have this thing I have a motto

1995
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,384
It's all about

1996
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,920
Protecting Womanhood

1997
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:41,504
And promoting manhood why because the women are resource

1998
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,552
Bear the children

1999
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,696
50 women at the same time so we've always had this thing

2000
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:55,840
When the population goes down the more successful then they get around now we have

2001
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:01,728
The man can procreate they go off we go off to the war

2002
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,032
Doors

2003
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,592
We sacrifice ourselves

2004
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,920
Wives and families and

2005
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:13,760
Life goes on in your jeans

2006
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,064
Because the mother birthed

2007
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
The children

2008
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,648
She could have been pregnant when you lost your life

2009
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,976
Bandits what it is beautiful

2010
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,024
That's nuts I mean he

2011
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,584
Is expressing his support for women

2012
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,912
Based on Timothy resource resource

2013
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,448
Not as people

2014
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:37,056
Yeah well and what he described men as is essentially

2015
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:37,824
Useless

2016
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
Pointless

2017
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,872
And

2018
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:44,736
Should be gotten rid of because once we got cloning baby we don't need anybody to fight the wars

2019
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:48,064
Did anybody have any kids we don't need any man

2020
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,344
To protect nobody

2021
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
Get rid of

2022
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:54,464
What's the Brave New World alfredo

2023
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,000
I mean

2024
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,608
And it is a very antiquated

2025
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
Sort of way to look

2026
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
People I think

2027
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,472
I mean it's borderline he's like well you

2028
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,752
You can see from the way that

2029
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:09,056
Their chimney shape that they're actually very weak

2030
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,104
You know what their brains don't

2031
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
Yeah exactly

2032
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:14,944
888

2033
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:15,712
I think

2034
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:17,504
When you're starting to look at

2035
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,576
All women that is important because they're a resource

2036
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,648
Sure.

2037
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:30,304
Not see the evolution but also I do believe it is but also yeah f*** off

2038
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,864
I mean I think it's

2039
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:36,704
There's a problem here and that is we have

2040
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,520
A guy who's supposed to be a legal expert

2041
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
Keys talking

2042
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,592
A lot of nonsense

2043
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
Tom at the same time

2044
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,456
A lot of the nonsense that he's talking

2045
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,248
Seems to be

2046
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:52,576
Supported in some ways by his

2047
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,368
Extreme bigger

2048
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,160
It seems like that's the

2049
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:59,488
The part that's real things about these laws

2050
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,768
Are not real

2051
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,792
Because they are

2052
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:05,120
Extends even further

2053
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,656
Ordinarily

2054
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:07,680
You can't

2055
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,752
Discriminate against anyone because of race

2056
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,520
Call her

2057
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,568
National origin religion

2058
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,616
AIDS

2059
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,176
Medical condition

2060
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
And

2061
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:25,600
What we have now is a different kind of thing when somebody says I have

2062
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,624
Annex

2063
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,160
I can make

2064
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,744
I can be lying through my tree for the

2065
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,072
Michelle and I can get

2066
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,376
Declared to be a woman

2067
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,704
Troubling

2068
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,264
So I think that's really dumb

2069
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,848
Worry I actually worry about Joe Brown based on the things that he saying

2070
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:50,176
A lot of it just makes no sense in this is kind of a good example of that

2071
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:53,504
As fast as I can tell he's suggesting that there are these categories

2072
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,320
But you're not allowed to discriminate based on

2073
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:59,136
And now they're adding this other one that people can

2074
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,672
Can choose to opt into

2075
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:03,488
I guess so they can get protection from discrimination

2076
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,792
The problem is if they already

2077
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:08,096
Are protected by anti-discrimination laws

2078
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:14,496
Well people traditionally vulnerable don't realize this but they're just as protected by Auntie just

2079
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,032
Termination laws as the group's

2080
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,056
But they are attacking

2081
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,336
Well they don't know it because

2082
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,128
Cuz they're not the ones usually being

2083
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:20,896
Discriminate

2084
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:27,552
For instance the same rules that protect gay men from being discriminated against because they're doing bad would protect I had

2085
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,576
Sexual ban for pigs

2086
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
Discriminated against

2087
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,112
Because there

2088
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,392
Heterosexual

2089
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,416
But that doesn't make sense

2090
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:36,512
That's because heterosexuals are the only people with power and everybody else have died

2091
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:40,096
The same applies in the case of trans related discrimination bills

2092
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:43,936
You couldn't refuse to hire someone because they are trans and you also couldn't

2093
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,728
Refuse to hire someone because they're sick

2094
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,776
Discrimination

2095
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Across-the-board

2096
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:53,920
Joe can be all against this notion of anti-discrimination laws for sexual orientation put

2097
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:58,016
I would imagine he cry bloody murder if he was applying for a job and

2098
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,064
He was told that they only hire gay people

2099
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,136
Discrimination

2100
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:06,720
What is a white as I get to be discriminated against

2101
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,536
I'll never learn this lesson

2102
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
Anyway

2103
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,608
In Switzerland

2104
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,632
You have to own a gun

2105
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:20,032
You do you have to unlock everybody has to offer

2106
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,104
Joe Brown

2107
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,640
Informs us that

2108
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,456
He can kill you with a

2109
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:36,416
Every able-bodied man from 17 to 56 is required to have a military

2110
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,952
Grade 9 m m

2111
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,744
In his possession

2112
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,048
And a machine gun

2113
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,840
A fully automatic

2114
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
A real

2115
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
And two hands

2116
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:51,008
Grenades and Barry since Andre rounds of ammunition

2117
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,080
They don't have any of these

2118
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:57,920
Crazed old running around killing folk off in May

2119
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,712
Not every now and then

2120
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:02,016
Change for a 20

2121
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,368
But I'm wanted two of my get off

2122
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,744
Violent crime is zero

2123
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
It brings it to me now

2124
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,328
74 years old

2125
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,096
But I've been to

2126
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,120
Martial arts

2127
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
Or

2128
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,448
55 years and my shoulder

2129
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:24,288
Open some of my associates

2130
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,824
Probably train very quickly

2131
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:29,408
A lot quicker than we could kill them with a pistol

2132
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,456
Seems to be a trend

2133
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,016
Very

2134
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,552
Capable of violence

2135
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,320
Once people

2136
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,184
Just hypothetical violence that they could inflict on people

2137
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,744
I'll tell you what everyone on Infowars

2138
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,768
Their hands are

2139
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,304
F****** Lethal Weapon right

2140
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,840
I will tell you this.

2141
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,120
Alright

2142
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,144
I haven't

2143
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:50,912
Been in a fight

2144
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:54,752
Since I was 11 years old and I got second place

2145
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,288
In a karate tournament ice

2146
01:39:56,544 --> 01:40:00,128
And I will absolutely beat the ever-living s*** out of Judge Joe Brown

2147
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,664
If he would like to have a fight

2148
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,480
At any point in time to Chicago

2149
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,528
Email me I'll give you my address

2150
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:12,928
Get the f*** out of here I could beat up at the death with my I'm glad that you're saying

2151
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:15,744
Because I know of hubris

2152
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,632
And I don't want there to be video of Judge Joe Brown kicking my ass

2153
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:24,704
It's okay there's there's people

2154
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Martial arts

2155
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:31,872
That are fun like exercise and you do katas and it's very important and it's meditation and then there's like

2156
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,896
People who fight

2157
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
Brighten ethika

2158
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,968
Lili different picture

2159
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:39,808
And if you are a mixed martial artist who trains at fighting alright

2160
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:42,624
You can take any karate master

2161
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,392
Murder that

2162
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
So fast

2163
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,208
It's a different thing

2164
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,816
I don't do any of that and that's how easy it would be to be

2165
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,352
Beat the s*** out of Judge Joe Brown

2166
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,520
I would love for him to take you up on that just all my God I would add that would be great

2167
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:05,920
All that but I think you'll be really funny that it would be futile.

2168
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,224
Take my licks and laughing as hard as everybody else

2169
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,320
Because Joe Brown sucks

2170
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:18,720
This makes clear pee discusses how lgbtq folk existing essentially is the reason that the country is in

2171
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,488
Decline

2172
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,584
We're going over a cliff because we've attempted

2173
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,608
Escalate

2174
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,168
Free in favor of these people who want to

2175
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:29,472
Let children in 15 cups

2176
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,080
Stop lying down

2177
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,432
And the other thing is is this

2178
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,224
This thing about bullying look at

2179
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
Back to the Future

2180
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Dog just bothering

2181
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,416
Standing up for himself

2182
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,952
Bully in his mouth

2183
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,096
Instead of

2184
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,680
Running roughshod over from we've always had this thing

2185
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,984
In Human Society of boys

2186
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,032
Becoming me and had to learn up

2187
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,592
Stand up

2188
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,688
It's cruel that process of that they're really afraid of men

2189
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:13,248
Yeah they don't like it

2190
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,808
55-year campaign

2191
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,832
Emasculate

2192
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:25,024
Bullying goes down exactly like Back to the Future

2193
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,328
Always a movie my man

2194
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,096
Yep

2195
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,144
They just can't understand

2196
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,960
And they have the imagination of

2197
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:33,728
Lava rock

2198
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:38,592
Like the idea that see there's always been this way so it makes sense

2199
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:43,200
You take an older larger kid and you haven't beat the s*** out of a younger kid

2200
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:49,600
And maybe the younger Campbell fight back and learn a lesson or he'll get himself or the other guy will continue to beat the s*** out

2201
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,672
Life

2202
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,208
It's just like the movies

2203
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:02,144
It can't get any better than that it couldn't be a situation I didn't believe him because his dad didn't beat the

2204
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:08,544
Then later on when they grew up they work together at the f****** shop nobody was

2205
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
The boss

2206
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,128
Just down the street

2207
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:17,760
Brown listing off the people who

2208
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,320
Men and hated man

2209
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:26,208
So dumb one of the best Impressions I've ever heard of my life

2210
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:26,976
This guy

2211
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,280
Adomian 10K

2212
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,584
55-year campaign

2213
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,608
Emasculate

2214
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:37,728
I heard just starting back in the mid-sixties when I was with you CLA is an autograph

2215
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:42,080
You had the lesbians who hated man

2216
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,616
D

2217
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,432
Feminist who hated it they work men

2218
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:51,040
The beta boys that hated it they couldn't be real man the gay folks

2219
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,344
Didn't understand being a man

2220
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,696
It ain't you got that anti-war crowd in there to Chad war is a man thing

2221
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,536
Girls show their emotional

2222
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:10,496
And shout and let it all hang out

2223
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:19,712
So you get all of these together and they started to tried to and

2224
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:24,064
The emasculation of the gun

2225
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,136
Impression

2226
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:30,720
I thought for sure that young George Carlin head rich

2227
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,744
Return from the dead

2228
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,280
I thought it was like

2229
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,328
A clip from Cheech and Chong

2230
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
2

2231
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:41,984
I guess according to him it's impossible for gay people to be or gay men to be men

2232
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,544
Guess the thief

2233
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,384
Beecher and Hallmark of masculinity in

2234
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,408
Boners

2235
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,944
Boners he loves boners

2236
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,992
Motors inside of a woman

2237
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:55,040
Is the only thing that man is

2238
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:57,344
Don't let me be frank about something

2239
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:00,928
Judge Joe Brown is on Infowars cuz no one else wants him around

2240
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,232
He's not somebody who is

2241
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:06,048
Like we want legal Scholars

2242
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,608
Come on we want somebody with a real good position

2243
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:12,192
It like boners on the most important thing in the world

2244
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,216
He has

2245
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
Nobody

2246
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,056
Knocking down his door to get his analysis of January

2247
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,848
Or the Supreme Court decision

2248
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,384
So he ends up on Infowars

2249
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,920
Simultaneously

2250
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:25,760
No actual scholar wants to go on Infowars

2251
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:31,392
So you end up with Joe Brown being your expert that you get when there's some kind of illegal thing going on

2252
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,952
Both of these parties are pathetic

2253
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:37,024
Can they meet each other and that's why this conversation is happening

2254
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,328
Cousin no one else wants to be around

2255
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,424
Alex's show is a black hole for credibility

2256
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,960
Judge Joe Brown

2257
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:45,728
Is

2258
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,008
A piece of s***

2259
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,848
Drop slurs in the middle of interviews and no one wants him

2260
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,128
So

2261
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,176
To you you deserve each other

2262
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,200
The show sucks

2263
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
And that's my

2264
01:45:57,248 --> 01:46:01,856
Yeah they had a Rolodex somewhere like we meet up bigot with judge in front of their name

2265
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,392
And reinholds

2266
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,184
You've got moderate views

2267
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:09,280
F****** in the wind I'm trying to sue him

2268
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:14,656
Are just busy gambling on.

2269
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:19,520
Yeah you went on a late-night Bender to the bed on

2270
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:24,896
Supreme Court has made me lost his shirt you would have lost everything

2271
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:31,296
This episode is really interesting to me on the sort of

2272
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:35,392
Pretense of what you would expect it to be versus what it actually is

2273
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:39,488
Frank you know there is the expectation that it's like haha celebration

2274
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,280
1

2275
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:46,912
Obviously it was like this hoorah like f*** you liberal tears and all this stuff

2276
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,192
Kind of think like

2277
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,752
This is the vibe you're going to get out of Infowars

2278
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,288
It's really not

2279
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,568
There's much

2280
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,592
More of a like

2281
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,640
We're now in the war

2282
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,968
Down whatever like we push forward and kind stripped-back

2283
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:02,016
Even Moeller technique

2284
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:02,784
Yep

2285
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
And I think that's troubling

2286
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,136
Because

2287
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,184
Seems to be where a lot of

2288
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,720
The rights head is

2289
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:11,744
And

2290
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,792
Yeah they're not going to be done

2291
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,328
Until it's only straight white

2292
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:17,376
And even then they're not going to be done

2293
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,656
Cuz then it'll be

2294
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,936
Straight white men with

2295
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:24,288
Brown eyes are bad people or the other or however you wanted to go the

2296
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:30,688
The main point of these people who is we should have the power to do whatever we want

2297
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,480
Long-dead

2298
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:35,552
Before it comes down to eye color is probably true

2299
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,832
That's probably true

2300
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,112
But hey

2301
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,672
Will be back Sunday

2302
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,952
Isn't that up

2303
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,864
Think if we do Wednesday episode it'll be not

2304
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:53,984
I think we might need a little bit of a reprieve

2305
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,776
Yeah but

2306
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:02,176
You know like I said the dreamy creamy summer trying to position it in something

2307
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
That is positive so

2308
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:08,832
Help with that please do or I mean Friday

2309
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:11,648

2311
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952

Support this one just because it's

Something good

We have

2318
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,936
