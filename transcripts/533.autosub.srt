1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Damn important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for snowledge b b

00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,952
Dot-com

6
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,536
A little bit about Alex

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Everett

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Jones

00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan

10
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
West Jordan

11
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,544
Mochi

12
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,664
Do you have any other rice-based snacks that you appreciate

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,248
I do I do like cuz I haven't had any in awhile though

14
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
I did I was telling you about this like I've been trying to Branch out and try different types of rice

15
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
I'm kind of excited about that maybe that could be a bright spot right exploration

16
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
Capacitor gone down so far has been disappointing

17
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,448
I tried the Forbidden Rice yes it was not as forbidden as you might imagine.

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
From my kitchen

19
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Exploration for the next

20
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Stay Awhile

21
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,176
Why do people enjoy hearing about whatever like childish

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,504
Cooking Adventure but whatever Rabbit Hole Utah

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,880
Take forever for a few week whatever Elementary level cooking 101 s***

24
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,464
That would be more interesting if the word forbidden was

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
Just more apply to things

26
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Suck

27
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
It's not forbidden cuz it's bad or evil is just bad

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
The black aboveboard and clear

29
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
It doesn't suck

30
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
I'm just not

31
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,360
It's not it doesn't live up to the neck

32
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
That's that the answer is

33
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
I don't actually know how to do it

34
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
The race itself is just

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
Whatever you expect a lot when something is forbidden Segal only the king should have this rice

36
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
Little bit

37
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
The forbidden

38
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Tri-City is it just like f******

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Detroit

40
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Anyway right

41
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
I guess is my bright spot

42
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,592
My Brightside Dan is that approximately

43
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
4 hours ago by partner

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
Never got the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine

45
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
It is great news

46
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
So she'll be transport a transforming into a cyborg

47
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Be dead within 15 minutes

48
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
What happened 3 hours ago and a half hours ago

49
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Oh no that's not good

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
Congratulations

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Everybody is healthy

52
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,432
Yep it's it's nice it's a it's a good little bright spot considering

53
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
You know

54
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
Shittily the teachers union

55
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
Is between you know like

56
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Yep

57
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,208
We have an excellent episode to go over

58
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Too early kid

59
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,888
You're like the guy with an AAS too early and Fast and Furious

60
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Two cars racing and you just went

61
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
Too fast do I write to the barricades so I could slowly go around the

62
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
About you what you I'm always chasing you that's why you understand

63
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
Interesting

64
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Which is a twin

65
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Wednesday

66
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
And

67
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,959
I have some interesting thoughts about it I don't know exactly what was going on but he was able to Broad

68
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
The Studio's a bit dark

69
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
Sure there are lights and there's like focused on him. Like you sitting in a shadow

70
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
The giant million-dollar board behind him pays off

71
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Okay

72
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
It's

73
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
It's bleak

74
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,231
It's interesting this said this episode is really f***** up

75
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
Sometimes when the

76
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
The vibe is this badge in the day off I would have advised

77
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,519
Basically by yourself I would have said you know call in

78
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
Don't do it to keep the flip side of the coin is it like necessity is the mother of an

79
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Jen and Mike

80
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,551
Whenever your backs to the wall sometimes you f*** around and pull out

81
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Something amazing

82
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
We've heard countless stories of that

83
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,975
How many times have you heard a stand-up talk about how like

84
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
It was the worst

85
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,351
Possible scenario

86
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
Sometimes

87
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,311
Cut out a few a whole thing then you comes out that you didn't know was there and

88
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Derisory

89
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
That's not this I didn't think so

90
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
I was not expecting that

91
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
What could be wrong

92
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
To the occasion

93
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
I don't know

94
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
Anyway it's going to be a lot of fun

95
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
12

96
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
Overly white supremacist

97
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,047
Darkroom so you got to brighten it up

98
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,911
Somehow let's take a little moment to say thank you

99
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,495
Boca signed up and Reporting show

The in Mike Tyson's voice was not in parentheses so I'm not doing I'm not doing it

102
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199

Oh.

121
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,647
Steely Dan sounds like a little bit

122
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
I think Meghan has a better voice that I do like the Deacon Blues guitar

123
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Hague

Freakishly large

I didn't say I didn't like Steely Dan I'm just not a silly damn guy

141
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
Like I got into something same thing

00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
I'm not in my I'm not yet 42 so I don't feel like it's the right time for me to get into Steely Dan

143
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879

Ultimate blackpill broadcast today

153
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
That is an

154
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Accurate assessment of

155
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
He's very blackpill mood

156
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,591
Which is probably going to hurt sales of the real redpill she sells

157
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
What's good here is option number 2

158
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687

Liking yourself

165
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,871
I don't know if this is a good Market I think it would be best to avoid that that

166
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
That's great baby you'll be a prank

167
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,087

171
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Alone

172
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Sad

173
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
No cool lights

174
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Behind him

175
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,959
We watch that ass and I don't know

176
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Kind of

177
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
I know he didn't

178
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
But this is responding to a question that we brought it

179
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,271
Hey man you're supposed to be the big pepper guy right it's going on here

186
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Three fingers back at myself

187
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,711
Why the City of Austin was here two years ago in

188
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Wouldn't give us the permits

189
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
For a full power generator system

190
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
That we wanted to put in here

191
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
And you can

192
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
To do that so we're just like the average function

193
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,071
Don't have power but my family doesn't have power

194
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,911
And so I've been going around dealing with frozen pipes and things like that

195
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
I'm not complaining

196
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
What's the red tape

197
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
I would very well may have been dealing with some issues

198
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,919
That's far from the only thing he's been doing well this winter storm is lingard in Texas

199
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
And apparently his family is without power

200
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,575
As it turns out in the middle of all this Alex decided to take a helicopter to Dallas

201
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Sit down and get drunk

202
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
Can smoke cigars with Steven Crowder

203
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
While simultaneously complaining about cancel culture

204
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
And lying about what they do for a living

205
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
I wanted really badly to cover that interview for the show

206
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Very stupid

207
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
It's behind a paywall

208
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
So kind of falls into that territory of things I don't feel right making content out of unfortunately the section they released for free

209
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Free on YouTube

210
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
Kind of dumb it's not it's not worth it and

211
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
You and I were talking about this

212
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
How

213
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Parable of a tease would it be

214
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
That is if we're promoting and then go listen to the last bit of their show I guess

215
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:48,255
We're not doing that s*** there was one interesting colonel in there though that I wanted to talk about

216
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
A lieutenant colonel there was a point where Steven Crowder was trying to help Alex sell his whole like I'm not left-wing

217
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,055
Or right-wing kind of Bona fides

218
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
And Alex said something that I thought was

219
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Shocking and if

220
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
My mom's

221
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Brother

222
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
He was involved

223
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Contra

224
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Text mother family

225
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Humanity

226
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Germany

227
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
8 years old

228
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Stories

229
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
For me

230
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
I've got a group

231
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
The real world

232
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Right and that other people are going

233
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
I grew up hearing about

234
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
So you're always more

235
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
You got lucky you didn't have a

236
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Buffets reading

237
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Right

238
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Sitting

239
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
McGill ever decide call

240
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
You know they just all like

241
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
The Russians

242
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,335
America's going to win nuclear reactors and more weapons in them

243
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
People and I'm a grown up hearing all this

244
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
Go to college for America sucks

245
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
We're good I was

246
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
I'm going to join the Anaconda

247
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
You were going to

248
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
To fight against the

249
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
This is an interesting Insight does not complete idiot interviewing Alex would have heard that realize what can you do

250
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,215
This wasn't him saying but he's neither right-wing or left-wing he's just opposed

251
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Communism

252
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,591
Alex is saying that a young age he decided to join the anti-communist movement

253
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
Any interview were worth a damn would have heard that understood what Alex is saying is that he's not a conservative he's about 1,000 miles to the

254
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
The right of conserve

255
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,135
Anytime you hear him criticize the right-wing like you did with George W bush

256
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
It's because

257
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
They're doing something that seems like something a Democrat would do so they must be a secret communist

258
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Interviews of people at Crowder exist

259
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
Entirely to launder Alex Jones to a naive audio

260
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
Unaware of what actually being discussed

261
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
And getting them to think that he's

262
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Cummaquid

263
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
Atomically Fringe right-wing politics that he has

264
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
Is actually somehow an expression of being above the two party system

265
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:19,295
Crowder's audience skews younger too so this is really an effort to mainstream like a zealot

266
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
Bigot like Alex to Children which

267
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
Steven should be deeply ashamed of

268
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Being a part of

269
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Yeah and also

270
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
F****** couldn't help it

271
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
So I decided I have a few clips

272
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
All right I needed to take a few clip cuz some of this is so embarrassing okay

273
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
All right really bad

274
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
This dumb s***

275
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
It starts at them sort of like Josh and around about Joe Rogan

276
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,407
You two guys

277
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,247
Talk about how's your friends cheat

278
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Completely separate show

279
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Steven Crowder as a baton

280
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
Broken show in like 3 years and I have never met back

281
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,095
Other close friends with the famous guy do I do find it fun when it's just like

282
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
No

283
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Talk about the third person who's

284
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,447
Constantia Lemoore famous route

285
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
Did they start talking about butts

286
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Describing

287
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,039
The Rogan Studio as being like the intestine of a whale or whatever

288
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,111
Talking about the digestive tract

289
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
I need to take a piss

290
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Does a bush right there right now in a whale

291
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Large intestine

292
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Well I don't

293
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
Psychologist sounds

294
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
What what's the largest

295
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Let's move on

296
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
You have the mouth

297
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
You have

298
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Esophagus

299
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
You have

300
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
The object

301
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
What is the small intestine

302
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Oh yeah that's right

303
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
Then you have a small intestine

304
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Largent

305
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
McCullen been erected

306
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
The anus

307
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
No the rectum

308
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Smart the large intestine

309
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
I could do that

310
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
Call Lynn

311
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
Schoolhouse Rock

312
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
I think I missed that one

313
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
Connected to

314
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Large intestine

315
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
Bills

316
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Can you imagine

317
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
We cannot let jump

318
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
That's

319
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Because you've been

320
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Am I go through years

321
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
People here on YouTube

322
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
People were born

323
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Put on YouTube

324
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Defensive at all

325
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
But

326
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
What's that what kind of

327
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Interesting to me is

328
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Back in the day with

329
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Mytalk radio

330
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
Anything's got a logic

331
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Another word you can say that guys are

332
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Or adopt

333
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
You can't say

334
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
My rectum

335
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Anything is considered like

336
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Potty

337
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:00,831
That's just such a great example of crowder and Alex pretending they're like this conversation they're having about that

338
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
The practice going to get them sensor

339
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,255
There's no reliable conservative media system they rely on this pre-emptive complaining

340
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,327
It's something that they haven't even released yet is going to get censored

341
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,423
Would be censored in a certain context nor give them the pretense of credibility

342
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
It's so edgy man it's kind of

343
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Get banned before it exists

344
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
Tattoo

345
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
That's such a great observation that

346
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,711
Patton Oswalt made better 20 years ago and didn't make it about

347
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Cancel culture

348
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
Wheelchair whatever interesting

349
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:35,903
Tonight is next clip here is a it's a one of the three of us needs to be hit with a meteor and I don't care which it is

350
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
After listening to that s***

351
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
One of the three of us

352
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,303
Got to go

353
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,703
Cooper from this that I was really funny where Steven Crowder was talking about how he got into what he's doing because conservative comedians weren't funny

354
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
I'd like to play back that Clubman

355
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Look I see a lot of stupid s*** but I try.

356
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
Short you know I don't go in till like now let's get into the order of how stupid s*** is

357
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
And then trained

358
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,135
Effortlessly or effortfully weave it into cancel culture

359
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,255
F*** yourself by butts on the radio to show any time a kind of

360
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,863
Gross s*** you talking about a f*** if you're going to talk about being

361
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Sensor jerk

362
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,495
Losers so was poorly timed and completely not true

363
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
Free-will Rush when he had the

364
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,431
Magic negro song member that he was facing the LA Times

365
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Yo-yo

366
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Censoring

367
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Wouldn't do that

368
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
So hearing that

369
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:46,559
This is this is the laundering of Alex Jones is Persona on

370
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,959
Platform his racial humor may actually have been what finally did

371
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Russian

372
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
There's actually no way to know for sure but 13 Lieutenant Colonels have actually told me that that is what happened

373
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,271
Like you said doesn't like that him right he's got to stop doing Fentanyl

374
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,927
This next clip is Alex carrying on his great tradition of outing his secret sources that he claims he never out

375
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
Because confidentiality is super important to him

376
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Can't tell you who

377
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,143
And I was Don Jr who's at Saoirse

378
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Please write lawyer

379
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Great American

380
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
It was Trump and Rodger Stone

381
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Nothing

382
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Put out the story

383
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
CIA

384
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
And all that stuff

385
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Crazy

386
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Even though he made up

387
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
That my dad just decided

388
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
What they said

389
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
You can't Ted Cruz love Trump

390
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
And do all that

391
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
When they were the ones that gave me the store

392
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
To be fair you might have

393
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Giving it more legit

394
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
That's not funny

395
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,263
That's not funny that's a tragedy you're just describing a

396
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Tragedy

397
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,383
Hypocritical douchebag

398
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
Friend flash guest

399
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,319
But I'm kind of unclear if Alex is talking about just like

400
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,208
I will cover and pretend anything that's Trump and Rodger say is true

401
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,280
He said therefore I made it news

402
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
Or if it was

403
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Like they had

404
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Some kind of a plan and they were

405
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,448
They were discussing this

406
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Conduit

407
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
To Alex

408
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,800
Here's a story for you

409
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,896
They gave me the story he's literally describing

410
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Them saying we want you to

411
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
You spread this lie

412
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
That's campaign-finance

413
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
BECU

414
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Might want to ask

415
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
So this last Clippers Larry's

416
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Because it really demonstrates a little

417
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,656
Steven Crowder cares at all about accurately presenting the person he's talking

418
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
To to his audience

419
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,288
Your audience is loyal and even with this word

420
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
I know it's probably

421
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Negative what you've talked

422
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Clock to support

423
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Because you have been people have to say to

424
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
It's about you

425
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
You know when don't do it

426
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
What do they disagree with you or

427
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Goddamn

428
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,208
No matter what you think about Alex what do you like him or not the last thing you should say about him is that he's

429
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
You can say

430
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
That's the last word I would use

431
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
To describe this dude who makes up

432
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,704
She had all the time and flip-flops on anything whenever it becomes inconvenient for him work more convenient say something else

433
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
What happened to the globalist

434
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Plan B

435
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,080
What happened to Alex's post DUI Crusade

436
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Clear the names of all the people who've been wrongfully

437
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Convicted of drunk driving

438
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,528
What happened to all of the friends we don't talk to anymore cuz they didn't like Trump enough

439
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:52,160
Maybe my favorite example of this in recent history was have toward the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic

440
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,768
Alex Miss read a headline about the then fairly unknown dr. fauci

441
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,376
Hames Alex decided to report this whole thing about you being a brave person inside the government

442
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,704
Blowing the whistle on how the virus was all a sham

443
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
How it's going pretty looked

444
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Send the falchi teammates

445
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,312
Calls about him he was the real deal

446
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224
Within days after you become the villain in the right-wing media and Alex pretended that whole thing about him looking into him and seen that he's a

447
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
The real deal

448
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
Does not consist

449
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
That is work is meaningless

450
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
Internally self

451
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Contradictory at many points

452
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,280
What is branding is that of a guy who's consistent and he's right about the Bedrock stuff

453
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
That's why Steven Crowder is presenting him this way

454
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936
Because he's trying to sell Alex's branding to his audience

455
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
As opposed to dealing with who Alex actually is a person

456
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
And what is show is actually like

457
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Someone like Crowder is

458
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,896
Is actively doing car but this kind of s***

459
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:50,528
Like a way less talented Joe Rogan who by definition of his lesser Talent attract an audience that

460
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,112
Gullible or a mature enough to think it poo poo and pee pee jokes

461
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,952
And that all you're doing is creating a false image of who Alex is

462
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
I wouldn't even be all that surprised

463
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,120
If Steven Crowder is so God damn cynical that he didn't even know what Alex's show is like

464
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,680
He just hung out with him a couple times and assumes like

465
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,520
Oh he wouldn't be the kind of guy who yells about the hood devil all the f******

466
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Time

467
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
And talks about

468
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,616
People eating poop on his show

469
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
No

470
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
Yeah it was it was a pencil

471
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,832
I just wanted to cover a couple of those little Clips kind of presentation of him is like

472
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
Some sort of elected official

473
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,208
Completely and utterly bungling

474
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
Health crisis

475
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,560
And then writing a ghost writing a book

476
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
About his leadership

477
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
I didn't cut out this clip but on this February 17th episode Alex reveals that Cuomo spends most of his time

478
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Time chained up in a sex.

479
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Bats

480
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Better than what he does

481
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
I would prefer

482
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,224
Where is that it's come out give me a governor

483
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
Who spends more time in a Sex Dungeon then doing evil s*** like him my problem is

484
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Sporting Heather 36 -

485
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
Slants to it that's

486
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
Recognizes the show a little bit.

487
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
You complain a little bit

488
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
Valerie just can't stop thinking of like

489
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
What is Lori Lightfoot had a big

490
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,384
Scandal wears like she spent 240 million dollars on a Sex Dungeon

491
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,176
Of course you do you don't give it to the

492
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
F****** cops

493
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,808
Alex

494
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,160
The broadcasters just doing a little bitching

495
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Because

496
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Z

497
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
Information is so heavy the information

498
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
I forgot it so insanely intense

499
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm going to be covering here today

500
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,776
Broadcast you from a building with 9% except for the studio

501
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,872
We got three generators running just to keep this going 24 hours a day

502
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,992
Bring you this information this is the end

503
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Publix

504
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,576
The end of the country the end of the world as you know it

505
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,928
This is the global extermination plan

506
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,048
Power there 24 hours a day or not at the studio

507
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,352
Save some of your money

508
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
Maybe

509
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,520
Use those generators to help out all those people you know you can use generators to help other

510
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Rife

511
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,616
I don't know it's a little bit confusing

512
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
Becomes more and more confusing as the show goes along like

513
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,016
How much power do you have what is going on

514
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Yeah okay

515
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,880
He's talking about you know Q or not

516
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
Right remember qanon

517
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,328
There is a thing in qanon where they were talking about like the power's going to go out and that's 12

518
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,936
And the hit teams are going to round up the backyard

519
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
No no no no

520
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
No right right the opposite is true

521
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,104
Now there is a black out there power out in Texas

522
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
And now

523
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,688
The right-wing is being rounded

524
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,784
I also noticed everything you said was the enemy bracket was the

525
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
House of Sauron

526
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
And when the

527
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
When the lights go out

528
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,768
SWAT team until around people out

529
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,328
Oh yeah

530
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,472
President

531
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,616
So there you go ladies and gentlemen this is a hellish situation

532
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
I would like it

533
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
Play hit teams

534
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Yeah

535
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
Also howdy

536
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
What what

537
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Happening

538
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,000
You just got into the office on a day with no one has any f****** power

539
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,072
300 text messages I'm being rounded up

540
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,376
Isn't this awesome and it's also a little bit

541
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
A problem

542
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Through his whole life

543
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,312
Everybody is going to have no power here I am broadcasting live on my show

544
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Whatever like

545
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:06,016
I don't know the apocalypse over the great reset is happening obviously I'm still broadcasting and nobody stopping

546
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
If I were him

547
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
I probably would

548
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
Think that it would be better to broadcast from home

549
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
Whatever is Lo-Fi as possible like we're in the bunker We're All in This Together would be a

550
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:24,448
Very nice sentiment seems a little strange too little too late but it would be nice

551
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Through something really severe

552
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,592
To be like well you know my big problem is my warehouses close

553
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,944
Somebody made me cut my vacation short

554
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,248
America Has Fallen

555
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
October Baby

556
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,184
So America Has Fallen

557
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840
America is gone America is dead and only admitted any chance of turning around

558
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:58,240
We are now completely overrun the FBI's completely paid off and he'll honor The Dumping really

559
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,896
I just feel like you'd hear that stuff and if you out if you believed any word of it why would you

560
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:09,504
Follow any laws why why would you feel behold into any form of

561
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
Social contract

562
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,392
And why wouldn't you possibly for one second

563
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
At least

564
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Think to yourself

565
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Okay

566
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:23,328
This is the result of me supporting every politician that I've ever supported

567
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
This is the

568
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Literal

569
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
Inevitable result

570
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
Of everything I've ever believed

571
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
Sure

572
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Yeah

573
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,688
A moment Not For a Moment do you think all this sucks

574
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Done that

575
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,368
Oh no infrastructures crippled I probably shouldn't have supported the party that hates

576
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Yeah so

577
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:53,024
Is Dennis McClure if we get to the the little bit of the beginning of Alex's

578
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,120
Little angry 20in to white supremacy or

579
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,448
He's talking about Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg

580
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
Theo talks about how we're fighting WWII with

581
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
This virus right

582
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,336
And it's true that is true

583
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Okay

584
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
When he says virus

585
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
What he actually means is

586
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
White male

587
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Christian

588
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
Explain something when you come back to the next track

589
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
If this

590
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,304
Everything with them is actually a truthful statement acceptance inverted

591
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,888
We're fighting equivalent of World War II

592
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
10:00 coming up

593
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
Find equivalent of World War II

594
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
The virus is

595
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
World War

596
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
Climate changes is like

597
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,992
What he says were fighting the virus you're the virus

598
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
They called human overpopulation and

599
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Free Speech everything

600
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
And Christians

601
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
White male

602
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
The virus

603
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,768
I'm sorry you song by Bill Gates

604
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Also

605
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
So that's the virus is straight

606
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:06,240
Males Christian males

607
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Straight white males

608
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
Christian being something of a tox

609
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
6 presents

610
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
I don't know if I would describe them as a virus

611
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,504
No I think it's I think that even joking around there is

612
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
Is is a is a little bit iffy

613
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,416
When the evangelico block votes 90% for Trump

614
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
I think we're good

615
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
But that.

616
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
I don't know if you got it really parse out

617
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
Sure you're close to justifying Alex's narrators

618
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,824
I'm partying I didn't say they were a virus

619
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
You can solve toxic presences with things other than

620
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
You know

621
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
His plans

622
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Okay

623
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,880
So remember Enron

624
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,976
Energy company remember address

625
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
Hanalei

626
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
Navigate dude yeah a real real example of late-stage capitalism

627
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
What happened

628
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
I don't know I

629
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,800
Not bad enough things I suppose

630
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
I don't really be able to go on trial I don't know anything about Kendall

631
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Okay

632
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Actually practiced

633
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
He fixes that

634
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
Cuz he came up with the garbage

635
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
You knew that right

636
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
Kim Lai

637
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
Then we already committed suicide

638
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
House arrest of them

639
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
What has he done in Paraguay

640
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
All this works lazy Jones got study

641
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Aldi's boys operate

642
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
How they do it

643
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
The thing I think is really interesting about that is

644
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,712
The juxtaposition of Alex saying

645
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,784
Word is he's down in Paraguay

646
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Cersei as if it

647
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,000
It's facts qanon people are

648
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,792
F****** crazy with this

649
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
Kennedy junior is going to find you and help you in any way

650
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,008
Out there

651
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,568
The word is

652
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
Does he have a lot of Paraguay and blisters

653
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,736
Yeah probably

654
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
Support

655
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Info Warrior

656
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
So Alex

657
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
Is talking about China

658
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
Complaining about

659
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:40,096
I'm going to be honest this is a little bit my ear a little bit racist

660
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,424
Alex is going off on a little bit of a Jag about how

661
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
You know there's

662
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,288
More Chinese men in China than women so they

663
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
Sports

664
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
Man to other places to get

665
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
Brides in other countries

666
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Interests of implying that it's like

667
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:00,576
Exporting people in order to make the world Chinese f***** up and weird

668
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
I'm in the middle of it

669
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,464
Text a situation you go find a wife out east and you bring her back to Oregon

670
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
The middle of this

671
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,328
Kind of disgusting weird Jag Alex

672
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Get some bad news

673
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
A one-child policy to where there's probably

674
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,216
100 million more boys in China

675
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:23,360
Then there are girls so they export Chinese man to colonies and tell them get an African wife

676
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,920
They export American Wife

677
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
They

678
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
Forcibly rape

679
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
The weaker women

680
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
To forcibly make them Chinese instead of

681
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
Which basically is Chinese

682
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
The dark Daily's gentleman

683
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
Play the squip a moment but

684
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
This is all being done on purpose this is rubbing our faces in it

685
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
And we got another bad piece of nose

686
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
He wasn't

687
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Wars

688
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:17,120
What wars but he wasn't American and he was loyal the country he meant well

689
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
Fought the Communists Rush Limbaugh

690
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Dragon radio host dead at 7

691
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,104

00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
Bbbb

693
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688

00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
So Alex is not happy about this news

695
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Disgusting Oma

696
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,344
It's strange

697
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
A little bit

698
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Curious bedfellows

699
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Considering

700
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,816
In the earlier times of his career Rush Limbaugh would have been an enemy

701
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
And somebody who was

702
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Kind of like the

703
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,496

707
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968

Alex pays him quite

714
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
Quite a tribute

715
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,120
This might be

716
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Send.

717
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:28,032

720
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152

721
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456

Going to be hit by nuclear weapons by China

729
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,896

00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,312

739
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
To go through it

740
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
List of who

741
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
They're going to kill right away though they're not funny

742
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,160
If you don't want to stay and fight this I would have a q18 onstage right now

743
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,280
Very good chance that they're going to either blow the entire power grid with an MP's

744
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,352
Short definition for organism the first dry

745
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,424
Ocean's 11

746
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728

Press secretary in all by the people they are scared

749
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,832

752
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,984
Call Diaz Rush

753
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520

I'm just going to throw this out there

758
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
They are shutting off power

759
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
On purpose

760
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
What if

761
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,624
They weren't allowed

762
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
To do that

763
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,464
What if there was some sort of like

764
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
Thing

765
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:02,400
That the law and I'm not saying that we have to give it a name cuz I think names might be a problem for Alex Alex isn't into

766
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,216
The label what if there was like a it like hey

767
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,080
This is a law that says you can't do that despite you being a private companies

768
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:15,712
Suggesting something that would regulate behaviors of company

769
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,784
I feel like I'm playing operation

770
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
Mode

771
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
It's over man America

772
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Cuz f****** done

773
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,256
Rush was the last call I got together

774
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,840
Skip back to where I think this is overtly whites

775
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Supremacist

776
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,448
Be honest with you okay

777
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,544

Death-stars warming the planet

781
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,064
Velocity we don't stop

782
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
Elections for a reason

783
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,720
Veterans are terrorists for no reason

784
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,816
Under the Chinese regime poster going to take all white men in Berea education

785
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,632
And then we every other group after that

786
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,776
Because they know that white men coming from a Scottish Irish English what are we doing their tradition

787
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
And the austro-hungarian empire

788
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
Notary services operations were own

789
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Men

790
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
The mercenary

791
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
British Isles over tribalism

792
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,376
Who went

793
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,984
Really came from folks that you're ugly

794
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Dalton's on Ireland

795
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
All the freedom come from

796
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
Oh boy

797
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:51,200
Okay so I'm going to be real with Alex I don't

798
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
Think he really read anything

799
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,760
That the founders Road

800
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,368
No I don't think so either

801
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,488
And Irish were fighting

802
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,888
For a while and they came over here and democracy happened I don't know what's wrong with you all Freedom flows from the

803
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:15,264
BB the Riverhead of white man that is everybody knows

804
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,104
Freedom originated in England

805
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,504
Whenever they travel to Africa in order to sell human beings America

806
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
Freedom

807
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,416
Sort of mainlining and supporting this Steven Crowder

808
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,816
I hope you're proud you promote somebody who has these kinds of ideas but they disseminate on their show

809
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,912
As we all know Freedom only comes from white men

810
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
Wow coming like

811
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,175
Such an interesting division that I find with his sure like a lot of the time is very much white identities very much like

812
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
Implicit bias and like

813
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,783
No clearly racist positions

814
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
That's why

815
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
Supremacy

816
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,647
Percent Beyond

817
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,975
It's saying that white men are supre

818
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,023
The only

819
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,119
People who have ever thought freedom is worth anything

820
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,191
Only white man ever had that thought

821
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
It's

822
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:23,103
It's a b it's pretty it's like shocking it shocking to see you

823
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
And how things are run

824
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Only white men

825
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
I never considered that.

826
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
Deserve

827
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:35,903
I don't know I guess tributary kind of argument that woodspring off that that River

828
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Is

829
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
That anytime

830
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,559
Anytime to raise actual movement towards freedom

831
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:47,167
It's got to be white people doing it for the only waiting on white people can really be involved

832
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:52,543
Follow whatever the white people that they call white men in order to run

833
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
Operation

834
00:42:54,335 --> 00:43:00,479
Yeah you know how white men often promote Freedom throughout the world so many times

835
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,575
White man go all across the world and just promote the f*** out of freedom

836
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,415
I think that this might be a half thought through thing of Alex's

837
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,743
It might be something that's more emotionally felt

838
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
For him could be

839
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,607
Am I come from the place of white supremacy that is deep within

840
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
His white heart

841
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,191
I would say in his mind

842
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,239
The only freedom is the

843
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:27,103
The freedom of white men to do whatever it is they want and that freedom does only come from WakeMed

844
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
So I will give him that

845
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
You've made an interesting argument

846
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,503
Alex has problems with his staff

847
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,039
Not actually

848
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
He likes the staff

849
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
The look

850
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
This guy his longtime producer

851
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Hey sister

852
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,511

You slowed Minnesota

858
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
Good detail

859
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
His sister

860
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,247
Pledges allegiance to Gigi

861
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Does she

862
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,623
Mainline in Minnesota

863
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
Pledge allegiance

864
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
Gigi pip

865
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
It does sound right

866
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Think I'm joking

867
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
The Washington Post

868
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,703
Roy Donald Trump to save America

869
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Wow

870
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,591
This is what they do in Minnesota

871
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
It's just me

872
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,943
Obviously my producers sister

873
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,087
Pledges Allegiance is you paying because she's an academic and if you want proof read the washing

Which I assume must be about his sister had let I can't even really remember and I

875
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,791
You didn't read the article

876
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
The Washington Post

877
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,191
These listeners who are like in the middle of nowhere and Alex's

878
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Yeah trust me

879
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,543
Academics in Minnesota all pledge allegiance

880
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
2

881
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
Find Jesus man

882
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:09,759
It's it's kind of like whenever you were in elementary school and you'd be like talking to somebody and maybe like

883
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:16,415
Yeah I have a cousin who's in France and they all eat bugs there

884
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,815
What are those things that other 12 to go to France

885
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,911
It's one of those things your dad tells you and then you tell everybody at school and everybody's like

886
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
No

887
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,775
I truly believe anything your dad says yeah

888
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
Speaking of things that I tell you that you shouldn't believe

889
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,175
Alex has a little bit of a Humdinger about his dad

890
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:42,783
Dangerous people

891
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:51,231
CIA definition

892
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
You know there's their types

893
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Short

894
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
Nice friendly little.

895
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Usually

896
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Dark hair

897
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
Play my way

898
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,023
Two of the things they're looking for our physical characteristics

899
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,095
Stiff to be short and have dark hair

900
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
What the f*** are you

901
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:35,007
If you're looking for the Ubermensch they need to be short with dark hair I don't understand

902
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
That's what they're looking to do

903
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Recruit

904
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,431
CIA dentists who are short and have

905
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
Dark hair

906
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,247
It is a pretty CIA Dentistry

907
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:50,111
Cuz he was just coming out of high school

908
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,719
The globalist really watermakers I was short

909
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
That's a little bit

910
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,887
That's a little bit like I yeah yeah

911
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
Stop short guy

912
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Very stupid

913
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Is a very dumb

914
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
So what are they

915
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,055
Through-line

916
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:13,151
Narrative kind of things that Alex is going on about on this episode

917
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:17,503
He's that Biden head of town hall the night prior

918
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,575
Apparently during this town hall he had endorsed

919
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
China's actions

920
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
And also about the weaker

921
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Here's Alex playing necklace

922
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
Here ladies and gentlemen

923
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,839
Is Joe Biden endorsing

924
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,887
Communist China's death camps

925
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
And take over

926
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
Militarily

927
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
Unhhhh

928
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,031
Believable in your face

929
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Treason

930
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,383
Over the top

931
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:49,247
You know about Chinese history

932
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:54,879
It has always been the other time when China has been victimized by the outer world

933
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,695
Is when they haven't been unified at home

934
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,279
Central Pro

935
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,071
The central principle

936
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,447
Is that there must be a United Italy control China

937
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,799
And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that

938
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:17,151
Hi-Point no American president can be sustained as a president

939
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
If he doesn't respect

940
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
Values in the United States

941
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,783
And so the idea I'm not going to speak out again

942
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
What he's doing in

943
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Hong Kong

944
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
What are you doing with the uyghurs in Western

945
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
Mountains of China

946
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,303
Find new Taiwan trying to end the one China policy

947
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
By making a forceful

948
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,679
I said but he said he

949
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,519
Culturally there are different Norms in each country

950
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
And ignore leaders are expected

951
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,335
Directions to follow

952
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:52,223
He said I'm not going to criticize it like he was saying you would criticize it

953
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
Chiquibil lawyer crap

954
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,111
Okay

955
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,951
There are plenty of reasons to critique Biden about his town hall from the other night but this

956
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
Is a complete

957
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
Misrepresentation that will drive Mustang

958
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:11,423
Anderson Cooper asked Biden about his conversation with G came up and

959
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,959
Quote we must speak up

960
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,727
For human rights

961
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
It's Who We Are

962
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:20,127
Alex plays

963
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,919
When you talk to him though about

964
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
Human rights abuses

965
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
Is that just

966
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,551
It is that as far as it goes in terms of the u.s.

967
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,111
Where is there any actual repercussions for China

968
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
Reply

969
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,487
Quote well there will be repercussions for China and he knows that

970
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,559
What I'm doing is making clear that we in fact are going to

971
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:44,447
Continue to reassert our role as spokespeople for human rights at the UN and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude

972
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,543
He's trying very hard to become the world leader and get that moniker

973
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,615
And to be able to do that they have to gain the confidence of other country

974
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,967
And as long as they're engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights

975
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
It's going to be hard for them to

976
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
To do that

977
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:04,415
Wasn't endorsing any of the actions of the Chinese government He was discussing the more nuanced approach to international relations

978
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,951
Then Trump was capable of

979
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
Alex is playing selectively edited clips

980
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,887
The treatment of the weaker people and all this is just not

981
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
True

982
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,495
Even in that clip is him saying

983
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:22,591
I have to respect them and their culture but at the same time

984
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
I'm not going to not

985
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Speak out

986
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:31,295
I am literally saying I'm not going to avoid speaking out just because I have to respect their, and you can

987
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,087
You can take that clip

988
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,111
And get like

989
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,415
You would just enough

990
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,463
Turn off of there too

991
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,511
Spin it into

992
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:45,887
I don't know why he left that second part in there

993
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,983
Of course I'm going to speak out about human rights abuse he is a little bit strange

994
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
I don't know

995
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,335
Edit the clip better

996
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
Eviler

997
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
Yes powers out man that's fair

998
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,991
Do you know everyone loves that Biden is come out and he said the

999
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:06,623
The China can do whatever it wants and it's open season or whatever

1000
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,719
He's not the only North American leader who is recently Ted's

1001
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,583
Who else recently all the prime minister of Canada said

1002
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Women

1003
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,191
That really excited so manly

1004
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
He said

1005
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,567
I like the Thomas Chinese system of total dictatorship

1006
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,151
I like I like

1007
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:36,319
And the women just like squirming and in their seats and just wiggling around

1008
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
Where at

1009
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
Immense

1010
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,207
Woman's gentleman club when he was little bear

1011
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,839
They were just jiggling and snickering and

1012
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,655
Hopping up and down

1013
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,215
It's so sexy have death camps

1014
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Small point

1015
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:59,103
Alex is making up all that stuff about women squirming and being sexually excited by Trudeau's comments

1016
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,895
That's just a product of his own

1017
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,223
Curvy and very weird imagination

1018
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
That clip just makes me want to be like

1019
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,319
Wrong with you

1020
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
F***.

1021
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,719
It's an interesting question of whether he's just making that out because he wants the audience to think that

1022
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Or is that

1023
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
Really his experience of

1024
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,119
Watching a clip like that

1025
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,167
Gross grocery Grocery

1026
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959
Yeah but how much of it is like

1027
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,007
Actual and how much of it is right for me

1028
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
It's for the audio

1029
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
That part I have no idea

1030
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:35,199
Either way it's f***** up that's f***** up anyway also not for nothing that video that he's referencing like

1031
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,503
Recent

1032
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,319
Content of it Shoreline weather

1033
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,719
Context of it and wasn't it like 2 years ago through 2013

1034
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:51,071
What do the prime minister in 2030

1035
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,655
So with a guy like this who's this accurate

1036
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
Straight shooter and consists

1037
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Yes

1038
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
You might be surprised

1039
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
To learn

1040
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,847
I think Alex is having some money troubles okay

1041
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:08,735
Around here goes all Alex don't worry

1042
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
People going to give up

1043
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,375
What is gray matter

1044
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Is it

1045
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Interfaces

Better get right with Jesus

1050
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
Military Tycoon

Veterans

1054

Sure

1055
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:59,423
The average American is a cowardly attack of demonic devil worshiping garbage

1056
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,007
Your neighbors will watch the NFL while your ass is drugged out.

1057

Raping you and you're going to find out now

They're going to rape you and enjoy it

1059
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,463
Do you want to fund this we can stay on there if you knows how long

1060
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
The propur

Willow

Is

1064
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
Holyshit

1065
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,383
If you don't bite

Tide they will rape you

1067
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,807
Your neighbors are watching your neighbors will watches your house is bombed

The other way to stop it is to keep my bulshit on air

1069
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,767
Yeah alright whatever

1070
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:03,167
Cloud

1071
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,215
They're real real human beings who

1072
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
Need to listen to that s***

1073
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
No

1074
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
If I would say

1075
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:12,383
Every single human being on the planet

1076
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
God that's so

1077
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
Do you know if

1078
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
Everybody did

1079
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Come to the show

1080
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
Said no one would know that it's

1081
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,111
Confirmed

1082
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
It's official

1083
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
Hundred percent 100

1084
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Satan is real

1085
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,255
Now explain to you again

1086
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
1

1087
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
Squilliam

1088
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
Athens to high

1089
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,031
When we didn't start standing up for other people and our children are old people

1090
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,871
Protection has been lifted and God is going to let Satan

1091
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,895
Literally

1092
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Annihilate us

1093
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
So I hope

1094
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
Everybody enjoys

1095
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,343
This kind of characterizes quite a bit of the show

1096
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:59,487
Kind of fitting in another galaxy sitting in a dark Studio of course Satan has gotten

1097
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
Control and God's going to let us

1098
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
Destroyed

1099
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,119
50 by the Khalifa It's but it's a little it's a little exhausting

1100
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,679
I dare God to let Satan

1101
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
Kill all of us

1102
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,591
That is that is humorous that you are like cigarettes

1103
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,383
I am fine with it I'll get up

1104
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
Next to that

1105
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,599
Comes before the fall I will not join you in this

1106
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,183
Because it's really a scent Alex's real

1107
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,999
I mean you don't make up numbers like a trillion

1108
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,815
To do I think that's the exact type of number you makeup

1109
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,631
Here's some more stuff it's getting made up

1110
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
Jcu in advance

1111
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,215
Because Alex uses that word you hate

1112
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
Discernment yeah that's the one

1113
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
He has that

1114
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:48,127
If he uses badly I'm going to lose my s*** and he has this discerned

1115
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,431
Right but the other side has something that

1116
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,455
It's kind of like

1117
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:58,879
Crystal balls it sort of works palantir if you will

1118
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
Sickening

1119
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Deferment

1120
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,095
Has a large understanding of the space time continuum

1121
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:12,191
What long-term very accurate predictions that are

1122
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Almost

1123
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
Future

1124
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
Crystal ball

1125
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Real man

1126
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
That's what you got for me

1127
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,247
Crystal Ball but not foreseen

1128
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Basically

1129
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Most of what

1130
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
Has already transpired

1131
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:35,999
I can tell you things are not going good for Satan

1132
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,399
So also now now we're not just

1133
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
Applying Satan

1134
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
As a malevolent Force

1135
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,287
It's designed to torture us and sent by God

1136
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,591
Phil is playing

1137
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,383
Now we've got a Satan

1138
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,919
Who also is like

1139
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
God dammit guys

1140
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,295
I need better help things are going well

1141
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:03,903
Crystal ball

1142
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,207
All the time

1143
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:11,327
What is a good crystal ball

1144
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:15,679
Got to put a part in Middle manager Satan I feel like

1145
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:21,823
Is Alex would just write this as a comedy show like it would kick off

1146
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:28,991
Overworked under supported devil there was a cartoon man your brother

1147
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,343
I would almost guarantee that semi I was watching

1148
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,135
It got super mad about

1149
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:39,487
Programming

1150
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,511
Tunes

1151
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,095
Alex's in-studio is able to broadcast

1152
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,655
Then like I was watching a bit of this as it was

1153
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,215
Aaron Seuss live

1154
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
Yeah

1155
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,543
Cameras look good

1156
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
The lights look good

1157
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,359
The only difference really

1158
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,895
Is that

1159
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Fresno

1160
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Cool

1161
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,991
Backdrop sure

1162
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
But you running it half

1163
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
Alec is capabilities

1164
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
Sounds like well you know

1165
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Bad storm

1166
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Make sense

1167
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:14,815
It turns out that's not why though he's an idiot

1168
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,887
Let me show you some of the history of this

1169
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
Mostly

1170
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,055
Because we have a generator but not wired internet

1171
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
Probably failed

1172
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
Like doing the Quan

1173
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,783
Pride

1174
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:47,839
So you have the generators you just know how to plug a Madman amazing

1175
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,887
Microcosm of conservative

1176
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,703
Leadership

1177
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,471
Well

1178
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
We have the stuff

1179
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,847
Cuz we were told that it's a good idea to have the stuff

1180
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:04,479
But we didn't prepare and we didn't hook it up correctly. No one here knows how to use

1181
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:10,367
And instead of being able and capable

1182
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
Creative

1183
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
I quit

1184
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,999
Yeah cool quite a bit about quitting

1185
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:22,143
He's not giving anything about it

1186
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,191
People say that he's giving up

1187
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
He's not

1188
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
You giving in

1189
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:30,591
Security stole the election why didn't he have to campaign

1190
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
Why do you tell

1191
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
A group of people to Rally

1192
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,807
I don't need you to win

1193
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,343
Telling you

1194
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,487
Because they're trying to demoralize us and destroy our morale facing

1195
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,791
Humiliating us like this will make us give up

1196
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
Really

1197
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,935
I'm not giving up I'm giving out

1198
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
Okay

1199
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,031
Horses from carrying too much you want

1200
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,335
You know how serious this is

1201
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
You want to go off the air

1202
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
You want to just shut it down

1203
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:12,063
Because you people don't get serious and understand what that means I'll never sell off the bubble

1204
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,135
But a certain point ladies and gentlemen

1205
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,695
There's on the serious people around me

1206
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,255
This Crew in here cuz they work with me they're great

1207
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,119
Nobody else I know

1208
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:31,007
Doesn't give a rat's ass and what you just sit there and watch people

1209
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,871
Everyone needs vitamin D3

1210
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,479
Wow

1211
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:45,855
That's that I would I would have I would have preferred if that Springsteen commercial was like

1212
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
Concentra Lamar

1213
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
There's a town

1214
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,719
And if you don't want everyone

1215
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,535
Y'all better come to IHOP

1216
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
Discord

1217
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,607
Goddamn car

1218
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
I wrote

1219
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
Born in the u.s.a.

1220
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,895
Afford a bomb

1221
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:15,807
Text me I can afford this commercial and I can afford the bomb of threatening you

1222
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,207
That also characterizes Alex's show this week

1223
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,743
Yeah

1224
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:30,399
We're all going to die unless you buy s***

1225
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Howard's

1226
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,983
Who don't have the balls to step up

1227
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,823
Do what needs to be done

1228
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:44,223
You coward like the idea that there's not enough serious people around. The only way you could be serious as by Alex's

1229
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Yeah

1230
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,575
That seems like a trap everyone he knows for Nabi

1231
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,415
Big dumb enough to buy spills and so now the show turns

1232
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,695
Takes a little bit of an interest

1233
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
Alex gets hungry

1234
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,583
And so they're sitting in this darkened Studio

1235
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Samantha breakout survival food

1236
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399

Alright pretty great

1244
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:34,143
Good-looking commercial for Thanksgiving dinner of survival food like that

1245
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,679
Near the dark Studio

1246
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:38,239
Fettuccine alfredo is a little too soon

1247
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
Good

1248
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
Yep so now

1249
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,407
Compounded my issues with what is working there and what is not sure

1250
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
Alex takes phone calls

1251
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:53,599
Hard-working

1252
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:59,743
Don't know what is I don't know it's very strange for that s*** you just connect it

1253
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,279
They might have not

1254
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:07,679
Been able to plug in the thing that blocks really scary collars is a prophet

1255
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,471
Sequoia take

1256
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,519
For the people of this country to wake up

1257
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,823
Your nation is judged

1258
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,103
You have been found wanting

1259
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
Information for you Alex

1260
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
That is imperative

1261
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
I can't get into it over line

1262
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
I'm going to tell you right now

1263
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
There are

1264
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
60 million

1265
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Live stats

1266
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
Right now

1267
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,487
All I'm asking for you is fit

1268
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
15 minutes of your time

1269
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,071
If I give you this information

1270
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
And you hear it

1271
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
You'll note the truth

1272
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
And it's going to answer a lot of questions

1273
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
But you have had

1274
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,775
That you have not been able to get answers to

1275
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,055
I'm a man of God

1276
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
I'm a prophet of God

1277
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,455
I'll get your info but I mean here's the deal everybody always used to talk to me privately

1278
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,783
Make it on there but

1279
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:00,415
I think this is judgement I'm not talking to you I'm not giving you 15 minutes

1280
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,207
Excuse me sir I know

1281
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,231
It's

1282
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,071
Yellow bottom profit millions are going to die

1283
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,655
You sound silly with the star of the show

1284
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
You're just

1285
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,703
The guy calling in

1286
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,775
That's that's what kind of like

1287
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,567
Can hit my ear really weird is like

1288
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,871
How is that any different than the stuff Alex

1289
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:24,479
I'm not really I'm always Blown Away by how local everyone is like

1290
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,039
360 million lives are at stake

1291
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:33,439
Globe is interconnected I get that you guys want there to be nationalism and ship but even in that way

1292
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:39,839
World globe is interconnected if 360 million

1293
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
He was saying that it's all

1294
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,655
Just the United States

1295
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
I could be all over the

1296
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
Alright

1297
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,823
GreatCall doesn't go well

1298
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,895
Alex gets another call from a guy and I'm not going to play this cuz it's

1299
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,199
Who cares the color is just he wants

1300
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:59,039
How to plug the Philadelphia Church of God which I look into

1301
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,135
Church of the sound about the teachings of Herbert Armstrong

1302
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,463
Coach Isaiah guy was a noted preacher of British Israel is underwire

1303
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:12,607
A church was started by a guy named Gerald flurry the prophet and the trap was a god-ordained ruler battle happen

1304
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,167
So he calls in to promote that I was watching

1305
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
Temperatures

1306
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
Anyway

1307
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:21,567
Alex gets to this is an interesting thing

1308
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
They came up

1309
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,919
Alex believes in weather weather

1310
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,223
He believes that the globalist

1311
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,015
Can control all this stuff

1312
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,063
I'm so he has this

1313
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,367
Too complicated position he's

1314
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Presenting that is

1315
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,695
Did the Goblins do this

1316
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,719
No

1317
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,511
What could they have

1318
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
Yes

1319
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
Is it wrong

1320
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,839
Song for me to ask questions

1321
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
No

1322
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
So

1323
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,471
It's alright

1324
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
It's strange

1325
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,799
And then wouldn't you know it

1326
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,359
He has all the evidence

1327
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Prove

1328
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
Did they can do all day

1329
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,687
Storms

1330
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,967
Everything

1331
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
Scarce

1332
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,783
Can't find it

1333
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,183
Bad luck bad luck for us it was 20 years ago or sub I got contact

1334
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:15,583
Air Force director of heart civilian head would like to come on the show

1335
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,983
Call because he heard General

1336
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,319

1337
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391

1338
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,975
The Arctic blast south of they wanted to

01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,959

1341
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,031
That was so big we lost sub

01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:04,735
I couldn't find it and I've never been able to find

1343
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,319
Damnedest thing

1344
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,855
Well not everything

1345
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,647
Something

1346
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,671
Oh boy

1347
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,463
I'll wait for him to produce this

1348
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,743
Yeah anytime now

1349
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,791
Not going to wait

1350
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:22,399
So we know from listening to this episode that the Alfredo

1351
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,959
If Zimmerman hadn't cooked it al dente

1352
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,263
Amazing

1353
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
Alex

1354
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,079
PizzAmore survival

1355
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
Call them this morning

1356
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
Macaroni and cheese

1357
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Speak of the devil

1358
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
Macaroni cheese

1359
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,391
You are not going to eat that.

1360
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,975
10% off they were under special for a long time

1361
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:52,351
We'll get back to this here in a second but this either implies that Alex is just doing this to look Beyond

1362
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
Camera eating

1363
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,399
The food sounds like

1364
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,959
They don't have feeling portion

1365
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,591
I don't know survival.

1366
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:08,991
Not like to make a big deal out of this company's different than the others cuz it's going to 1,000 calories

1367
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,807
That's the other ones are like 1,000 calories

1368
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,391
They had themselves in years in a bunch of cells last year

1369
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,927
This is a huge deal

1370
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,463
When it was coming

1371
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,511
The price of food could not last

1372
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:26,143
This low rate for much longer and now even Major Brands like Kraft Heinz

1373
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,447
ConAgra are announcing plans to start

1374
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,495
Food cost on

1375
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
To you

1376
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,567
America's Nationwide becoming

1377
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,359
Where are the empire

1378
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
Global pandemic

1379
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
For Statewide outages

1380
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
Powergrid

1381
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,063
There has never been a better time to stock up a furball food while you still can

1382
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,367
We are

1383
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Leaving

1384
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,695
Food line

1385
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,975
In Texas

1386
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,791
I talked to

1387
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
About 3 months ago

1388
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,399
And I said please write this up

1389
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,727
I guess this was written hastily so I can't really understand this but

1390
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,031
Gentleman

1391
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
You need to get

1392
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,895
What's going on

1393
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:12,991
How are they supposed to write that up in the dark while they're cooking you food

1394
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
NASA

1395
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,975
What if I could ask a better than O'Reilly's

1396
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:26,559
This is a daily occurrence

1397
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Does not work

1398
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,423
Crumple it up to

1399
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,239
Open Oma's to rush

1400
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,823
Paper crinkling noises Omaha

1401
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,663
Another call from a guy

1402
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:46,527
And unfortunately in the process reveals that he knows literally nothing

1403
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,319
How about the power situation in Texas

1404
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
Sure

1405
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:53,183
First-time caller from Arkansas do you have power outages are

1406
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,231
As well as the country

1407
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:00,607
What does ercot stand stand for in the burkot

1408
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,679
I think the the T stands for

1409
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:08,799
Everybody everybody electric reliability Council

1410
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,847
Everywhere

1411
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
It is defined by not

1412
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:19,295
There's the power Consortium on the left it on the West Coast

1413
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
The East Coast

1414
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
And then

1415
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,367
Texas is ever

1416
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,743
So I would say that whenever you hear somebody say something like that

1417
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,047
Imply that they know nothing

1418
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:36,703
About the issue they don't think about the structure the infrastructure the the way the power is

1419
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
78 at around 1

1420
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
You can strongly in further

1421
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,895
Until whenever like Alex tries to sum up his feelings

1422
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:48,223
About the storm that made the electricity issues like

1423
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:51,295
Just go ahead and toss it out like he did that badly written

1424
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
Copy

1425
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,623
They did this on purpose I have family

1426
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,439
What used to run power plant one on the dead now

1427
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
Intuit

1428
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,023
Calder

1429
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
In Houston

1430
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,631
Told others this is all fake to jack up prices

1431
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
This means nothing

1432
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:12,287
Literally just saying nothing in order to make more interesting stories for his audience to

1433
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,823
I have then

1434
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,127
Hey poorly-managed

1435
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,687
What else is your family done

1436
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:25,087
Everything on contra

1437
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:30,463
Everybody's done I drag everyone on the right data recovery everyone that was like

1438
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,047
Crowd of being part of like I was part of Iran Contra you know a good thing

1439
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,095
Me and Ollie's

1440
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:40,447
He's the f*** around it was a good time

1441
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,287
Yeah I don't know it's all very stupid

1442
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,591
I did I did find

1443
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,151
This a little more interesting than some shows

1444
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,967
Recently

1445
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,015
There is at least one

1446
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,295
Appears to be

1447
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
A shift

1448
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,343
Happening

1449
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,159
And maybe I'm just tricked by the fact of the studio was pitching

1450
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,487
I think there is a little bit of that just like

1451
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,535
This is at least novel

1452
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,327
Yeah

1453
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,655
It's obviously he didn't do no reason

1454
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
To do this

1455
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,983
Description taking the day off

1456
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
Come into the studio and

1457
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:19,359
If you have power it's tickets

1458
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,151
Revival food on air

1459
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,199
I'm trying to get the money coming through

1460
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,503
That was a great time to sell survival

1461
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,855
Know what I want to do

1462
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,951
So it's something he can still deliver where is all the stuff in the warehouse

1463
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
Kidnap my power to the warehouse

1464
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,047
He can't deliver anything for at least a week

1465
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,167
What a f****** a****** using an emergency as a prop

1466
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,215
Opticell shed is maybe one of the worst

1467
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,543
You can do something he does regularly up

1468
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,823
God f*** that

1469
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,895
So also I think just two

1470
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,967
Bring this back into really sharp Focus number one

1471
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,039
Seattle wash that Astro number

1472
01:13:59,295 --> 01:13:59,807
Who

1473
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,599
Alex Jones

1474
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,415
Clearly was demonstrating some explicit whites

1475
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,695
Supremacy

1476
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
Two levels Vicky rarely touches

1477
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:13,119
Like there's some things that are usually but kind of implied sometimes

1478
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
But like that

1479
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,935
Idea that he has

1480
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:20,543
That freedom over human history has only sprung forth from white men

1481
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:26,175
It's pretty clearly indicative of like

1482
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,991
This is behind a lot of your other beliefs

1483
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,551
You try to masquerade as not racist

1484
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,087
The only conclusion you can

1485
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
Can draw is that white men are better than other people

1486
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,463
It's not that pretty clear that's the old

1487
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,255
You can tell him his

1488
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,047
So you take that

1489
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,095
You really have it in

1490
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:44,863
Sharp

1491
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,655
Contrast with

1492
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,495
People like Steven Crowder trying to whitewash his

1493
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:54,591
His presentation is

1494
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,663
Just everybody

1495
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
What is

1496
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Like

1497
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
Disgraceful

1498
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,271
Disgrace

1499
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,343
That's really the thing that I have is like

1500
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,647
I I don't know how good the money is

1501
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
B like

1502
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,463
Just know that this is what you're doing

1503
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,583
You're trying to mainstream and normalize this guy to your infantile audience

1504
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,119
Who think PP joke

1505
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,447
Behind it is a guy who thinks

1506
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,983
The freedom only comes from White

1507
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,775
Right so a white males

1508
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:30,431
I don't think the money's that good thinking the money that good I'll tell you why

1509
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,479
Because I was reading about this Ted Cruz thing

1510
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,039
And in the text messages they point out

1511
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,343
That the room fee per night is

1512
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,135
It's $309 and they were like

1513
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
That's a good room rate

1514
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,463
If you are 10

1515
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Cruise

1516
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:47,839
Spelling out literally the survival of the human race for Corporation

1517
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,935
You not have to worry about what your hotel room costs

1518
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,727
I'm telling you

1519
01:15:53,983 --> 01:16:00,127
It's cheaper just to buy be corrupt people than it should be I don't know I mean you don't stay comfort

1520
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:04,479
Really selling out the human race if you don't keep up on room rate

1521
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
I don't know it's

1522
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,183
It's time for me to take all that stuff is so like

1523
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,535
Shrouded in into the security that I really have no idea

1524
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,327
No matter what the price

1525
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,399
This is what you're doing

1526
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
Stop trying to pretend you're doing something else

1527
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,751
Yep hey Steven Crowder

1528
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
You are spreading whiteness

1529
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
Viet

1530
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:33,151
I think it's I think it out I think it's bad and I think it's even like you can

1531
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,943
To be even more direct with it like

1532
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,783
What you're doing is actively trying to

1533
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,087
Pretend that this white supremacy

1534
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,671
That is celebrated at disseminated by Alex

1535
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,719
Yeah that's not what this is

1536
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,791
And by doing that you're trying to trick your young

1537
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,839
Audience into believing

1538
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,911
Did something that is hate isn't paid

1539
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
I mean

1540
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:00,287
Gross it's him

1541
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
KKK member being like

1542
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,919
See he's not wearing the robe so it's fine problem is really with the state

1543
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,479
He doesn't like

1544
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
The state in

1545
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,295
Encroaching upon White

1546
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
I don't understand why that's a

1547
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,815
Oh I can't burn it on somebody's yard right

1548
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,655
This is quite a bit

1549
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,703
And I also resent that

1550
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,239
I

1551
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:36,895
Can't get myself to discover his episode

1552
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,711
Goddamn ethics

1553
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,735
Stan

1554
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,015
It's like I believe in

1555
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,599
Sarah principles more than 280

1556
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,647
Is believing in reality

1557
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,975
Jordan but until then we have website

1558
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:57,375
We do have a website is knowledge, yes we're also on what it was called Twitter

1559
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:03,775
I hate that knowledge underscore fighting I go to bed Jordan

1560
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,823
Local charity or Bellefontaine area to help out

1561
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,103
People who are still doing God's work

1562
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,503
Seattle Wash that Ass

Holding
