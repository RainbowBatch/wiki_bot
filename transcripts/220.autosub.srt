00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
What was the last time you went

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
In front of

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Crowd of

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528
Twenty thirty thousand White

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,560
When your

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Third grade

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,680
Victor like back in my stand-up days

10
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,800
What I was in front of nearly that large what kind of dancer is no certainly not

11
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
No I haven't done that

12
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
You

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
I think I

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Declared myself a nationalist

15
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,784
That was more in like

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,184
Risk that kind of situation

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,768
Nationalist

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
You've got to be you've got to look at the global perspective

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
The Oceania strategy

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
I stake out North America and I put all the troops on the borders English leave everything in the middle of

21
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,968
Let It Go much like Trump

22
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
A recording this last night

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,112
Cuz recording on Tuesday

24
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
On Monday night is Ralliart

25
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,792
Scrubs

26
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,168
Which is the very least they're added

27
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
Costco senior nationalist is really the worst thing in the

28
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
The other things that surround it

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Picture and

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Just some extent

31
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,880
Pick me up on what's going on

32
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Alexace

33
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
Booty on the other side

34
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Definitely

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
I know that because I know a lot about

36
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,152
October 23rd

37
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
2018 episode

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,784
I apologize do not have a Wacky Wednesday episode

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
But duty calls

40
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
Substitutions in life

41
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,744
Presidents over last night

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
And today is one such

43
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
Occasion

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
And say this is

45
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,960
Is all about hatred of people coming up to the Border

46
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
No

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
Only a little

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:01,760
He does you just do that

49
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
The last time we talked about

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,672
Being a army of Invaders

51
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
Trump rally for reasons unknown

52
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Around

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Terrible idea

54
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Well I don't I guess I was kind of I think I was watching something on YouTube and then I went back to the homepage

55
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
What's going on

56
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,552
I started sort of in the middle of Ted Cruz's at the beginning

57
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
That's the worst

58
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Hughes Crossing

59
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
I noticed something in him that you can

60
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
You can see in comics

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
If you watch enough comedians especially in the lower levels

62
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,704
There's often times there people who are really bad comedians or used to getting a terrible response

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
Front of a good room accidentally

64
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,128
And start doing really well and you can see it in their face or like oh my God this is

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
Oh wow I wish it was always like this had that look and it really

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Fuse me

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
Didn't confuse me but it made me super

68
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Grossed out

69
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Because

70
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,256
I could tell the internal machinations in his head were like

71
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Man I wish I had this many idiots would show up for me

72
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,775
Hillary sucks I never

73
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:33,407
USA trains would break out for no reason

74
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,503
It's the kind of crowd if you're a comic you would look man

75
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,831
Would hate for them to be your friend

76
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,719
Performance Brand of Avonlea EcoBoost

77
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,559
Coffee House

78
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
And

79
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
He know

80
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,615
I realize that I've really only watched while he's in the past I've never really watched

81
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
More than liked for continuous minutes

82
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,503
And it wasn't like not infuriating

83
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
I can't believe

84
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
And I know I know I know I'm not breaking new ground on anything or something

85
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Bugs

86
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,375
Like from the podium

87
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
You just walked away from the breakout or something like that

88
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,895
Podium turn around to do like a shrub

89
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,927
I don't even know what to say to describe it but it made me very terrified

90
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,791
Because he is talking about the the Caravan of refugees

91
00:05:54,303 --> 00:06:00,447
And he's calling them an invading Army and stuff like that of the entirely White

92
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Faces behind him

93
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
Just got the shot is all white

94
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,127
And they're all like build the wall built

95
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,199
And it's really really hard to watch that without

96
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Feeling

97
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Of like

98
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,575
And again I know this is not new territory

99
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
But this is

100
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
Are you f****** hate real

101
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,767
There is nothing else going on here there is no reason for it to exist in terms of like

102
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
The midterms

103
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
I don't think this is helping him

104
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,887
I don't think this helping Ted Cruz

105
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Ted Cruz going to get whatever he's going to get you know people are going to be swayed one way or another they do is going to pick up people who work.

106
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,127
Go to vote or undecided people Ted Cruz's got his old people

107
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
And that is that

108
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
This is all

109
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
Rick

110
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Explain the

111
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
The base

112
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
This is just

113
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Rally them around

114
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
This

115
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
This cruelty

116
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,695
It already exists within them normalizing

117
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,815
Let them express it in some public forum where the rest of the country has to watch

118
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
The rest of the country has to see

119
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
This exists

120
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,703
This whole stadium of people don't want you f******

121
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
Can hear you're a f****** Army invader

122
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
And it was really really

123
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Difficult

124
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
To watch

125
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
He gets into his part where he's like

126
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
You know what you know what a globalist is

127
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,111
You know what a globalist

128
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
That's how he laid into I'm a nationally

129
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,231
He's talking about like you know what a globalist is

130
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Pause

131
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Which is

132
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
A little bit like

133
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Everybody

134
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,447
Then he's like there's people who care about the whole globe

135
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,031
Why they can always old-fashioned to be a nationalist

136
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
Bahama nationalist care about our country

137
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
I just got overwhelmed with a sensitive like this is so what we talked about all the time like we don't cover

138
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
Trump nearly as much as we talk about Alex

139
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
And his information

140
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Spear

141
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
And watching

142
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
Like a lot of anxiety because my over

143
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Overriding prevailing

144
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Feeling was

145
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
I am going

146
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Crazy

147
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,519
Because the world that I've been studying

148
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,079
That people tell me I'm crazy for studying

149
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
He's now so

150
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Publicly normalize

151
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Yeah and everyone

152
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,759
Not everyone but a lot of people covering it or doing it very wrong

153
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
And they're going to end up playing into his trap

154
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,951
In the same way we've seen a bunch of Articles to Twitter

155
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
How about how if you are covering

156
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,143
Trump and you use his language of an army of invading people from the South

157
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Even if you're just

158
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Quoting him

159
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
You are helping

160
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
Wreck in your headline if you say Trump

161
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,663
Army of refugees coming done is aided the normalization

162
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Nevada language

163
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,991
You given an advertisement for an army of ref

164
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
And there's 100

165
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Mixed in with

166
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
This

167
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,415
This world did that Trump is allowing

168
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
Rear its ugly head that are exact same thing

169
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
Irresponsibly covering

170
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
What drove everything home for me

171
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,959
Was in the evening there was an article in the New York Times

172
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Came out

173
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
About how someone left

174
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
The bomb in George soros's mailbox

175
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
And my first thought was

176
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
I can't believe that didn't happen already

177
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
It's if you do and it's not good

178
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
To feel that way

179
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,831
It's not good for me to feel like

180
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Took that long

181
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Crazy

182
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
But then on the other side

183
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
We have to dress

184
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Expect it like

185
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
Al Jones is not the only person who does

186
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
George Soros game

187
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Or anything like that

188
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
There's going back clearly before him

189
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
As we've we've seen in recent episode

190
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
There were

191
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
We're other autocratic leaders around the world who didn't like him before that in the 90s

192
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:59,039
Certainly there has been Eastern European despot who have

193
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,111
I just like Tuesday liberating influence

194
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
He tries to bring

195
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,767
Bill O'Reilly I believe in 2007 went on a little harangue about him

196
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Mention those things are footnote

197
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
To what Alex

198
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
Alex has taken all of those little games and gone pro with it

199
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
He's made a career largely out of

200
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
Demonizing George Soros at least in the last

201
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,455
5 years

202
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
And when when we see

203
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Someone leaving a bomb

204
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
In his mailbox

205
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,975
I mean there is there's no other way to say it like this it's getting way too real in the world

206
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
There's no way

207
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Like Alex is not response

208
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
And II

209
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,679
Meme I mean that I don't mean mister Lee that he's legally

210
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Responsible

211
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
But spiritually

212
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
He's actions

213
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
Have created

214
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,407
Now you can make the argument that Trump is also said some f****** s*** about Soros

215
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
Quickfire with the Tucker Carlson's of the world

216
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Uncertain

217
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
That is absolutely true

218
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Cushing Soros active

219
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
The big bad guy in an extended

220
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
Continuous

221
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Alex Jones was

222
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
The proof-of-concept of that that everyone else has taken

223
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
And run with

224
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
And and made their own

225
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
I don't know how else

226
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Because when you look at it

227
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
What we have

228
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Is

229
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
A president who's running

230
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Whether or not everybody there is white

231
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
Being Tire shot on television is a bunch of white

232
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
People saying really

233
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
Callus bigoted things about people who are different

234
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
You have that basically you have

235
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
A president doing nazi-style rally

236
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,511
For no political reason other than that

237
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
Yeah just for the sake of doing it

238
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,215
Venom gloves in the only way for me to be loved is for me to tell you to hate and that it's okay to

239
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Right

240
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Can you have the other side of it

241
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
Where are you have people like

242
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Creating

243
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Paramilitary street gang

244
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,039
That go around because of political

245
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
You have

246
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
People

247
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Who's this

248
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Bentleyville

249
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,791
Boogeyman

250
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Mailbox

251
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
We are so much

252
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,143
The reason that I couldn't sleep last night and

253
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Rapping like crazy

254
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
What it all adds up to me

255
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Is

256
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,383
I had a realization that we are so much further down the road then I

257
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
I

258
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Maybe a naive

259
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
Colonel in my head no

260
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
I never really thought that we could really go back home again

261
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
Necessarily I'm not saying that to normalcy I'm Falling Away

262
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
The reality of

263
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
Like how much deeper in a hole we are than I thought

264
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
Hit me last night

265
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
And it was

266
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
So unplug

267
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
Blame the right way

268
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:11,551
I mean Alex is already set up. He's already set up the idea that they're going to.

269
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
Absolutely everybody on the left George Soros

270
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Vilify

271
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Tucker Carlson

272
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
This whole thing all of these horrible

273
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Conspiracy theories coming out and they were like

274
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
This is our perfect opportunity

275
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
To finally give us a false flag that we can really sink our teeth into

276
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
Find that violence

277
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
The best way to solve their problems and their Giant

278
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
Rationalize it is I only did that cuz I'm a liberal

279
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
I realize

280
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,375
I was in the situation where we're coming

281
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
Buntok Project Camelot or some s***

282
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
The world

283
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
What is Alex going to

284
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Stay

285
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,383
His whole show is about Soros on

286
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Many level

287
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
Yeah these days at least

288
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
And for quite a while

289
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
Call Rhodes Jerome

290
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
All f****** roads lead to Soros

291
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
Last night

292
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
Before this episode of his show

293
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Someone left

294
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
A legit bomb

295
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
In his mailbox

296
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
I can't imagine he doesn't

297
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Do something

298
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
Like I can't imagine he doesn't address

299
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
So I knew that I would have to

300
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Do this episode

301
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
And see what

302
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
And I'll tell you what

303
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
Some really bad stuff in this episode

304
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Surprise butt

305
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
I promise you

306
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
No but if we get through it

307
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
There's some really great stuff

308
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
Ventura

309
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
Cuz we need a pressure release valve I'm sorry about that sort of long-winded intro

310
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:08,799
I think I could have delivered it better if I slept more last night put the same time I'm in I'm in a

311
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
I'm struggling

312
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Every

313
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
Free time the news turn the different way

314
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
No I mean

315
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Closer to

316
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,159
There are anger

317
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,487
I'm not going to get there I might get

318
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
To the point where

319
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
I flee

320
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
That might be where we're at

321
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
Anyway like I said we're going over 2018

322
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
From today's show

323
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,127
I dreamed all night about Trump

324
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
We know

325
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,831
He was laying on the edge of the bed

326
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Slowly crawled up

327
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Wiggling

328
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
I knew

329
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,935
I had become and an absolute

330
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,079
Starts with Alex kind of describe

331
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
Boring

332
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:22,527
I think you got drunk at the rally and maybe he's a little bit rough this morning or something like that

333
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,903
So I don't know it was very on engaging it was mostly just about him lying about how large

334
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,279
The crowd was outside at the rally

335
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,143
Former Alex Jones and current Houston police chief art Acevedo

336
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
He's going to record it said there were three thousand

337
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
So

338
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
He also has really funny that he's going with where he's like

339
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
What's the weather today

340
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,367
I'm guessing the trumps people even without like

341
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
He might be too disruptive

342
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Look

343
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
Thank you for your

344
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Sherp

345
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Second

346
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,727
Please don't be you're not allowed anywhere within 10,000 for you to prompt anymore on account of if you talk

347
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,335
The game is up

348
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
I could be some

349
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Right-thinking advisor of trump

350
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Knowing that

351
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,295
Alex probably feels a little bit like a jilted lover on a personal level

352
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
Probably a little mad that I

353
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
His home state and didn't ask him to do a set

354
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,255
So maybe so

355
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
He's always armed

356
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Is Alex

357
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
Is Elsa a little busy but not publicly but I'm

358
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,055
Certain private equity

359
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Here

360
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,223
Counter-protesters they're all mentally ill

361
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Of course course

362
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,367
He explains it to the drop in the stock market was the Chinese

363
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Cuz of course

364
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
About

365
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Viz

366
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
Refugee Caravan

367
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Course he does some of that

368
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,679
Dimensions goal is defeating America

369
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Christian destiny

370
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
Okay well I'm on board with the glove

371
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,895
Which I think is a little bit too much

372
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:30,783
For him to say coyote

373
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
The globalist if your goal is to

374
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,647
The defeat of America's Christian destiny

375
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
I feel like it's too blunt for him

376
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
But

377
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Whatever

378
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Do you want to if you want to go that direction

379
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Then welcome

380
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
Go to Chuck Norris in 2009

381
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:53,055
It's all kind of boring and a mishmash of nonsense

382
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
And then little bit into the show

383
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
This Proclamation

384
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,503
What's going on

385
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Almost campeon are at this point

386
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Good

387
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,007
And then I get so angry

388
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
But I just have trouble even talking to

389
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151
Called overcompensating

390
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
Prepare for the chef

391
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,135
Like the idea that you can't talk about stuff

392
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
Clear indication that all you're doing is stretching for time and it's evident in this episode

393
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
Money because he's

394
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
Plugging ever

395
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:54,495
Every segment

396
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
And of course

397
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Christmas sale is already

398
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
Action of Cortez Reno

399
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,967
He's frustrated

400
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
If you last that long multi-level marketing

401
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
That would be great

402
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
Finally a little bit

403
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
We've already been over 100

404
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
In the mail

405
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
College

406
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
Neymar

407
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Filled out

408
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Spanish

409
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Okay alright

410
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,119
They're sending in their abs

411
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Absentee ballot

412
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
What's my because they're dead they're writing the wrong address on their eyes

413
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
I don't know I don't think this is true

414
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
It's

415
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,175
Interesting it's an interesting narrative because number one

416
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,503
Breezy to substantiate

417
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,367
You know what I'm saying

418
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
You can't just put one out you have to put out at least

419
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Ravenswood have a pattern

420
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Right come from you

421
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,376
Because I do trust

422
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,728
What is interesting about a little bit

423
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
And I don't relate

424
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,872
The 2016 election you can find some stories about people

425
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,456
Hand is so often the case the reality serves to hurt Alex's argument

426
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
We know about these cases

427
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,160
It's because they're routine Jackson Place With Me

428
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,976
To make sure votes are coming in using the

429
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,280
Staples

430
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,352
Yeah that's nice for instance in Alton Illinois

431
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Audrey Cook

432
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
Who is voting in the name of her dead husband

433
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
Because she said she knew how he wanted to vote

434
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,544
So what difference does it make we want to devote

435
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,872
Compelling argument that felt like she knew what was right

436
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Even though it was a felony

437
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,712
So she voted her dead husband's name

438
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
The black woman who got

439
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
What was it like 5 years

440
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
For felony voting

441
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
That was just because she

442
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Woman got

443
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Five years in prison

444
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Ocheyedan

445
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
No

446
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
So I assume that she is healthy

447
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
The same standard

448
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
Also fun fact Audrey Cook wasn't just a normal everyday citizen who may or may not know better

449
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
Better about what they're doing

450
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
She was a Republican election

451
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
In the town of Alta

452
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Yeah

453
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
I mean we have cases like this alright the idea the very f****** idea of Alex

454
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
Tons of people everybody I know everybody mailed ballots filled out in Spanish

455
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Is

456
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
Is absolutely ludicrous

457
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Fight

458
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
He explains why they're doing it

459
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
In this next clip

460
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
How many points are very slowly

461
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
I don't have

462
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
This is one out of ten thousand

463
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,984
When would people get mailed if you get crap like this

464
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
You have to call the news

465
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
You do Columbus office

466
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,152
Voter registration

467
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,880
Voter registration

468
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,464
Maybe Airport

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
Conservative

470
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,400
But you get the leftist

471
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
Do birdies fly in the sky

472
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,080
I think Alex would consider me a deranged leftist and no I wouldn't I wouldn't do that

473
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Also I don't believe this is

474
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,408
I also Joel Gilbert

475
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,248
He's the guy who directed the documentary Dreams of My real father

476
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,600
About an hour

477
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,976
Fill out one of those ballots

478
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
Himself to

479
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
Hold up as fake evidence that this is

480
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
Yeah but generally it starts throwing around a bunch of like headlines about the places

481
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
The town people voting

482
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
People's names

483
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Generally speaking most

484
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
This concerned about dead people having voted

485
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
If you actually read the article or you look

486
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
Look into it a little bit further

487
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
The actual problem is not voter fraud

488
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
But it's almost always

489
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
Clerical errors made by the registrar or the pulling

490
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,840
Almost every single time when they look into it they find

491
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:13,216
There was some sort of a mix-up in the paperwork here or whatever

492
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
Listed as dead when they shouldn't be or people

493
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,432
Things were filed wrong cases of voter fraud miniscule

494
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,808
Number of cases like that

495
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,440
Hey baby getting there are a couple cases that you can find certainly fits Taurus fit into Alex's

496
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
If you look over the span of many years

497
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Any kind of

498
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Endemic

499
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
Systemic thanks

500
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
And I would

501
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
I would say the

502
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
If you think for a second about what Alex's suggest

503
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,968
He knows people received ballots in the names of dead people in Spanish

504
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
Why haven't any of these ballots been produced

505
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,368
This bdz way to substantially improve the story if it were true

506
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
Also wired

507
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Is friendsgiving

508
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:12,096
Wouldn't the people behind the scam that want to jeopardize getting charged with a very serious felony

509
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
Look at this strategy makes no sense and him trying to wash it away with

510
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,592
Conservatives are going to fill that out they know better only demon left us to come do it

511
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
It's a perfect plan

512
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,736
School moral Republicans are going to do it

513
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,600
Skies this is a terrible plan

514
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,208
It looks very least do a little bit of research and don't send one to Alex Jones

515
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,816
Wealthy brand

516
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,888
Everyone who's associated with Alex Jones

517
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,544
And I think he tipped his hand a little bit there by saying that people

518
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
Wasn't written out in Spanish

519
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
My guess I don't know

520
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
Produced any evidence

521
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
It doesn't Trace back to Fortune

522
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
I'm going to say

523
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
Broth

524
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Yeah

525
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
We see Alex

526
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Doing what

527
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,680
He does

528
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
And that is expressing

529
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
He's a victim

530
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
I don't want to have America won big

531
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
Free speech

532
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
Authoritarian kontrolfreek pedophile Berkeley

533
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,528
Really are

534
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
A bunch of demons

535
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,952
You should

536
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
Take the pigs are political solution

537
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
The spiritual solution

538
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
How many really are just dealing

539
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
What a bunch of

540
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
Demon possessed

541
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
Mother and father

542
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
In order to

543
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
Present

544
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
Things that are unpresentable

545
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
In order to normalize thing

546
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
That other

547
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
Arrows

548
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Beam

549
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Abhorrent

550
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,960
Generally speaking you need to prevent it from a place of

551
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Aggrievance

552
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
You need to be presented from a place of

553
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
We are the one

554
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
Who have been so nice all along

555
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
You've taken our kindness for weakness

556
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,576
And you are the crazy one we are just trying to return things to normal from your craziness

557
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,464
These are marginalized people

558
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
We let these juice into Ark

559
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Haha

560
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Well

561
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
And some of our people aren't doing well so clearly it's the juices

562
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,264
And then we tolerated them for so long and then they just

563
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Book and took from us

564
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:06,176
And you know we can't let this happen anymore. We need to remember that we are a nation

565
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Without

566
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Juice

567
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,552
That is why o.j. is in prison once more

568
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,112
Only tea in the morning 7

569
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,184
Yeah it always works whenever you

570
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
It sucks

571
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Everything

572
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Because

573
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Because his his

574
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
Tiger underpinning to all of this s***

575
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Is everything we're doing

576
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,336
Weird sayings

577
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,128
And then we're saying that

578
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,944
The doing is this up there doing

579
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,368
What it is they say even though they're not

580
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Because they're doing it even though they're not that gives us carte blanche to do whatever we want because they're already doing

581
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,072
It's a gordian knot of blame

582
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
That is just so stupid

583
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,544
The function of legitimately is to present the idea

584
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
And not only that

585
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
Demon

586
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
No not even would you break it down

587
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
The people on the other side

588
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,064
Dumb demon-possessed weirdos

589
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
Zombies walking around

590
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,720
The problem that I have here

591
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
Is it we need to really look at what he's talking about

592
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,632
You put up with this like we leave

593
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,960
We've appeased and appeased and appease

594
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,056
The things that he's talking about are things like

595
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
Gay people being allowed to

596
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
Things

597
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Things like

598
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Non-discrimination laws we let you do it

599
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,928
Things like women having access to appropriate Healthcare that won't kill them

600
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:59,328
Are tongues and then whatever those are they allowed anymore I don't

601
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Things

602
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Like

603
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,960
Minorities being able to speak up about

604
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
The situation

605
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,688
Beady abuses that they may run into from authority figures things like that

606
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
Why we wrote the Constitution

607
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
From the very beginning

608
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
It's um

609
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,392
It's tough for me to hear this from Alex

610
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,208
Disposition of victimhood when all of the things that

611
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Complains about

612
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
AR

613
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,120
Were they gone would return to victimizing every

614
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
It just

615
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
It's a it's a real bummer

616
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Thanks so much about

617
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Unfortunately

618
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,640
What did Louis

619
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
DK's earlier

620
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Off of

621
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
Where he was just talkin

622
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Think about how

623
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Every year White

624
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
People add a hug

625
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
100 years

626
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Between when

627
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Slavery happened

628
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,560
Slavery is the worst thing that ever happened to Black

629
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Like that

630
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,008
Like that is the world these guys are living in

631
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
Taking our slaves away made us the victim

632
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,760
It's the same thing

633
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,576
Hey I lost a lot of money

634
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,928
He's on 5th

635
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Yourself

636
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
Good place really irresponsible

637
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,608
In his rhetoric in that last clip

638
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
Next

639
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
But I'll tell you this I really am most frustrating

640
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,544
We're all going to have to go through the pain is coming

641
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
When it could have been so easy to avoid all this

642
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,408
But I think my frustration is it clear

643
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,248
The world has cancer it's called the left

644
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
And they're not going to go away without fight

645
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,440
They take our morality of our kindness as weakness

646
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
And

647
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,632
The frustration is crushing them show me one f******

648
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
1

649
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Reporting Act of kindness

650
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Crush

651
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,568
Tri-State weathershield they are trying to sense the broadcaster whatever you do

652
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
I'm sure the One X

653
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,688
I would like one act of kindness

654
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
How many years

655
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,392
Give me one of these marginalized

656
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Give me one at

657
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
What you say to yourself wow

658
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,120
You know for all the terrible things that the right-wing is done at the very least this one time they were kind

659
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
There's got to be something but I got nothing

660
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,176
They're doing everything that he is saying that the left

661
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
Is doing and even then

662
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Even then

663
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,344
With him saying that we're doing all of that stuff and then describing us as monsters

664
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
Who are a Cancer

665
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
Never heard that one before

666
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
I'm not saying that you guys aren't people even though you're doing all of them

667
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
Nazis are still human being

668
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Yeah yeah

669
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
You know that

670
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,824
The people are not their government people are not their leaders

671
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
Unfortunately

672
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Trump is such a

673
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,992
Monstrous Recreation of the

674
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,576
Idiocracy

675
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,672
People are going to flock to him whenever they get the chance

676
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
Look at this was f******

677
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
G.w. running again

678
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
There wouldn't be these stupid f******

679
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,728
There wouldn't be this f******

680
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
Like

681
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Tapping into this

682
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,456
Destroy what you don't understand

683
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Because

684
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,808
Active heart rate

685
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:08,160
Because at the heart of it was a cruel cruel person

686
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
But you didn't relish the

687
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
The cruelty public

688
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Allow

689
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:18,656
Sans I guess because what is it

690
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
No they didn't allow the fans

691
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
To get in on the

692
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
The cruelty and really bathe in it

693
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
And make it their own and

694
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
Feel like yeah this is ours

695
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,432
Feel like George W bush

696
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,528
The s*** out of countries he could start a war on false pretenses

697
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
Supercruise

698
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:41,440
Super cruel even then

699
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,768
The best thing to do for them weird liberator

700
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,584
We're going to win the hearts and minds and all of that

701
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Where can I bring

702
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Freedom to them

703
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,960
And he probably

704
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Where to kill all the

705
00:35:54,496 --> 00:36:00,640
Those people destroy the Muslim world

706
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:07,040
After 9/11 if you was in every Muslim from the country

707
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:12,160
It almost certainly in the Middle East for something like that like indiscriminate

708
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,000
Select the idea of the different

709
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,304
Cruelties that you see between

710
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
Modern

711
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
Republican presidents

712
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
It is it is relevant

713
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,008
Let you know if this is something altogether different

714
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
A bit like

715
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Decant

716
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
Left is a Cancer and must

717
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
Exercise the not going out with

718
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248
The fight and they're soulless husk

719
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,392
And we all know you negotiate with cancer and destroys

720
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,464
Because you're so kind

721
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,792
8 I mean what you see here is

722
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
Some of the most

723
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,864
Dangerous

724
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Rhetoric

725
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,008
This preparation ellinell like there's no reason to stay

726
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568
You want your audience to be in a certain state of

727
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
Yeah you want them to

728
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Tubi

729
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,760
The sort of people who will join the proud boys

730
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
In his

731
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
Tone of voice and all of that stuff

732
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Is that

733
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
This is like him

734
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Well aware that he

735
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
He's not going to

736
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
This is him knowing

737
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,048
My legacy is

738
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,120
Is done what I created is going to die out

739
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
And because that hurts

740
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Me so much

741
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
I want

742
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
People to hurt other

743
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,104
If I am going to go down

744
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,432
Then you you're going to wish that you would never done this

745
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,320
Even a little bit later in this episode Alex

746
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
Express is that like

747
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,696
Kicked me off of Social Media stuff

748
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,768
The whole nine yards

749
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,424
I'm going to make them kick me off the internet of course I mean he's preparing his own martyr.

750
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,568
On the show trying to model himself off Colonel Travis

751
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
Write this.

752
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Precise

753
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,920
Nonsense in order

754
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,528
Texas monthly

755
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,880
With one letter Colonel Travis created his own mythology and create

756
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
Yeah like that is

757
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
What Alex's is doing

758
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
Then a much uglier

759
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Much much ugly

760
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,912
I don't know

761
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
Chips bad

762
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Chick-fil-A

763
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:41,152
He wants to get into a little bit of

764
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Comedy

765
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
What

766
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Not good

767
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
We have different views on it

768
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Well ladies and gentlemen

769
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Wesner's viewers

770
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
Import family

771
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:03,168
Ears

772
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
N-word

773
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,776
I'm President Trump

774
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
N-word

775
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
World exclusive right now

776
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,736
We have the video not just the audio cuz you know they can

777
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Fake audio

778
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
Videos of the heart

779
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
We have the world exclusive

780
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,512
It's it's it's it's where they

781
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Spell it

782
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
That

783
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,448
Give me the video of the Trump use the n-word

784
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
Keep selling your earlier Alex is like

785
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
Take me to contacts when I say that I'm thrilled to Trump's at the Edwards

786
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:53,344
Jesus so desperately like please someone clip this so I can make fun of you

787
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,904
Yeah just someone don't get

788
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,952
Someone missed the contact yet

789
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:05,632
I miss you I miss you too

790
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:09,472
Tell people how you William so they remember man relevance

791
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
It is kind of fun

792
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Whether he knows it or not

793
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
Immediately tired

794
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
The word Nationalist and the n word

795
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,528
Together I think most people don't know

796
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
Kind of figure it out

797
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
They kind of handpan

798
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Yeah

799
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
So

800
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
Trump's rally likely mention it

801
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,256
The beginning of the show

802
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
He's a nationalist

803
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
We should all say National

804
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
Really which is fine

805
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Like I said

806
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,568
In a healthy political climate

807
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
The idea of someone having

808
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,944
Preference towards nationalistic policies

809
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Is not

810
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,576
Most unhealthy thing we call them protection

811
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
Inner balance

812
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
Protectionist policies

813
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
There is no doubt about that

814
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
But

815
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
It's not what

816
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,032
That's not what that's not what this means in the political climate they were in right now

817
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
We are in

818
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
Situation

819
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
Where

820
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
We have

821
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Nationalist

822
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
Uprising

823
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Throughout Europe

824
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Alder parts

825
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
To the world

826
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,064
That are all mysteriously

827
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
Pretty fascist

828
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
And all seem to

829
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,256
Future people that like to hang out with Steve Bannon

830
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
I like to hang out Monday

831
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
People who

832
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Don't

833
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
Have

834
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
The people's best interests

835
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
It does seem that way

836
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:52,128
Alex

837
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
You want to talk about this so we might as well bring it out

838
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
Fascism

839
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Is

840
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,575
Primarily characterized by hyperness

841
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,671
That's one of the primary drivers of

842
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
Fashion

843
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,535
When you look historically at the leaders we've been able to Institute

844
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
Successful fascist

845
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
Installations

846
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
Are you looking

847
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
Used

848
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Rhetoric that

849
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
Mirrored populist ideals

850
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
And stressed nationalism

851
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Insane

852
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
People like Hitler Mussolini

853
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Great

854
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
Examples

855
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
Of this throughout

856
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
Throughout history

857
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,551
Traditional

858
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,695
Everyone your enemies are not them

859
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
And then when you also add in

860
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
Features of

861
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
The great teacher

862
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
The Great

863
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:53,823
Along with a picture versus them there's always sort of

864
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Distrust

865
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Other

866
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,967
You know just the idea of like we are a great nation we should be

867
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Be greater

868
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
There's that

869
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,831
And then there he's all others are weird

870
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
And don't trust them

871
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
So when we see

872
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
Trump coming out at this rally and being like

873
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
I'm a nationalist

874
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,279
Nationals

875
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
Yeah and at the same time we have

876
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
All the other invitations

877
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,239
We see him calling these the refugees

878
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
Better

879
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:31,455
When you see stuff like that when you see him threatening to take away the legal definition

880
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,527
You see the exact

881
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,343
Tactics that are used by people who are trying to

882
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,159
And maybe fascist isn't the right way to go about it

883
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
Because there's a lot of

884
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,511
There's a lot of connection to

885
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
The government itself

886
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,607
Potassium

887
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,655
More interested in himself

888
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,263
The only thing that they've this ultimately from

889
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,799
Descending into a fascist

890
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,103
Authoritarian maybe the best

891
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
Better Label

892
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:05,759
But when you see him coming out and saying I'm not a globalist I'm intentionalist you unpack

893
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,039
Bit of the language

894
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,135
What you're seeing is

895
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
Cheers

896
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,255
Maybe some of them were cheering for the idea of like

897
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
You know

898
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,071
Make America great again

899
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,167
USA USA

900
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,495
But others are cheering for something else

901
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,103
It's the way I think I would put it a little bit differently from

902
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
From the

903
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,735
More specifically it's not that they want to just

904
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
America

905
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,343
America great

906
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
It's what they want to make America great Earth than

907
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
Whatever

908
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
You are

909
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,023
And if that means that we destroy all of yours

910
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,399
What are still comes out a little bit better

911
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,959
It doesn't matter if we destroyed our only

912
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Yours are worse

913
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,799
So we're still great

914
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
I guess here's here's what I would say

915
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,455
Alex is right

916
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,783
Maybe this ultimately is the most important election

917
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
In American history

918
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Because maybe this election

919
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
Everybody's fine

920
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
The f****** picture

921
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,071
And everybody does what the Republicans don't want you to do as you can see my house

922
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
Restricted they're trying to be towards voting right then

923
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,751
Maybe this is the last election we can actually solve

924
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
Refusing to Mom

925
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,079
Because after

926
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,407
After that if they're still in power for the next couple of years

927
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:44,575
Even more horrible s*** and then

928
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
Democratic solution

929
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,439
Because at a certain point democracy lost

930
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
Even in your

931
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,119
Scenario

932
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,447
Even then you still going to have to deal with

933
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
It's going to happen

934
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,663
Excited

935
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,015
As it were

936
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,807
And they're not going to organize

937
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,647
Like the Democratic Socialist Flipside going door-to-door knocking

938
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:24,255
In order to help push rent control kicked out of there

939
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:27,071
They're not going to organize in productive ways

940
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
In terms of helping

941
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,423
People they're going to organize the way Alex would like

942
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Militia

943
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,495
Or the way Gavin McGinnis would like

944
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
Into into

945
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
Street mob

946
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
And that is going to be no matter what

947
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
Need to be addressed

948
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
Because

949
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
They've been given this

950
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Taste of Haiti

951
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,575
Right

952
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,135
If it's no longer in Vogue

953
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
That's another thing on their

954
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
You took away

955
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:06,239
Means

956
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
To cause real harm

957
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:20,831
Already are the end result result behavior is already

958
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,207
Certification will be along the way yet to be determined

959
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
Alex is going to

960
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,047
To be a f****** monster and get people hurt

961
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
It's just going to

962
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,839
To be whether or not

963
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
His guys in power

964
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,471
And he has that narratives or his guy is out of power in ESO

965
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
Doesn't really matter

966
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Point

967
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
We get to

968
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
It's a little bit longer

969
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
But

970
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
On this episode

971
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Again

972
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,951
The day after someone left a bomb in George soros's mailbox

973
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
False flag

974
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Probably

975
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,839
Does mentioned

976
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
Like when he's talking about the refugee Caravan

977
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,239
He does mention sora's probably time for that sort of thing

978
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,055
He does mention him offhandedly a couple time

979
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
But this next clip

980
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
My heart started

981
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Fluttering

982
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:23,295
Like I got that kind of anxiety flutter

983
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,879
Big understand when you hear what he says

984
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
But

985
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,975
It needs to be said

986
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
Did there is no universe

987
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,839
No possible universe that I believe exist

988
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,143
And I believe in the Multiverse

989
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,471
Possibility

990
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,287
Literally every single one of them

991
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,127
Alex Jones knows that someone left a bomb in George soros's mailed

992
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
There is no chance

993
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,783
But he was unaware of that

994
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
There is no way

995
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
But he doesn't know that

996
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
And that is

997
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
Something that he's aware of

998
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,975
When he says the words that he's about to say

999
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,615
I'm on fire defy

1000
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:36,767
Where are your instance where is your common sense

1001
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,839
Is Hardcore I'm not talking to you

1002
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,631
Michelle Austin establishment

1003
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
But it's a spiritual thing

1004
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
And

1005
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:58,015
Misery loves company

1006
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,647
We have to stop going along with

1007
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,303
And their minions.

1008
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,631
They're a bunch of bull

1009
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,031
Ono

1010
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
Program

1011
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,639
Relaunch

1012
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Like we're deaf

1013
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,759
Because the damn we are death

1014
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:34,111
George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Rothschild

1015
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
Reaper

1016
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Come to their door

1017
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,239
Death of their system

1018
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,775
Good save

1019
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,871
Really just love life but she does because

1020
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,687
Shut off our Unborn

1021
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:05,343
It's on our families in two-faced everything

1022
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:16,607
Literally alive and they're psychotic

1023
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
Because they're possessed

1024
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,095
And if you don't stand for The Unborn

1025
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,751
You stand before God God will say

1026
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,543
I know you not

1027
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,663
And you are of the devil

1028
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,479
From which You Came Forever

1029
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
You are not

1030
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Amongst

1031
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
You belong to death Journal

1032
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,535
Bunch of trump clips

1033
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Plate

1034
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
Forget

1035
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:27,007
That if you don't support this broadcast will be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products

1036
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
No one

1037
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,223
Clip is perhaps

1038
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
The poorest taste

1039
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,295
Imagining

1040
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,087
The idea that like

1041
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,695
I think he saved himself a little bit from

1042
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Babylist

1043
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,815
Real real trouble by thing

1044
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
Adestrador system

1045
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,239
Because the day after someone leaves a bomb in George Soros your main enemies mailbox

1046
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
It's probably not wise

1047
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
Come on Aaron's day

1048
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
George Soros

1049
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,407
I'm the Grim Reaper come to your door

1050
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,431
I'm deaf

1051
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
I'm death

1052
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,039
That seems really really f***** up

1053
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,111
The phrase that got me though

1054
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Before that

1055
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Now they know

1056
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
Because I hear that

1057
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Can I hear him

1058
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,887
Responsible

1059
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,495
Now you know that I'm the Grim Reaper

1060
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
Now you know I can

1061
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:37,407
I mean it's certainly the timeline for everything now you know

1062
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,735
Makes a lot more sense than it being like you got Trump elected

1063
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,015
Cuz I was almost two years

1064
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:47,647
PID

1065
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
Was much less

1066
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
Jarring

1067
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
To me then

1068
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
I am death I am death

1069
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,327
Yeah but I mean

1070
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
He's always

1071
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:02,495
He's always saying that better their evil and if you're if you

1072
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:08,127
It's weirdly that they make right with God because if you don't bomb George Soros

1073
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
God is going to hate

1074
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,431
Or whatever the frame

1075
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,735
But the now they know

1076
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,783
Hit so hard because

1077
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Like you said

1078
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
There is no universe

1079
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
He doesn't know

1080
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,415
There's no University

1081
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
We didn't call him immediately

1082
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,583
City of God damn word about Sorel tomorrow

1083
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,399
Kula Kula.

1084
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:35,519
Don't kill him if he's like listen

1085
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,823
I know I had Buckley call you

1086
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
And I feel like

1087
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
That wasn't enough

1088
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,039
At the head

1089
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,839
Listen to reason you don't listen to words

1090
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,935
Call his dad

1091
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
That's terrible

1092
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
No that's

1093
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
Is unconscionably dangerous

1094
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,431
I think that might actually be

1095
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:20,831
I don't think it's a crime man it's it's real bad because it's relishing in the attempted murder of Sue

1096
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,279
The obvious response was gesture their system

1097
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,071
Waterfall Dallas

1098
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,655
You very clearly an afterthought

1099
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
We should kill them politically

1100
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,471
I'm sorta bush

1101
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
I'm deal what you're saying and you know what people work here

1102
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,615
This to me is really f***** up and

1103
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
F***** up without the app

1104
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,551
Killing our kids

1105
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:07,423
What's that a reference to

1106
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,495
Part of your narrative other than pizzagate

1107
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
Clearly

1108
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,407
Something that you pulling from in his memory back

1109
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
In order to make this

1110
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,503
Daredevil to want to kill your kid riff work

1111
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
Doesn't have

1112
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:28,927
The gnomes are coming that he needs and Ivy pulls satanic basement

1113
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,095
That's also f***** up I don't know man

1114
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
Van Heusen

1115
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:44,031
Sure years later it comes up whenever he's talking about

1116
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,823
The guy who just got a bomb put

1117
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
F****** mailbox

1118
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
Mailbox

1119
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
Who Alex said was behind pizzagate

1120
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
The puppet

1121
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,599
So I mean what we have here is like

1122
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,879
I expected

1123
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,159
Bully 2

1124
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
Have the show Oprah

1125
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
Without

1126
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:09,631
No-one to put a bomb in George Soros the mailbox

1127
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:16,031
Never said that to be as angle

1128
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
It'd be like

1129
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
Blame it on us

1130
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:24,223
It's going to be the next thing you know it's going to be Alex Jones made someone bomb Georgia

1131
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:29,599
Already got the predictive programming

1132
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
I thought that would be what he says

1133
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:34,207
The fact that he never addresses directly

1134
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,511
The fact that Torres had a bomb putting

1135
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,559
And says

1136
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,399
I'm the Grim Reaper coming to soros's door I am death

1137
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
I am dad

1138
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
It made me feel

1139
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,751
So sick to my stomach

1140
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
Because like I said

1141
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
Last night

1142
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,407
The experience of watching

1143
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,711
Trump rally

1144
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,015
And then afterwards the news

1145
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
Throws bomb

1146
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159
How does visceral response

1147
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,231
So then the two missing at the Alex

1148
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,791
Wallowing around it like a pig in s***

1149
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,839
It made me feel like

1150
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,655
I guess the only way I described it is

1151
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
When

1152
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Do you know

1153
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,263
Saudi Arabia has clearly murdered a journalist

1154
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,055
You know

1155
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,103
And

1156
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:27,455
Then Trump goes on air I did one of his rallies and talks about

1157
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,783
That I got from Montana body-slamming a journalist

1158
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
Talk about how it's great

1159
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,903
When you have something like that you have something

1160
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Two things

1161
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
Connected

1162
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
There's no way they're not connected

1163
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,327
But they're so inappropriate

1164
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
And they show

1165
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
Such a deep latch

1166
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
If you manatee

1167
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,215
I'm such a deep lack of

1168
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
Anything

1169
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
Resemblance

1170
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
Babe

1171
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
Eat it

1172
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
It's so scary

1173
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,687
It's so scary

1174
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
Furiated

1175
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,623
It will never not be infuriating to know

1176
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
But the Koch brothers

1177
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,463
Truly behind

1178
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,327
The complete destruction of Democracy in America

1179
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:20,191
Not Justa

1180
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:24,543
And their Network the guy to report more money into this

1181
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,079
Anybody else

1182
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Nobody on our things

1183
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,367
Nobody's ever done that

1184
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,791
People's lives

1185
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:52,447
Insider trading in the 80s

1186
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,287
That's that's these people man

1187
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
And they're just

1188
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
F****** thing that that's it

1189
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:09,855
Are we are we all just going to die knowing that we're better people than the people that are murdering us

1190
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,647
This is the struggle

1191
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
I don't know

1192
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Hearthstone

1193
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:18,047
Furiated it is you feel like

1194
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,839
Like they're gaslighting

1195
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,167
You start to feel like you're going

1196
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
There's no reality anymore

1197
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,919
That's what I'm saying that's what I'm talking about when I was saying I feel crazy

1198
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
Where am I

1199
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
I don't know how you get to

1200
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,295
Present yourself as like the good

1201
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
People

1202
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,343
And the victims

1203
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,879
And all that

1204
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,951
You relishing and

1205
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:51,071
Short of breath

1206
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Put a bomb

1207
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
Somebody's mailbox

1208
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
Your team

1209
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,727
Murdered a woman at a

1210
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:04,127
Owner of

1211
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,783
And every excuse to be anti-Semitic

1212
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
An antenna islamophobe

1213
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,367
When your team is

1214
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
Incarcerating children

1215
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
Keeping any records

1216
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:23,583
Is it not even trying to fulfill the court-ordered of putting the family back together

1217
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,119
Your team is the victim

1218
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,679
And your team is even

1219
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,055
Encroaching on its own ideology

1220
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:33,823
Those things

1221
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
Because they make up

1222
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:39,455
Philosophy is

1223
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
There is no there is no

1224
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
Nothing to The Republic there's nothing now but

1225
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
It doesn't

1226
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,535
It does feel like that is what's driving

1227
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,375
I told you I couldn't sleep last night

1228
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,191
Things that I decided to spend my time doing

1229
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,471
Was

1230
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,751
Play little Candy Crush

1231
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:07,871
Good luck and then I decided I'm not going to get to sleep

1232
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:12,735
I decided to look into and make sure I understood all of the accusations

1233
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,015
Against George Soros

1234
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
The people like Alex Jones

1235
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
He's elk make

1236
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,903
And it led me to watching a bunch of you

1237
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,183
YouTube videos that are released

1238
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,255
A lot of them are clearly Alex Jones

1239
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
Rip off

1240
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:31,167
No not use on their videos but are doing like an impression

1241
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
Embarrassing to watch

1242
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,263
You understand the reason

1243
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,335
He's f****** talented like you had

1244
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
Doesn't

1245
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
Miss beat user

1246
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,575
I can deliver as line

1247
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
Yeah it's

1248
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,183
Versions of Alex

1249
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:01,631
This is disgusting that there are

1250
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
A lot of them we've covered on the show already

1251
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,471
Many of them

1252
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,055
Never

1253
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,847
If anybody wants to come at

1254
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,895
And talk about sora's

1255
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,199
I will smack down anybody

1256
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,991
About it

1257
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,135
Maybe this publicly

1258
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,439
But anybody who has these

1259
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
Sort of ideas

1260
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,255
About George Soros

1261
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
I can

1262
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
And then explain to you

1263
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,679
How's the beliefs that you have that is wrong

1264
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,215
And not based in reality

1265
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,031
It actually ties back to anti-semitic propaganda

1266
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:47,199
So I was going to lay that all out on the show sometime

1267
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:53,599
For that other stuff is just

1268
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,135
And little

1269
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Straight

1270
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,463
Accusations that were made by likely

1271
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,999
Lyndon larouche

1272
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,535
Of the world

1273
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:07,935
There's nothing like I said

1274
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,263
It wasn't really that big of a deal and he gave him

1275
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,031
Money back and

1276
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,847
And it's debatable whether he actually acted

1277
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
With

1278
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
Whatever

1279
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:25,343
You want to take all weekend we can stipulate that one

1280
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,719
Billionaires

1281
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
So anyway

1282
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,791
That that that

1283
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,607
The most unpleasant part of this episode and like I told you

1284
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
Since we've made it through

1285
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,935
We now get to have something

1286
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,495
And that is what Alex Jones is

1287
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,431
Okay yeah the guy named Ricky Berwick

1288
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
He's a guy who makes

1289
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,487
YouTube videos

1290
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:07,071
Little short YouTube videos

1291
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,911
I don't hate the hustle

1292
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,455
There were three or four

1293
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,855
But I suspect that there's only one video of his metallics have ever seen

1294
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,391
Needs to shut up

1295
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,791
Expert analysis

1296
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
Decided

1297
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,863
Disgaea

1298
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:48,543
So he's a special guest interview at this does not

1299
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,151
Goes away

1300
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,223
How would you describe yourself

1301
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
Free speech

1302
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,319
I like names

1303
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,111
Like

1304
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,927
We're all having fun

1305
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,071
NSYNC

1306
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,119
Purge of free speech

1307
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,215
Social Jess

1308
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,239
Fastest way home

1309
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,287
A lot of them recently

1310
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,407
A lot of people

1311
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Liara

1312
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
We are sick

1313
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
You notice those jumps

1314
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,319
What happen if you keep swearing

1315
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,487
Catholic

1316
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
Hopefully got it it

1317
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:50,239
We're on our way

1318
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:53,311
Nan Kings English me a big favor

1319
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:04,319
So in the middle of their conversation about free speech

1320
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,343
English

1321
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,487
I know that there's differences between swearing and like breaking SEC violations in different countries

1322
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,023
I just think there's a certain

1323
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,071
Siematic irony

1324
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:23,007
Kind of reveal

1325
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:27,871
Alex

1326
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,015
You are right I think we should do that you are right and you are an interesting fella

1327
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,159
BBW does not go how Alex wanted to as we've already seen

1328
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,535
Don't stop swearing

1329
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,655
That is

1330
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:57,567
You're not having fun and I've also been kicked off most parsley

1331
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:08,319
Hey man seems to be Ricky's whole thing he seems to be having a blast

1332
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Like it's not for me

1333
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
I get to the lotto

1334
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
Alex

1335
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
His Realty

1336
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,495
I want to be heard In that clip that

1337
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
Ricky is super into

1338
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,103
Alien guy

1339
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,919
No Alex is super into this end

1340
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,271
Turn on playable character meme at the moment

1341
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:43,647
I'm so so good about it

1342
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
He does not care

1343
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,047
What do you think of impeach

1344
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,447
Rachel it's a great meme

1345
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,031
What do you think is going to go then

1346
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,591
I think it's going to die like a man

1347
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,943
Hahaha

1348
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:19,999
I have rarely heard through people

1349
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:26,399
Have such bad chemistry and it's one person's fault and ethos

1350
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:34,591
Saddest sentence I think I've ever heard Alexei

1351
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,615
Some people call me the

1352
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,431
The Eternal mean

1353
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,503
NPC meme

1354
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,343
Ricky is like

1355
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:51,743
People aren't like that very much against them

1356
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,583
Because it's commercial

1357
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
Ricki Lake

1358
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,775
I just figured

1359
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,359
Annoys people

1360
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:14,783
Rosewood

1361
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,815
We're running against

1362
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,631
Because the Fabian socialist told us to use emojis

1363
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,703
War with them with me

1364
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:38,591
Fabian socialist

1365
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
Again

1366
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,783
I got nothing but respect for

1367
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:51,135
So at this point Alex spot something in the camera shot

1368
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,183
Everything was going so badly

1369
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,975
But you hear the positive

1370
01:10:55,231 --> 01:11:00,095
They're not connected in any way

1371
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
To try and like

1372
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,423
Talk about

1373
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
Piggy bank

1374
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
What's what's his name

1375
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,575
Quest.

1376
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:24,671
You have the hammer a lot

1377
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:29,535
Gorilla

1378
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,351
The reason that I'm

1379
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,375
People

1380
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,167
Like what I do

1381
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:40,799
You can ask about that if you want the stupid I got over here

1382
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:46,175
That is desperate

1383
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
What

1384
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,247
Oh that's a

1385
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,367
He asked about the hammer

1386
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,903
But

1387
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
54 absolutely

1388
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
But

1389
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:04,607
The the hound dog come back on

1390
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,799
And even further than we all know that he's a dog

1391
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
He can't resist killing it

1392
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,151
This is what happens next

1393
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,039
Why are you so

1394
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,855
In love with my hair

1395
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,879
I want you to kill it

1396
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,183
You want okay okay

1397
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
What

1398
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,071
I like dogs but you know what that one that looks like

1399
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
Where's Knox

1400
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
I want you to

1401
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,215
I want you to kill it

1402
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
You want me to kill it

1403
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,151
I was just joking

1404
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:56,575
This is f***** up yeah I mean you don't really need

1405
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
Shut the f****** conversation

1406
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:04,255
It's a f*****-up way for it to go super weird for him to just

1407
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:08,863
Obsessively want dogs dad whether real or fake dogs

1408
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,703
Seems to be so consistent in his character

1409
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,007
Even his jokes are like

1410
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,799
Hahaha murder

1411
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,127
Right right right

1412
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:26,527
Joke

1413
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,807
Cirrhosis

1414
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,135
Responsible for him to even be like

1415
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,439
That look dog

1416
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,719
Yeah it's not

1417
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,511
This is

1418
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,535
Foremost

1419
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,095
Public discourse

1420
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
Was an attempt at comedy

1421
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
It was

1422
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:52,383
He thought he was doing some real fun

1423
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,711
So he's got this memory in there Getzlaf

1424
01:13:55,967 --> 01:14:00,319
Cuz if he does have some shots as you can tell the timing is pretty

1425
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,927
It's no like using tag team this thing

1426
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
That was the result

1427
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,975
It was the result

1428
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,279
You want me to grab my

1429
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
Kill the dog

1430
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,119
We shouldn't allow people with right-wing

1431
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,679
Because it only makes them a

1432
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,471
Angrier and more prone to

1433
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
It's for their own good

1434
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,615
Department

1435
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,919
Alex's dad

1436
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,711
But don't think that's a good idea

1437
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,527
There needs to be somebody already has a bit

1438
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,927
There needs to be some sort of body in place

1439
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,231
Hey man a note

1440
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:45,887
Got to go we got to get ahead we got to get a union and are union rep would come in and be like hey dude no no no no

1441
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
We want you to

1442
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,263
There's

1443
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,031
Just not enough

1444
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,895
We've there's no more spots open

1445
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
Ever

1446
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,711
Ever

1447
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,479
Ever

1448
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,247
Trevor

1449
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,623
Like a version of Alex Jones

1450
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
Comedy

1451
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,671
But

1452
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,207
And our last question

1453
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,255
Alex Jones discusses

1454
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,791
Field comedy

1455
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,839
But he did while he was out of the Trump rally

1456
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:21,471
Monster

1457
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,007
Oh I forget I forgot.

1458
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Hit it with a hammer

1459
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,087
Monster

1460
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,511
Who's like this station

1461
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
Jobs dead

1462
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,983
What do I have to do

1463
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,039
Beto O'Rourke

1464
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,007
Contacts cuz I know you're not on social media so you may not have seen

1465
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
Is Alex

1466
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:34,175
Standing over some dogs on the street

1467
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,223
Or maybe horseshit I think he says it's horseshit

1468
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,783
And yelling at this poop

1469
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,695
If comedy alright

1470
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:51,071
Mean it it would be comedy

1471
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
Man

1472
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,959
You just got to figure out how,

1473
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:01,311
Video

1474
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,103
The video that Alex put out

1475
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,151
It just appears to be him yelling at

1476
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,455
You on the ground but someone else

1477
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:11,807
Was there and got it on their camera

1478
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,951
Realized I got some level

1479
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,511
You're doing this and Lexie

1480
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,303
People are just watching you yell at

1481
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,607
Hilarious

1482
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Do the poop

1483
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,031
Supposed to be beta

1484
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,615
Alright

1485
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,639
You're supposed to make

1486
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,431
Connection in your mind that Beto

1487
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,015
The problem is Alex

1488
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,807
Much like Dennis Miller is

1489
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
Funny

1490
01:17:55,071 --> 01:18:01,215
Nickelback

1491
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,103
Marco Rubio

1492
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,479
What's his real name

1493
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,903
Yelling it

1494
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,303
Timbertop coming over like what in the hell

1495
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:33,215
Where you go

1496
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,239
That was it

1497
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,823
Mexican Harvest pendejo that's the t-shirts

1498
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
Did it smell

1499
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,855
I didn't get to close

1500
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,183
Listen to stupid

1501
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,231
Talks to poop

1502
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Alex

1503
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,327
Alex

1504
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,167
Yeah

1505
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,311
Do you just roll along with it

1506
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:14,687
Response

1507
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,479
Textures your B

1508
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,527
Extend your bed

1509
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,087
Hey many ideas I can punch it up

1510
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:26,975
Are you saying like all the media is all saying that I talked to poo

1511
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,535
You were

1512
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
You did

1513
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,351
Everyone knows that you were

1514
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,423
Attempting a joke

1515
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,263
They're just laughing at how bad it is

1516
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
So Alex

1517
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:44,895
Appreciate that you so incompetent when it comes to Comedy

1518
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,687
Because it makes it a little more

1519
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,271
Alex's Legacy Federal hamburger had no idea what

1520
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,135
Search the s*** right there is

1521
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,999
Malaria

1522
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
I think the

1523
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,655
Media is just not getting

1524
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:21,504
Then I got to really go for

1525
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
Your videos

1526
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
Get it

1527
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,672
Done

1528
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Right

1529
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:39,424
Brings us to the end of this episode sink

1530
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,824
I'm answering every time we do a Monster episode

1531
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,384
I mean

1532
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
So bad

1533
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,784
Stupidness show is so bad

1534
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,088
Every single time I listen

1535
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,624
In the present

1536
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,232
How bad this show is

1537
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,280
How little it needs to exist

1538
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
And

1539
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:13,984
What do you mean how else would we have found out about that let's just show is vital

1540
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
Irrelevant

1541
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,544
If if

1542
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,592
You if you didn't have Alex Jones

1543
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,664
Just look at this show

1544
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,944
Where would we be

1545
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
Yeezys

1546
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,536
The interview

1547
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,632
Such a good interviewer

1548
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,496
The show stick

1549
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:50,336
Much like that horse manure the show stink

1550
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:52,384
I believe he said that

1551
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:57,504
Unreliable narrator

1552
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
Beetroot

1553
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,344
It's just as bad

1554
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,904
It's terrible I think that his rhetoric

1555
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,696
As it relates to

1556
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,768
In particular

1557
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,560
George Soros is

1558
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:17,216
Just the definition of dangerous super irresponsible and the sort of thing they cannot like

1559
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:17,984
It's

1560
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,008
That sort of behavior

1561
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800
They're people like

1562
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,104
2 years of my life

1563
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
Dedicatedly

1564
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,688
Studying Alex Jones

1565
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,736
Almost a year now

1566
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,320
Studying this guy that I hate

1567
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,904
And if someone put a bomb in his mailbox

1568
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,720
I would be nothing but sympathetic to him

1569
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,024
I would think that was the worst thing

1570
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Ever

1571
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,328
I would come on this show

1572
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,632
I would talk about how awful that is

1573
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
And how's that is not the way.

1574
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Things are done

1575
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,776
It's not the way that we deal with these sorts of issues

1576
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,480
I mean that in the sense of life

1577
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,016
There's still time

1578
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,088
There's still time for that not to be the

1579
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
Tissues like that

1580
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,928
Eventually you get to world war

1581
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:16,352
This to happen I'm not right right right right

1582
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:22,752
There's only one with negotiate a peace treaty with Germany running the world

1583
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:25,312
Like we talked about at the top of

1584
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
Episode

1585
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
The parallels

1586
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,664
To the rise of fascism

1587
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,456
Are there

1588
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,760
Strong and they are only getting

1589
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:36,320
Stronger right

1590
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
The way that we

1591
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
Deal with it

1592
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
Needs to be

1593
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:42,976
Counter

1594
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:47,328
To ever allowing it to get that far but I'm the way that you remember the

1595
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
The urgency of it

1596
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,632
Is you remember how

1597
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,400
Historically

1598
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,424
Quit it

1599
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,728
The truth

1600
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,776
That's what I figured I'm not thinking like

1601
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,432
Now is the time we need to make sure we don't go

1602
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,712
And if weird

1603
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:10,112
If we're putting it off it's it's somewhere off in the distant future something

1604
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,952
Like that you're not

1605
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
Done

1606
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,256
In a good way

1607
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
Now

1608
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,048
Because

1609
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,864
If nobody does anything about it if we don't fight

1610
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,656
If we don't make sure that this is

1611
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Carob

1612
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,704
Will get

1613
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,312
Is not negotiable thing that's not a

1614
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:33,408
That's an exaggeration

1615
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,992
So we may never get there but it's going to require work

1616
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,832
George Soros open Society

1617
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,368
Free societies

1618
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,160
Require

1619
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,952
They require

1620
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,768
Generally exist

1621
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,304
Without working

1622
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Driving

1623
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,192
And I I I agree on that

1624
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
On that end

1625
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
But

1626
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,056
I don't know all my point was

1627
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,592
Was that

1628
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,176
The person I hate the most in the world and I think is one of the most

1629
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,200
Cancerous

1630
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Awful

1631
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,040
Influences on people's lives

1632
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,088
Sound

1633
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,136
Disgusting rabbit holes

1634
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,696
I would never treat him the way he

1635
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,792
The high road

1636
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,584
That is just me saying

1637
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,656
I can't imagine anyone who would

1638
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,936
Do act like that

1639
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,496
I already said I would never want to be around them

1640
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,312
I just hate this guy

1641
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,592
This guy too

1642
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,664
No

1643
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,200
Do not

1644
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,064
Yeah your combs

1653
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:38,848
But just needed to be talked about and now it's done

1654
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,408
And I'd like to say from the bottom of my heart

1655
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
I mean this sincerely

1656
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,016
Whoever left that bomb is George soros's house I'm glad

1657
