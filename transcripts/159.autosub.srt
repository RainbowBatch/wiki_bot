Talk a little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:23,808
These intros are becoming very tortured in the link that they are taking

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
And I for one feel like the intro should be short

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Should be

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
You get in you get out

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:37,376
You make sure if I did I everybody knows

9
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,776
Right now suppose llaman how to shorten the intros of the 12th let's do that

10
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:50,176
Are in our listeners time the brevity is the soul of wit

00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,120

We

61
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
Like the world is so in

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
Only way to relieve ourselves of the insanity is to raise the bar

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Right right fun level

64
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
From some of the research that I've done it seems like the guy we're going to be talking about today likes to soupy

65
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
Okay

66
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,663

Until we get

70
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
But my way of saying

71
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
No setup

72
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695

76
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Have have stopped to work

And that the regular sexy has with an extraterrestrial is causing tension in his human marriage

Not the Black Panther be

123
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,447
Her name is the cat that's what he refers to her as

124
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
Certainly not with the person who is the mother of your child

125
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151

00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:29,183
What will happen is that I will say I am ready

139
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
I bet

140
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,471
And then the technology I don't understand will take us up to a craft orbiting the Earth

141
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,591
He said right the Labour politician is also claimed he was abducted by extraterrestrials as a child

142
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
And that his real mother is an alien with eight fingers

143
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
Alright alright he said

144
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
I think it's total

145
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
How many hands

146
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
That's a great question he did not specify he said quote it's a personal matter and doesn't affect my work

147
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
Personal convictions business Nevada

148

Kohl's people don't want me to talk about aliens

149
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,503
I get more common sense out of the aliens been out of Scarborough Town Hall

150
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
Okay okay wait

151
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319

He told the Yorkshire post

156
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,863
I'm completely in the dark about that

157
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,775
Well it is a personal matter

158
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
That's a good quote on background is amazing

159
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
No comment

160
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
I found another article from The Daily Star in 2015

161
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
That's exactly the article start

162
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,327
Apartments of Simon parkes fifty-three-year-old of turning Whitby Town Council in North York

163
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Into a laughingstock

164
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:18,495
With us outlandish believes in conspiracy theories about government cover-ups UFOs non-humans of the Illuminati

165
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
Earlier this year he claimed that the armed separatist conflict in Ukraine have been sparked by an alien race called the nordics

166
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:34,367
Sure keeping this effort from your work

167
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
Hold on let me ask you a question

168
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
What are his policy position

169
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Because frankly if he's just a really good counselor who believes in saying s*** better than

170
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
Maybe maybe

171
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
This guy over Paul Ryan

172
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
And you can quote me

173
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
On that

174
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Alien newspaper

175
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
I would like

176
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
There's not a lot of Nordic related issues in the stakes Beyond Whitby community property

177
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
Right so maybe he could keep it separated I'm not entirely sure

178
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Still going

179
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,799
2015 is what he's stepping down from office

180
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
Driving instructor mr. Park

181
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295
The announcer yesterday he was resigning as a Labour councillor for States B Ward

182
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,367
Because his workload left no time for his Civic duties

183
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
Need more time to teach people to drive

184
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Fair enough

185
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:47,583
Former Whitby mayor and leaving local Tori Scarborough councillor Dorothy Clegg said quote

186
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,935
I don't think my real opinion of this is principal

187
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Bring me because her real opinion

188
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
She's a Tori Mare

189
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,207
Which makes her a worse person on

190
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,559
I just love the idea that these articles reached out to other people in their answer to like

191
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,399
I'm in the dark what I have to say about that

192
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:29,055
Guys do a little bit of the flavors I'm in Parkesburg

193
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
You want to take a look at

194
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
His voting record

195
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,455
Astonishingly good

196
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
Is all about income inequality

197
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Being an issue and I don't think it matters

198
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
If what he really thinks is that income inequality is an issue

199
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
Because the Nordic

200
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
I'm all about it

201
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
So these are worse than people who believe in

202
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,103
For the series of episodes

203
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
What up brother

204
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
You understand

205
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:09,759
Project Camelot Richard episode

206
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575

207
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111

Remote viewed motor

209
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,351
Talk about that this came out and it kind of relates to Mark Richards

210
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,167
Okay

211
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Immediately off the heel

212
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Nobody does know somebody Aaliyah

213
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Wait like this email

214
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,991
Well you'll remember in that last Mark Richards episode talked about some concerns he had about

215
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
About the

216
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Because we've got some disagreement

217
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
On the Mantis

218
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
We got issues

219
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
We got it

220
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
So

221
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Why don't you go ahead and

222
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,655
And we're going to talk about the Manta

223
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Agenda

224
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
That's one of the big subject

225
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
Stewart Edina

226
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Remote viewing

Real quick

228
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
I watched a good bit of Brett Stewart

229
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Remote viewing

230
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Amman

231
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
It looks good

232
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,599
I mean about viewing the video itself

233
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
Really well there's a lot of a lot of you

234
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303

We have five times the amount of numbers

236
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Donate to that

237
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
You do want to watch the f***

238
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Exactly

239
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
The reason his rub

240
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Mobile

241
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
Stewart

242
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
And his team

243
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,991
Got excellent results when they've used

244
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Alien

245
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,111
And so that's why we really

246
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
Want to be able

247
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
Talk about that

248
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Because

249
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Before

250
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Their investigative

251
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Came up with answers

252
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Brett Stewart

253
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:12,639

00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Of course

263
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:36,447
What is the man

264
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
I'm fine with that

265
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
We'll get to the mantid agenda here a little bit

266
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Remote viewing got great results. Even know what

267
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479

00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
Two great results would be let alone bad result emailed the f****** Nazca Lines before anybody

00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
The real world

270
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,607
Another crazy person had

271
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007

Hold on

274
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Cuz

275
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,967
That might be what we're dealing with educated to this remote viewing

276
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
I don't want to tip my hat too early

277
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Simon

278
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
Not a fan of this remote viewing

279
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Hurry up

280
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
So that's kind of a unique

281
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Situation

282
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
Gotten

283
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,351

What's the target as well

288
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
He ended up with

289
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
And then he ended up

290
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,015
With information about the method agenda

291
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575

Ebook

304
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Spoiler alert

305
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,319
I just prefer El Rancho mexican restaurant Columbia Missouri

306
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
Love Caso Cerrado

307
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Look

308
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
It's a book

309
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,399
I keep it in the truck

310
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703

00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
Nope nope

312
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
It's

313
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
It's a choice I was fine with the second

314
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
Are the second

315
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
-1

316
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319
Material that has to do with like the nature of the universe

317
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,463
Like solar system and we perceive ourselves to be and there's lots of aliens around

318
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
Okay. Is like

319
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,583
A complete reinterpretation of

320
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
This Christ

321
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,567
Some of that here in a little bit but

322
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
The idea that this guy brat

323
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
I can't remember his last name to remote view the author of the Urantia book

324
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
And he found

325
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Mantis beings

326
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Wait

327
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,415
Behind him while he was offering it or just like

328
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,095
For it or whatever

329
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
I did a lot of looking

330
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,727
Into the Urantia book good idea because I was like

331
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
So I started looking into it

332
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
And here's the story

333
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Of the ranch

334
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Business

335
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Perhaps one of the weirdest

336
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
That we're ever going to have to have accidentally stumbled into

337
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
It was written by this guy named dr. William Sadler

338
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,535
Do not trust the doctor in front of his name was Freud for a year while then I really don't trust

339
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
The doctor in front of his

340
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,191
So he claimed that he wrote a book with the help of a mysterious individual another man

341
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Invented

342
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,543
No

343
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
Andy was married to Lana Celestia Kellogg

344
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,199

351

00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,623
Listen to something amazing

354
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,255
Man the lot of it had roots in Seventh-day Adventist beliefs

355
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
A lot of it had to do with like eugenic

356
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Maxi beliefs

357
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863

Money coming in and everything

370
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
Kellogg took the sanitarium from Seventh-Day

371
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Ownership and they'd

372
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
Until when Kellogg got kicked out of the church

378
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
Sadler left with him

379
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,456
Is I guess uncle-in-law it would be

380
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
He left with him

381
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Sometime in between

382
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Between 1906 and 1911

383
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Become a psychologist

384
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,672
S10e ended up with a patiently

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
So he ended up with a patient with a stamp just be like

386
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
Armasight College

387
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,752
Today the patient with a weird sleeping condition

388
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:08,384
Apparently came over as I hate this guy needs my husband needs your help alright automatic writing

389
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
That might come into it eventually

390
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Weatherman

391
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,528
What he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an alien

392
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,600
Naturally being a man of science that Saddle Ranch

393
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Test on the dude determined him to be

394
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Be completely saying

395
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
And that he was actually channeling aliens in Eastlake

396
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Kitchen rugs

397
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
Capital of Dominica little rubber mallet

398
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Primitive life

399
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,312
Oh well clearly you serving him for years

400
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
The real alien of

401
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
Resume the test

402
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:48,064
Waiting is he going to show like real manifest

403
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,672
Super years he he would converse with a sleeping man and write down what he said

404
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
IOffer

405
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,512
And all that work would eventually become the Urantia book

406
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
There's other pieces that end up

407
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
Coming into a 223

408
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:06,752
Because your answer is the name that these aliens say is the actual name of Earth

409
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
That other aliens call Earth

410
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
That's the official name of

411
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,920
Well wouldn't own name for

412
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
America America

413
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Instead of whatever name

414
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:23,392
The native LazyTown Zuni

415
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,584
I don't disagree

416
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
Sleeping mat

417
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,192
Yo-yo

418
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
So

419
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
Would keep this man's identity

420
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,152
Allegedly because he didn't want any ill repute

421
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
To come to Amber court case things go bad but multiple researchers who looked into it and suggested they believe it was his brother-in-law

422
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Call Wilfred Kellogg

423
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
So

424
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
People running a scam

425
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:03,840
This is an elaborate scam.

426
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
Discussion groups in his home attended by friends colleagues

427
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,728
Suspiciously former patients

428
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Odd

429
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
It's probably just

430
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Believer

431
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
Right right I want to keep up with you

432
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
Atopic

433
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,232
The fourth such meeting the topic of this Geico

434
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Came up that he was talk

435
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Asleep

436
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:40,192
Sailor would later reports of the group that they had been given permission to discuss with a sleeping man had said

437
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,752
And try and come up with Workshop good questions

438
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
Next time you go

439
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Now

440
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Frankly

441
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
Alright

442
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Good organization

443
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:56,064
Who doesn't want a very solid

444
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,136
Plan if you if you know you have a reason

445
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
To really dig into that

446
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
You can't just go in there half-cocked

447
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:09,888
You got to get everybody together

448
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
First question

449
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
The fuc

450
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
Next question for real

451
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Question

452
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
How do you

453
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
Feel about all the

454
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Right right

455
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
Do you think it should be called Earth

456
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
We all do

457
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,832
So that group would go on to become become known as the Urantia book for

458
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,696
Annie96 became a formal group and sworn to secrecy

459
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
Throughout the entire

460
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
History of the Forum

461
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
Only five people ever knew who the sleeping man was

462
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632
Including the sleeping man himself

463
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,312
Pruvit Sadler and his wife that's for

464
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
The sleeping man

465
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Kellogg

466
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
No, is the brother-in-law

467
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,480
No that's what I'm saying

468
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,320
The dad John Harvey Kellogg

469
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,672
I don't know

470
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,488
Thousands of pages of

471
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
In the spirits

472
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,216
Ages of Diaries kept by Forum members Harold and Martha Sherman were released

473
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
They paint a portrait of Saddler as a witch

474
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Surprise Noah

475
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,664
In them he describes the papers Herald

476
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
Describe the papers about the life of Jesus

477
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
But ended up

478
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Stop being channeled

479
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
As being golden tablets he describes them as quote fictitious unnatural hackneyed uninspired distasteful

480
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Offensive inconsistent

481
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
And peppered with cliches and time-worn phrases

482
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
They are poorly written Hodge

483
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
To the Core

484
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Is

485
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
Thorough

486
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Thorough

487
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,848
Down but you know what

488
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,944
I'm off work just like the golden tablets

489
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,248
Them

490
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
Edward himself resides

491
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
The Jesus papers

492
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Perhaps even wrote Porsche

493
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:10,464
Constantly lashes Sadler for burning the original manuscripts making it impossible for

494
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,560
Scholars to learn how radically they may have been altered

495
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Yep

496
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Literally the same story

497
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Exactly

498
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
Analysis suggested that a great deal of the content

499
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
In the the book itself is outright plagiarism

500
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,408
Princeton's on page 3 of the book there's a long passage on 7 ways to

501
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Define absolute

502
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Perfection

503
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,040
The passenger take his memory has taken almost word-for-word

504
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
From philosopher Charles Hartshorne

505
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
1941 book

506
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
Man's vision of God

507
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,000
Is a flagrant shameful plagiarism that could have been the basis for legal action

508
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
Departure on had known about it and wanted to sue for copyright violation notice

509
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
Septic Martin Gardner

510
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
Who wrote a book about the

511
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Books

512
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Call The Ranch at the great cult mystery

513
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
It lays out numerous additional plagiarism

514
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,152
It also notes the Curious presents

515
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:07,040
A very specifically Seventh-day Adventist beliefs in the material supposedly channel for aliens

516
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,600
Such as the doctrine of school sleep

517
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
And

518
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Soldier

519
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,512
So sleep is the the belief that in between lives

520
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Look for you

521
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
You come back right then your soul is

522
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Your soul is resting

523
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
In between any reincarnation

524
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,080
As opposed to their being a time before you were born where your soul is alive

525
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
Jumping out yet there's like a rest.

526
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
Specifically as Adventist belief that they

527
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Including their weirdo

528
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Is annihilation

529
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
Which is the at the end of

530
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,440
I don't know whenever Godwin's a lot of people and fallen angels

531
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
We'll just

532
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Not exist

533
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,048
Dark Souls will be completely destroyed

534
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
Whereas

535
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Anna lotto in normal Christian doctrine that's

536
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
So whatever

537
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
It's suspicious

538
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,896
Interesting that you have very specifically Seventh Day Adventist

539
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,968
Beliefs coming through channeled miraculously by

540
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,272
This Fallen Seventh-Day

541
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
Just you left for his weirdo

542
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Kellogg

543
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,488
Uncle another relative was probably the guy who was faking being asleep

544
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
Like

545
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
Teresa Library

546
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
Fallen 7

547
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
So it seems like maybe those beliefs were just sort of in their heads

548
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
And I

549
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
And came out on the page

550
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Kitsap Direct

551
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
21

552
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
It's all 7th Avenue

553
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,552
Because they have been removed from actually being a part of the church

554
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
He just

555
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
Probably whoever wrote it was

556
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
Going off the Dome trying to remember it couldn't

557
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Couldn't find the book

558
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,144
Yeah some of the doctrine of Seventh-day Adventist

559
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,496
Do they Bible it up or are they related

560
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,336
Hello

561
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
But do you

562
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
There is a time

563
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,992
Rancho book was published in 1955

564
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,296
And that's a long time after this group started meeting

565
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,880
One of the reasons that people believe that

566
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Took that long

567
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,952
And Saddler when it got published

568
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Was like I have finally gotten permission

569
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
We can publish these

570
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Aliens

571
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
From

572
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,936
The reason that this Thai Garden

573
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
He believes

574
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
If the reason is

575
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
Is because a lot of people in the group

576
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
We're his expectation

577
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,104
And he was using this as a way of sort of

578
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
Haven't they caught like

579
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
Environment where he leader

580
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,016
The only people with access to information

581
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:51,648
And you didn't want to lose that control my publishing all of them and so he waited until

582
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
55

583
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,560
You got to do that now you got to make sure you live it up

584
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Jordan

585
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
You know where they did

586
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Battle Creek

587
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
On the 500 block of

588
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Diversey

589
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
Tear in Chicago

590
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
We got to go to that building

591
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,832
Image to where the Urantia book happen

592
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,672
I've been outside that building

593
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
Not a real place

594
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
I don't know I don't know

595
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
You know the building

596
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
From outside of yourself

597
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
Coincidence

598
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
Is the Trump Tower

599
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,704
Pretty hilarious

600
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,312
Hypothetical too far north

601
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,944
It's like that's an area I probably over there by

602
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:54,624
Farm

603
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
The basement bar

604
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,232
Let's do an intro again where will it last another ten

605
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Forget

606
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,096
Whatever problems with the Urantia book

607
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Based on

608
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Pretty talking about Galway Bay

609
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,728
Yeah that's it

610
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
You can come up with that either of you.

611
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Appreciate that

612
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
I have a problem

613
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
With the ranch

614
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
A book based on everything I can

615
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
I can glean from it

616
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,136
Pic dude who was running a elaborate con

617
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
And you never heard of a sociopathic

618
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,744
Good autumn

619
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
I respect the hustle

620
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
But in hindsight

621
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
Come on now bunch of passages from it

622
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
And they're all just like

623
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
They belong on it

624
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
Inspirational word add a calendar add a calendar

625
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Yeah

626
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
Crazy look

627
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
Franklin

628
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
It kind of

629
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
Makes more sense for aliens

630
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
To be just as bad as human beings as

631
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,160
Is it as for anything else

632
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,720
So we have a problem

633
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
Three times now

634
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
Not your fault

635
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
I've blown it aside

636
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,216
Portside 5th time

637
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,776

638
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Blaziken

639
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944

Remote viewing

641
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,528
And I'm going to tell you what that is great

642
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552

6

663
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:25,664
The word America

664
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Is it

665
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,528
Like fully understand

666
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,376
Fair enough that's a good point so he's good

667
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
He thinks it's of the devil

668
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,264
If he comes to the conclusion

669
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
But this is a dumb f*** thing

670
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
To do

671
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
What does it really matter why

672
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
No no no no no don't believe our at least it appears he believes that it was legitimately

673
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Like Channel

674
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,672
And the backstory of it is true it's just that whoever was channeling it got

675
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Trick

676
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,000
Is it thinking that it wasn't satanic in nature

677
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
What are you saying yes

678
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,960
Basically

679
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Love it

680
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,920
I love it when Conrad are like you got caught

681
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,552
Dial

682
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
So

683
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Now we get into his

684
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
His critique of this

685
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
Remote viewing

686
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
Brett whatever dick

687
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
So here's that yours his take on it

688
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:53,216
It again if the end result is like yes this guy is full of s*** then we can agree on that but

689
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Ontario

690
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Send me videos

691
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
I just called

692
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Everything

693
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
Extraterrestrial everything

694
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,352
First of all let's take a moment to enjoy

695
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,472
Carrie's lasswell haha as if they could put that in one video

696
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,152
It's a very simple title

697
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
In the presentation

698
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
Brett Stewart

699
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
YouTube videos

700
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
And I'm going to keep everything so far

701
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
The one point

702
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
There is a drawing

703
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Reedley

704
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,496
Similar to the drawing depressed

705
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
Uses in his presentation

706
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Puppies

707
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Music

708
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
For what

709
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
The presentation which is

710
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
Along the way

711
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Rob

712
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
Because they

713
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Listing

714
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Direct

715
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Also

716
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
Reset.

717
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,728
Extra joints on the next underarms

718
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
I don't

719
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
Hardcore rule of Threes right there

720
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Exactly

721
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
I have

722
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,720
This problem with it I have this problem with it and let me tell you something

723
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,864
Manta don't have oily skin

724
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:01,216
I have to I have to tell you how delighted I was when is he and he's like

725
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
I am

726
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Shock

727
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
Basically what he say

728
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
I will meet you for pistols at dawn

729
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
He's saying that Brett's

730
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
Stewart is

731
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,784
100-percent what he saying is that he plagiarized

732
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
His remote viewing

733
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
From this YouTube video

734
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
And he's not talking about mantis

735
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
No sir

736
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
He is not

737
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Go get to that

738
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,888
We need to deal with the plagiarism a little more in this Mexico

739
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
I believe

740
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
When you accuse someone of plagiarism

741
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
You're in validating

742
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
Not only the work

743
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
Your invalidating their process

744
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Anyway here's

745
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Ears

746
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Here is

747
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Can't remember his name

748
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Assignment

749
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Sleepy here is Simon

750
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
On the pleasure ism

751
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
It's time can I just break it

752
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
Can't hear

753
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Asking you which

754
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
First

755
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Brett

756
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
You ignore this

757
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
So-called website

758
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Great question

759
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,896
Okay so it was a year before I stopped very very

760
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,480
Christine

761
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,576
Well aware that we're doing

762
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
Discussion today and

763
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
He is going

764
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,232
Come on

765
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:31,840
Traveling at the moment

766
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,400
And he is an admirer of yours

767
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Now you're not

768
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
Anybody who knows me

769
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
That's what I'm doing what I'm saying is

770
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
Shoes with this particular

771
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Piece of work

772
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
The weather's issues

773
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
That's a that's a weird line

774
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:18,432
Also what you ask their what is that funky this

775
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Kind of sad

776
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
You know how like almost

777
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
You don't know the

778
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,552
It's cuz you don't watch the actual full videos

779
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
But Kerry always has Tech troubles

780
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,976
Like there's always long periods where they can't hear each other and they're working out their Skype

781
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
Mute your mic

782
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,864
When I'm talkin releases them

783
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,704
So in this case because she couldn't get the

784
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,544
Lost in a year-and-a-half

785
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,360
Episode

786
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
I don't know why but maybe because she couldn't use YouTube

787
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,456
And she was using Facebook

788
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
She could get the picture in a picture going

789
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
Sew-ins

790
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
She has a laptop that she's holding up

791
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:02,720
Clarksville

792
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,864
This is my favorite thing that ever happened

793
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
F******

794
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
Beth

795
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:18,080
Enterprise six-year-old that's what a six-year-old would do

796
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
A six-year-old

797
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
Like not a six-year-old now they're far

798
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:28,064
I don't I don't like I don't like you impugning her for that because I think in a pinch

799
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,856
That's a pretty creative solution

800
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
It looks bad

801
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,744
Do it as opposed to like

802
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,328
We're going live but my laptop over here with the picture

803
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
She is for party

804
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,056
There might be a staying at some point

805
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
He will or something

806
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,175
But if you're holding if you're holding it with your with your little

807
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
Your little man

808
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,759
I believe that both happen

809
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
Difficulties and it's because you being attacked

810
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
She's being hacked of attack

811
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,183
YouTube D. Brett Stewart

812
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Clearly plagiarized this based on the evidence they presented obvious fact that other video came out a year before

813
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
Is remote viewing

814
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
And has

815
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Certain

816
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
Hematic and

817
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
Verbal

818
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
Literal verbal similarities

819
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,871
Turns of phrase uses of

820
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
Viewed video

821
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,991
Go to remote view the video you days before the

822
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,599
Could be its original material

823
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,671
It's him it's only that he couldn't

824
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Until after the

825
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Z play Droid

826
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Obviously

827
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Yes

828
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,263
The nakiri says

829
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
And he's a fan

830
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,687
Well in the past

831
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
Went off the rails

832
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
Friend if I weren't calling him out for

833
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,975
But the implication of this video existed a year before

834
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
Very

835
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,815
Clearly is instead of remote viewing what Brett

836
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,167
This video

837
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,751
That is the importation I mean

838
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Light.

839
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
It looks bad

840
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
All this looks bad

841
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:33,247
Is there a but I feel like there is that sap.

842
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
Brett should not

843
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Ifucking talked about the Manta

844
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
That's a good point Uruguay

845
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Yes

846
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,655
I guess you didn't hear that

847
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,703
What he said is

848
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:59,103
This isn't the actual drawing I've drawn a drawing of the one that's in his video

849
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:06,015
I don't know if I understand correctly what is happening in the video

850
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Yeah

851
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
Looking at camera

852
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
Hahaha Simon

853
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
In the laptop

854
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
Looking at camera

855
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Simon

856
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,535
Holding up a dry death

857
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,607
And it's a drawing of a drawing

858
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
This is Phantom

859
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
This is an Ouroboros of lunacy

860
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
What I saw

861
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,127
Just use the word mantis

862
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
She look like

863
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
His mother Drive

864
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
The Mantis

865
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,511
This is cold by the United States

866
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Hello

867
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,607
No

868
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,447
They're very

869
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
If I do not like Mike

870
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,543
Conspiracy alien b*******

871
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
To split hairs

872
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:07,967
I don't like it I like it

873
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,807
Jordans

874
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:17,695
Last episode Obama told us it's time to put away childish things

875
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:23,071
You have apologized

876
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
You're right.

877
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:28,703
So it's not mantises

878
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
Which caused everything in

879
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,311
Absolutely

880
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
How can you trust this man

881
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,687
Yeah and so he believes

882
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
It look dude

883
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
Does he goes on for

884
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
Forever about this

885
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,063
It just you know like

886
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,855
You know that

887
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,463
What what who are the mantises good or bad are the insectoids good or bad

888
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,583
Are the insectoids more of his insect or insect more of a general term

889
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,679
Are we talkin like kingdom phylum kind of s*** there's a there's no

890
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,543
We're going to eat all of it don't worry about it you're getting ahead of the horse

891
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
I just have question

892
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,895
I understand these questions with but like

893
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,735
I don't know I don't know what to say without giving it stuff away but

894
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
It's it's

895
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:18,367
Hugo's on

896
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:23,487
Not all mantises are not all insects

897
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:29,887
Right I don't know if that's the case

898
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
Whatever spelled out

899
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
Like that

900
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
So I don't know

901
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,543
And I'm not one to make assumptions about

902
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,359
Alien phylums and race

903
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
But we don't have the reefs

904
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
Something happened on this episode

905
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
That's straight-up

906
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Blue my mind

907
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
Yes

908
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:52,159
It's taken us awhile in heaven Carey have bulshit said to her

909
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,951
The cheese has been like oh yes

910
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
Finally

911
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
We get one

912
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
We're Cary

913
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,863
I don't know about that I don't know about that all right

914
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,655
I myself

915
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
Outside

916
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,591
That doesn't mean the whole thing is

917
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,919
It just means that there may be some issues there

918
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
I mean it

919
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
It's jarring

920
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
For her to have a problem with man

921
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
I don't know how I feel

922
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:27,231
I don't know how I feel about the skating is a little bit like

923
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,583
If your book is not gospel

924
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
None of that book is Gospel

925
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,679
If you're in for a penny in for a pound

926
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Conserve website

927
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,495
If you sort of elaborate con app

928
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,567
So you asked about the mantid agenda and I'm sorry I couldn't

929
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Answer your question

930
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
But here I believe it's about adopt

931
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
Yeah

932
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,807
International adoption

933
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:57,695
There in 300,000 kids who are in The Orphanage system

934
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
I'm fine with Manta.

935
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
I think we need

936
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
We need good homes

937
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
For all of these children

938
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,911
Regardless of your

939
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,239
Toy sexually part of The Magnificat

940
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,823
Can a mantis kind of dark

941
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Look man

942
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Imagine

943
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:24,063
Do you know how Mark Richards says the Raptors are cool and that makes us suspicious of him right and the Raptors

944
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:27,391
Makes it seem like a cool

945
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
The pretty cool too

946
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
So in terms of

947
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,095
To wrap up this man to the agenda

948
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Could you

949
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Understanding

950
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
Tell me what you think the mantid agenda is it

951
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
And

952
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,719
And then we'll move on to

953
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
What insect

954
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
It's actually one

955
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Ximena teachers

956
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
Reptilians

957
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
Which actually wants Humanity

958
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
I'm held

959
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Slave

960
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
Malachichi

961
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
Realtree

962
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,647
Come from this Earth

963
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,207
Save-A-Lot

964
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,999
Ashley

965
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Something like that

966
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
When they first it sold

967
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,935
But that the Cretaceous

968
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,495
Humanity

969
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
Presentation

970
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Involves

971
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,175
Goes to the 5th Dimension

972
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
So will I

973
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
Now that's cool

974
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
Before

975
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
Restocking

976
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Reason

977
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
Comenity V

978
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,047
They do not win

979
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
If we're stuck in

980
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,631
Minnesota

981
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:18,239
That's a good point about how

982
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
Align

983
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
How can you not trust them

984
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,359
So you're asking about the dimensions

985
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:29,759
And this is this is a part of illuminati Theory that's been going on for a really long time at 8

986
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,695
If you reach another a new denture

987
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Do you like

988
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:44,095
Today you become a lot about people who don't understand

989
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:49,215
Years ago

990
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,079
From this idea that of the Illuminati

991
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
What day are is the Alexa

992
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
The Darkside

993
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,967
Of whatever it is

994
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
There's a there's a

995
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
How many points

996
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,087
And every time there's something that happened

997
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,391
People online

998
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Get boners

999
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,255
About how this is at like 2012 was that for a long time

1000
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,351
It's whatever coming point there is is that is the point

1001
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,143
When we will either

1002
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Ascend

1003
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
To the next level

1004
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
Stay

1005
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
The Third

1006
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,055
Or 4th Dimension

1007
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Depending on

1008
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
Definition

1009
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:34,271
Makes as little sense as anything essentially is that

1010
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
Life

1011
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,623
And your time in this density or this dimension

1012
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Is 2

1013
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
Teach you certain lessons

1014
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,487
And get you to elevate to the neck

1015
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Next level

1016
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
Specifically

1017
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
In the context of putting yourself

1018
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
Before or putting

1019
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
Others before your

1020
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,983
A Brief History of Time

1021
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
That was Hawking

1022
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Main Theatre

1023
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
Weather

1024
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,127
Your snickering

1025
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:08,063
How far back does it go

1026
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,855
It goes at least a Carl Sagan

1027
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,135
Demon Haunted World

1028
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
But those about the

1029
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,303
Look dude I don't even know how to spell it out but the point is

1030
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,119
There's this belief that we are faced with crisis

1031
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
It's coming

1032
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,959
And get ourselves

1033
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
Elevated

1034
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,055
So it's all the same talk raise your vibration

1035
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,663
Elevate to the next level as opposed to getting left here

1036
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
Yeah the mantises

1037
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Semantics

1038
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,295
There are boys

1039
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
Come along with us

1040
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,975
Whatever we go because they're probably because they're 144 million years they came up with

1041
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,303
That's or whatever left I don't know why not

1042
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
They're not busy

1043
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Yeah

1044
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Now

1045
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
This man

1046
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
Be stupid

1047
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,823
On my part

1048
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
I would save it if

1049
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,639
Mantids

1050
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,943
And I know I saw the drawing that he made

1051
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
They look like bugs

1052
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,831
Exactly

1053
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:34,591
Betty Boop

1054
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,271
Consciousness

1055
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
So

1056
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:48,159
Difficult for me to imagine that 144 million years ago

1057
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
So

1058
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
There were Manta

1059
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
It would have taken

1060
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
Them millions of years

1061
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,631
To evolve into the form of mantis

1062
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
That would be able to

1063
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:03,263
Sprout was an oxygen-rich

1064
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,127
Environment at that that's why everybody grew so much

1065
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,247
Of any other

1066
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,319
Earthbound episode of

1067
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,391
Coming close to space technology race

1068
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:26,047
Animal

1069
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:35,007
We all know that was Patricia

1070
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:42,687
IFixit mantises based on their arm

1071
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Being

1072
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:51,391
Not cleaning up the Earth and leaving behind no

1073
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
Sign of them being here

1074
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
They got those

1075
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
You're not wrong

1076
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:01,119
They got wrong mantis beings are also somehow wrapped up

1077
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
Into the hollow Earth stuff

1078
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:09,055
So there might be honest to Earth I figured there might be some of that rap

1079
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
Wrapped up in there

1080
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,615
Sure

1081
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,151
All the stuff is stupid

1082
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
But

1083
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
I'm thrilled their honor

1084
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,503
What I what I always

1085
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,039
About all of these

1086
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,391
Is that

1087
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,439
Fundamental concepts that I think

1088
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
Everything

1089
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,535
Every religion every belief system

1090
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Is

1091
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
Obsessed

1092
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,375
Which is the idea of

1093
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Ascension verse

1094
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:41,055
The slavery thing to me that regardless of what it is you believe

1095
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,615
Everybody has a general core

1096
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
AAA

1097
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Concept

1098
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Of

1099
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Weird

1100
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
Currently

1101
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
It is medium level

1102
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,831
Yeah we're in the muck that we could be worse

1103
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,695
We could be better

1104
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Fascinating

1105
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,559
Even more fascinating when you put it that way

1106
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,351
It becomes really troubling that like

1107
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,911
A lot of especially

1108
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,447
Western Oregon

1109
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
And a religion

1110
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
The

1111
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
Good ending

1112
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:16,383
You know like if you play the game right you get the good good video game end

1113
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,431
That ending is

1114
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,991
Your individuality is absorbed in

1115
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
To like

1116
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:28,415
God or those who worship

1117
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
Completely gone

1118
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
If you succeed

1119
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,023
Yeah whatever that that to me is

1120
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,071
How to be a kind of weird

1121
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,351
I don't like that

1122
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,191
I like my individuality

1123
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
I like my autonomy

1124
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
You know I'm kind of into it

1125
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:49,407
Well but don't you feel like maybe maybe there could be

1126
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,271
Ultimately so many of your problems are baked

1127
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,087
In the fact that you

1128
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,391
Have have complete autonomy

1129
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,207
Like you don't know my problem

1130
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,255
I apologize

1131
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,071
Even though we talked about your problems for countless

1132
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,399
I like bad pictures

1133
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
Grace

1134
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,591
It is kind of interesting

1135
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
How

1136
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
We all

1137
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
Regardless of

1138
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
Where your beliefs

1139
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
All have this yearning

1140
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
4

1141
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
Better

1142
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:32,159
Overriding that is our fear of

1143
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,255
Yeah like ultimately that that risk

1144
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Aversion

1145
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,071
That everybody has you know

1146
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:43,935
We would rather you would rather avoid losing $5

1147
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Then went and

1148
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,775
Like it's it's a really interesting thing to

1149
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,335
Recordings are wired

1150
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
So much of this comes from

1151
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,455
Just this evolutionary need to tunak

1152
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:01,087
Get f***** 1800 in that is that all of these even if you go this crazy

1153
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
Senor Taco

1154
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,927
Or you go Christianity

1155
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
Steven other religion

1156
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
Earthbound religion

1157
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,655
Bright you don't cross the game

1158
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,751
One of the connective tissues and one of the threads are almost all of it is

1159
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
This

1160
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,055
Is meat

1161
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,871
Like this flash body

1162
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,919
Inconsequential and doesn't matter

1163
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,455
It seems like that is

1164
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
The through line through every

1165
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,503
Like this

1166
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
That's the prison

1167
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,319
The prison is The Flash

1168
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Nothing

1169
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,695
That goes there old-time picnic gnostic

1170
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
Like all of it

1171
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,279
Every single but you have to do that

1172
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Because

1173
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,119
Visceral impulses are really powerful

1174
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,191
Yeah if you want to get people to fall into your line of thinking

1175
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
You have to convince them

1176
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,639
Absolutely

1177
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,431
It is it is the

1178
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,455
Through-line

1179
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,295
Into all of these religions that ultimately invalidates all of them

1180
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:08,159
Yeah if you believe in Christianity your end

1181
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
Cool

1182
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:13,279
Is the exact same as the guy who believes in Manton

1183
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
Yeah it doesn't

1184
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,095
Matter

1185
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,143
There is a fundamental conflict

1186
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Between

1187
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,471
Consciousness and insta

1188
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,007
And we're not

1189
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
Capable of proper

1190
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
That may be the case

1191
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
Still not hanging out with

1192
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
No

1193
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,503
I would love to

1194
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,879
Drive on the wrong side of the road

1195
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,439
Cuz he is

1196
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:47,071
Real crazy that's a bunch of stuff

1197
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,935
That's the right side of the road

1198
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
I caught a bunch of

1199
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
This stuff

1200
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,055
Politics a bunch and

1201
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
Simon

1202
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Knows a lot

1203
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
What are his political beliefs

1204
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,015
He believes that the Syrian stuff was a false flag

1205
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:11,135
That's not great but I only bring that up it's really it's really boring

1206
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
But I bring it up because

1207
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
Is Daigo this is

1208
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
The same as Alice

1209
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,071
I think a lot of people who listen

1210
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,167
Not a lot of people but I'm sure there's a small minority at least

1211
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
It's like why do you cover Project Camelot

1212
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
El because

1213
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,031
You got to recognize that

1214
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Lot of the time

1215
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
Believe the same thing it's just

1216
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,919
Terry talks about this

1217
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,199
Other man testing

1218
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
Mark Richard

1219
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:42,367
Ultimately we get to the same conclusion right on these guys

1220
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,391
So despite

1221
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,183
Syria gas

1222
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Supposed to

1223
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,255
Stop also I don't think anybody is at this

1224
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Why do you cough

1225
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:55,423
Right now I asking my head though

1226
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:00,031
Not everyone's asking baby like I do I do feel it like it's weird

1227
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,079
It's weird that we're in Alex Jones podcast

1228
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,383
For some reason we just f****** talk about

1229
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,527
Look what we could talk about megachurches

1230
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Walking shitted mantids

1231
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,119
They also talked about

1232
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,983
Just that there's a bunch of like Russia

1233
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,775
There's pro-putin leanings

1234
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,127
Even though Simon has come out and said that the nordics are advising Putin

1235
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,247
He's still he's saying things and negative about Putin

1236
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,039
But based on reality

1237
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,831
Is it you're letting him off the hook

1238
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:49,183
4 things you know like the reason that the Holocaust

1239
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,719
It wasn't it wasn't

1240
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
Nationalist German

1241
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Is Nordic

1242
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,351
Integrate

1243
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,911
Mercenaries

1244
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,031
Did particular things they talk about is the gas

1245
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
Sing of that spy

1246
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
And London

1247
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,223
And it's another

1248
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,247
But it wasn't Putin

1249
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,319
You wouldn't have done something like that blah blah I was great

1250
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,719
Mayonnaise sure fit in with everything Putin's ever done though perfectly

1251
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,095
Exactly

1252
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
It's 2

1253
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,079
Until they gas people in order to make it look like him

1254
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
I don't like the idea of States being copycat killers

1255
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
That doesn't that doesn't music

1256
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
The other thing

1257
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:54,975
The other thing that I forgot to bring up is in the conversation of the Syria being a false flag

1258
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,839
What they were getting to at the end was that

1259
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,119
The

1260
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,143
Kabbalah

1261
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:06,239
Cabal the Zionist cabal and Israel

1262
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
Find it so

1263
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,799
There is a table

1264
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:09,823
Comes back to an

1265
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,991
But here's the problem is like yeah Israel's doing a lot of fuckedupshit but the world

1266
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,207
Conspiracy theories and then throw Israel in it

1267
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,999
Guess that you have a different

1268
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,583
Angela

1269
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,167
And I don't think is real

1270
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,495
Because they're run by the goddamn reptile

1271
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,287
Take me to bring in the Raptors

1272
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,079
So it's just weird

1273
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,383
I'm sorry there's been a lot of talking

1274
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
But it gets too

1275
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
Probably my favorite thing

1276
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Project Camelot

1277
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,759
There is a

1278
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
F******

1279
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
This is

1280
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
So weird

1281
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,391
I don't even know how to set this up and there's no f******

1282
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
You to just enjoy the show

1283
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
President-trump

1284
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
President-trump

1285
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
He's talking about

1286
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
In South Korea

1287
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,823
Is that you saying that Trump finally put pressure on and that's why

1288
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
It's not important what happens if

1289
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Just wanted to give you

1290
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,247
Pieces

1291
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,295
China and Russia

1292
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
Set to Meraki

1293
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,367
Go ahead and do it

1294
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
Change face

1295
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,231
Was because

1296
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
North Korea has

1297
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
Nucleus

1298
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
And a missile

1299
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,143
Could reach

1300
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
Real estate

1301
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
David China

1302
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:44,799
The first time

1303
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
Yes

1304
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,127
North Korea

1305
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,991
And the Rothschild

1306
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Financially control

1307
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
It's cool

1308
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
So

1309
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,791
Do we have with Carrie

1310
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,327
Got a lot of coffee

1311
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:13,215
And then we have the Rothschilds and Rockefellers

1312
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,823
Just one control the North and one

1313
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
Control the South

1314
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,687
Is the proxy war between the Rockefellers

1315
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:27,039
Is caught back in the 2009 era of where Alex Jones is

1316
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,063
Conspiracy mindset

1317
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,903
I think I have her carry talk about Soros

1318
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,975
Right but this guy isn't

1319
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,511
Simon's not bring him up

1320
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
But

1321
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
We should see

1322
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
Again another parallel

1323
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:44,191
There to those two World bring up the Rockefellers in the Rothschild

1324
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
Has big villains

1325
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,615
General operating Theory now on North Korea is that

1326
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,687
They realize that

1327
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,479
Their nuclear program was

1328
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:04,671
Read about the whole situation

1329
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,951
The the

1330
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:11,839
Nuclear testing site that they have that was a underground or whatever

1331
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:16,191
Collapsed

1332
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,751
I'm fairly certain at this point they're kind of like

1333
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:23,103
They figured it out

1334
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,919
Possibility

1335
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,735
Another possibility is that negotiations

1336
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,271
Dawn understood of like

1337
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,855
Text like the idea that he's offering

1338
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,391
Some sort of denuclearization

1339
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,439
If you look at his statement

1340
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
They do

1341
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,791
To imply that we have to also

1342
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,607
Like expectation is like we have agreement

1343
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,887
But everyone

1344
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,983
Gets rid of nuke actually a good negotiating position

1345
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:55,871
I like that the problem is I'm kind of on the side now of

1346
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,663
Everybody should have nukes

1347
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:01,503
Like realistically what America and Russia should do

1348
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:05,343
Is give our nuclear stockpile

1349
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,487
Invading Iran Iran

1350
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:15,071
We've got ten now distribution

1351
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
Of mutually assured

1352
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Jordan

1353
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
Now

1354
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:23,007
Jordans

1355
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,871
Let me introduce you to my dear friend Ollie North the new head of the NRA

1356
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,991
I think I think you two now have a lot in common cuz you have just described their position I'm going right

1357
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,415
Gun rights are slightly different

1358
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,719
Insofar as

1359
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:46,303
Oh didn't tell me tell me how this is an equal position

1360
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
What do you mean

1361
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:54,495
I mean a comparable in order so no one can aggressive on each other

1362
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,311
Everyone has gone so no one can be violent with each other

1363
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:02,943
Same thing on a macro scale proscale

1364
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
Situation

1365
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:10,111
Ridiculous

1366
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,791
Everything

1367
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:22,911
Everything alright

1368
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,727
I don't like that

1369
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,519
Cuz that is a false

1370
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,823
No it's not entirely

1371
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895
Because killing is killing

1372
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,663
No

1373
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,943
I understand killing Eve

1374
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
I get that

1375
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,295
But what what are you what are you talkin about

1376
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,367
The threat at its core is

1377
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,183
Whether it's master

1378
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Your death

1379
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,279
Norton massively preferred

1380
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
Nobody had nukes

1381
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,143
Don't don't disagree don't don't misunderstand my position

1382
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,751
Addition is no guns

1383
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:05,151
No f****** I never one position

1384
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:12,063
Massively nuclear powers are a capable of threatening everybody else

1385
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,463
At this point in time f****** International concept the only way to avoid being

1386
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
It's too hot

1387
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:26,911
But you look at the you you look at the Sons of Guns

1388
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
Gangs and cops

1389
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,519
How you going to protect yourself from both of those got to have a gun

1390
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,079
It's not a good metaphor

1391
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:37,407
Who cares not right

1392
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
Agree to disagree

1393
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Sue

1394
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
Remember how Carrie was coughing

1395
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,343
She was

1396
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Actually it doesn't

1397
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
Stop she does she runs around in circles

1398
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,975
Raditz Arcos Ryan Circle

1399
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,071
Sorry sorry it's not

1400
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,823
Anyway

1401
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
So

1402
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Sure

1403
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
Sure

1404
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,855
Energy

1405
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
Thanks Simon

1406
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
I could just have

1407
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
A dry throat

1408
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
That's what you think

1409
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
Wait she's going to jump back

1410
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
Wait no wait no

1411
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,143
I don't know you know how much you

1412
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
Pay attention

1413
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
Hear anything about my work

1414
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,727
Fat Joe

1415
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,055
Recently Mark Richards actually leaked

1416
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,103
Something that was very very interest

1417
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
It is about

1418
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,479
North Korea and maybe this is why

1419
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
What's happening

1420
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,319
Attack attack

1421
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,391
My throat chakra is being used

1422
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
Protect yourself now

1423
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
Anthony

1424
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,423
And this visitor is gone.

1425
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,959
It is just go to stop

1426
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,007
Okay thank you

1427
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
Wow

1428
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Wow

1429
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,615
Wow

1430
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
Hi I just got taken back

1431
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,455
I just got taken back

1432
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
To when I was

1433
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
When I was growing up

1434
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,551
My mom

1435
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
Was

1436
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
Really really sick one

1437
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
In the middle of the night

1438
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
Uso

1439
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Sac-like

1440
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
Screaming out

1441
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,535
In pain woke up the whole family

1442
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
Even in the base

1443
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,351
And we're all just running

1444
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Into the

1445
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,143
Into my parents badge

1446
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
And we're like

1447
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
For real

1448
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
What's what the f*** is going on

1449
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
And my dad's like

1450
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,103
Fine I'm laying hands on her and pray

1451
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,127
School

1452
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:52,063
Immediately Hands-On bulshit

1453
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:58,463
911 please

1454
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
You energy

1455
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
There's a lot of love

1456
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,559
To protect you against the state Anna kenergy

1457
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
The f*** off

1458
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,911
She coughs later

1459
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:12,031
And I didn't take a drink of water but not on camera

1460
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,055
Right now

1461
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,359
Information of a bottle and anyway

1462
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,895
But I just love

1463
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
I love the idea that you thought that she was

1464
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:27,647
Dismissive of his idea that it's an energy

1465
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,463
We're talking about Kerry Cassidy

1466
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,255
Really I was really hoping

1467
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
No such luck

1468
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,447
No such luck

1469
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,471
Stop just like

1470
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,287
Pretty close to molarities between

1471
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,311
Simon

1472
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,127
Project Camelot and Alex

1473
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,431
In its first money talks about brexit

1474
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
One of the primary race

1475
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
Great Britain

1476
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,831
The European Union

1477
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,671
Night of the 9th Premiere television

1478
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,767
Thousand people screaming across borders

1479
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,751
If you take a comfy

1480
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
And you

1481
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,311
Try to change

1482
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,151
By introducing

1483
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
Riots

1484
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Revolution

1485
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,343
And I believe he meant the cases.

1486
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,231
So cultural replace

1487
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,791
Is behind the fears

1488
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,607
And they are doing that intentionally

1489
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
That's exactly what Alex says

1490
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:49,567
Yeah that's a hundred percent is whole idea about the globalist and how they're trying to have no borders

1491
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:54,943
Enchiladas with cultures

1492
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
That's

1493
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
Really

1494
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,551
Ridiculous

1495
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:06,463
Predict whether his assessment is accurate and it want to talk about that

1496
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,863
What he was saying is that propaganda made people afraid about cultural displacement is effect

1497
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,679
I'll agree with that

1498
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:19,007
He was he was so he was at my

1499
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
Amanda Cerny

1500
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
Consent if he is dead

1501
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,919
Cambridge analytica instead of raptors I've been like

1502
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,711
You're pretty

1503
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,015
Close to me

1504
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,319
Whatever

1505
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:38,463
This is just so they're not the one

1506
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,791
This is just about the Rothschilds in the Rockefeller

1507
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
The human

1508
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
As it were

1509
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,007
There's no doubt about that

1510
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,567
Has been really

1511
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,103
Talkin about a lot

1512
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,639
Is 5G Tech

1513
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
Technology

1514
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,711
Right then I really understand that

1515
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,479
Vegeta stance

1516
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,247
Regeneration

1517
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,295
And knives

1518
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,855
Jean this bunch of times in terms of upgrades

1519
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
Technology is it where

1520
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,927
Frabill to heaven

1521
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:12,255
Every time there's been a lunatic fringe groups

1522
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,279
That I've been like

1523
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,887
Fight The Future

1524
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,447
Having access to the internet

1525
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
And so

1526
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
That's why we should

1527
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,591
Deregulate

1528
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
What

1529
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:36,063
And turns out Simon

1530
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Little different

1531
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
Richard Stokes

1532
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
Faction

1533
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
Attempting

1534
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,071
5G

1535
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,631
G5

1536
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,679
Wichita

1537
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215
Wi-Fi

1538
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,263
What's the weather

1539
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
Affects humans

1540
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,407
I'm going to try to

1541
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
Mac strain

1542
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,479
Wife of brain control

1543
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
Large numbers

1544
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,295
The reason that

1545
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,111
Not which is probably not allowed to have public

1546
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,927
It's because there is as we speak

1547
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:14,975
Between

1548
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,511
The cabal group

1549
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
What is the outcome

1550
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
Sup

1551
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,423
Could be the real

1552
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,751
A fourth-dimensional enter

1553
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
5G

1554
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,431
And then and then

1555
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,479
Classic conman move

1556
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,527
This is something you

1557
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,879
So I'm going to rename it into something that I only understand

1558
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,159
It's G5

1559
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,695
You don't like that kind of

1560
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,791
Always always always

1561
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,815
Childish

1562
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
That's what it is

1563
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,375
1/2 what it is

1564
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,959
Yeah I only played that clip

1565
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:00,287
And play the last two to specifically point out that like there's

1566
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
Be mad at correlation

1567
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
Dream

1568
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
The things that they're afraid of

1569
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:07,711
In Project Camelot world

1570
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,063
More less Neighbors

1571
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,367
So the other thing

1572
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
What is that

1573
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
Last month

1574
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695

Of some sort

1580
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,727
And he got into a little bit of a

1581
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,495
We couldn't

1582
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,519
Never get a radio

Or whatever like they still wouldn't allow

1596
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,007

1651
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
He fixes demonic possession

1652
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,567
You could call a lot of my mental illness

1653
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,152

Be free of such entities Simon

1660
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,280
To bring this

1661
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
In the meantime

1662
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,192
Abused wanted to hang out

1663
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,752

He does all this for over Skype or over the phone for $100

1666
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:49,920
An hour which

1667
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
100 lb

1668
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:56,320

1669
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088

1670
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,672

01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:06,816
Anyway what's the average

1673
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:10,144
Like talk therapy, whatever is

1674
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,424
Talk-space that's it

1675
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
I'm sure the rates on that are

1676
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:20,128
What Siri

1677
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,248
I'll tell you that right now

1678
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,552
I don't think I would take a talk to me that either

1679
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,112
I think they're probably

1680
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
Borderline

1681
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,184
50/50

1682
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,464
But I am driving

1683
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,048
I've one last clip this is the

1684
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
The punchline

1685
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:40,864
Boy

1686
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
Boy howdy

1687
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,704
Richard's wife

1688
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,496
And as far as I'm

1689
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
He should not be

1690
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,248
Batiste

1691
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,784
Immediately

1692
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,320
No know he was involved in

1693
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:04,160
Murder

1694
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,720
I believe that Joanne Richards

1695
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Genuine

1696
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,048
That's not what I've ever taken issue with

1697
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,328
I've taken issue with the fact that

1698
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
Tucci's

1699
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
Being

1700
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,752
Defrauded is actively participating

1701
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:24,384
Serial killers wind up getting like a

1702
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:30,016
Let love letters in naked pictures from random ads women

1703
