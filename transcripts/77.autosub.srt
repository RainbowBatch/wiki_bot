00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
Just for one though

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,344
Question

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,904
The follow-up I'll allow it

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672

All right there we go

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,848
What was your fault though that was the follow-up that my

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,688
Have to bring it up guys

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,272
I wanted to bring this up and I didn't tell you before we started recording cuz I think

16
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
It's fun and I don't do stand-up anymore

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
Make a note

18
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,280
Reservation

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
White people

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
It buzzes your your little

21
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
So whenever I get up to

22
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
Text like you when you texted me

23
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
I got a little buzz

24
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
But it also doesn't

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
If you haven't moved in a while

26
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,488
Like an electric shock

27
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
And it work

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
That just has like

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Do you want have a cigarette

30
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,192
Remind me to go take

31
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
Fake cigarette break

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
Let's go in my lungs but helping my legs

33
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Compromise we all got them

34
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
Right

35
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Just be lung cancer

36
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Indeed

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,024
Is alright

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Bi-fold of the policy wonk

39
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Thank you for joining up

40
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
That was our Make-a-Wish wasn't it

41
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,360
That's exactly what just happened right now

42
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
Also I need to do this

43
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
Because I think I falling behind it

44
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Terms of our foreign policy wonk

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
We have a couple in the last week

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
And I think I might have

47
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Given one

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,440

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Thank you very much

52
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Now that I'm doing this

53
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
I think I've done this all already

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm still up in my head that I can't remember

55
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
I also

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
A foreign policy

57
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Stop

58
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,536
Alright

00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
But I want to make sure that we got everybody covered

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
I'm not good at monitoring my email

62
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Like I don't know why I'm included but it's like

63
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,456
Reminder if you if you up your donation we will give you another uniform

64
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
I don't want to be one of these guys

65
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Become a foreign policy wonk

66
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
And the people come through

67
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
And I just forget

68
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
One of those guys one of those guys

69
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,960
So many kickstarter's

70
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
You can see the guys

71
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
He said listen

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
You're going to be a foreign policy want but

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
They never fall off

74
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:04,224
There's so many people who do Kickstarter

75
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
And stuff like that

76
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Just lying and cheating people

77
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
Is definitely

78
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,399
Hallmark of capital steaks are real low for your most

79
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
People's creative Kickstarter

80
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,031
Those are like to give a shout out to

81
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
Set me a nice email I really appreciate it

82
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Informed us that to Alex Jones

83
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Is wrong

84
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
About Sweden

85
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,783
Which we already

86
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,903
We could have guessed that but I have always wanted to marry a woman

87
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Until

88
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
Almost is coming off as a cliche

89
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
No she's real she's real.

90
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
Look up women named Sonia

91
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,007
Mortal Kombat

92
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
Right us I'm convinced

93
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
I just

94
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Don't really give a sheet

95
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,047
Twitter Bots got 2000 hundred

96
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
In my life where maybe I'm an old man

97
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
I know that the the rest

98
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Wrestling fans of the world

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Don't like Johnson

100
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Cuz he wins all the time

101
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
I don't care

102
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Cuz I get to hear his theme song

103
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
If you win

104
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
What's his stats

105
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Exactly

106
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
Corn

107
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
Blaze episode

108
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
Still doing preamble

109
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,351
Everybody's already stop listening by about the World At Large

110
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
One main thing

111
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
I'm starting to become

112
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Incredibly

113
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Concerned

114
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
About

115
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Joe Rogan

116
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
This is something that our friend far-out friend of

117
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,175
The show has a while back

118
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
But

119
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
His most recent Gap

120
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
I was Peter Schiff

121
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Who's someone who

122
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
About on the Shelf

123
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
He's one of Alex Jones's favorite economist

124
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
Went on Joe Rogan show and I listen to the first like

125
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
2 hours of it

126
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
Just talkin all this b*******

127
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
About how he moved his business

128
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
To Puerto Rico to avoid federal tax

129
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Believe that

130
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
The minimum wage should be nothing

131
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
Because if you don't have the skills to earn a high wages

132
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
It's your fault

133
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
It's all these ideas

134
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Children should work in Coal Mine

135
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Course they can learn skills

136
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
Cuz their children they don't have to

137
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
It's about exposure

138
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,119
Aldi's

139
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,959
Libertarianism and I don't know what Joe Rogan

140
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Cuz he's had a

141
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Ring

142
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,639
Of these alt-right libertarian ding dong

143
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
Mixed in with you know you're

144
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
Your Joey Diaz is in

145
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,087
The standard SP has

146
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Because

147
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Was not challenging

148
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
Peter schiff's ideas at all

149
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
I was just

150
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
Signing off on them all that makes sense

151
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Why does no one talk about this

152
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Wow

153
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,471
A lot of people do it your new fan base is going to

154
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Quite a bit

155
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
You know it's weird

156
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
I was watching

157
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
The livestream

158
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
Put some super male Vitality on a burger and just ate it

159
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
During Peter Schiff

160
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Might as well

161
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
Yeah you might as well

162
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
He seems

163
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
Smarter and yells last

164
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
But he's becoming Alex Jones

165
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,399
You think so wow

166
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
Did that is something that I would send Joe have in common

167
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
That could be

168
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Humping the wall

169
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Pretentious

170
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
What do you think Tom Brady

171
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Chop chop.

172
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Your argument would be

173
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
The entire NFL basically

174
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Sports

175
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Not allowed time to gets back

176
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Therefore he is safe

177
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
From the CTE

178
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Anyway

179
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,079
Anyway my point that they wanted to make is I'm deeply concerned about this growing in

180
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
Spreading disease

181
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
Really worried that

182
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
Joseph

183
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Incredibly impression

184
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
They look up to him as a icon

185
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
If it's a way that I looked up to Adam

186
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
When I was in

187
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Junior High

188
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
High school you know

189
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,743
I'm concerned about them being

190
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
Exposed to Peter Schiff

191
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Talkin his ass off

192
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
For 2 hours

193
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
More or less unchallenged by Rogan

194
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Or at least when he challenges him

195
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Really

196
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
It's soft

197
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
It's really kid gloves

198
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Movie kind of stuff

199
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Heavy never even get to the park

200
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
Or really discuss the fact

201
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
That

202
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,503
Peter Schiff believe that taxation is a crime

203
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Against people

204
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,879
Does he lives in Puerto Rico

205
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Alright well then we should

206
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
Allow him to have roads

207
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Where

208
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
All the stuff

209
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
That's what I if you don't want to pay federal income tax

210
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
That is fine I reckon

211
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Decision

212
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,847
Anyway I'm pissed off whatever

213
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
I will deal with it in my own way

214
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Probably

215
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,551
Drinking tons of is black raspberry sparkling water you brought over

216
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
!

217
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
It's like a it's a

218
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:11,583
Like the Steven Soderbergh movie The End

219
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
At the Disco

220
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
Discussing the August 23rd 2017 episode of The Alex Jones Show

221
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
That was Wednesday of this week

222
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
We are

223
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,551
Can I call an audible during the show is that possible

224
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
The rest of the night for us

225
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,183
Call inaudible roughly 15

226
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
18 seconds I can probably

227
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
For about 4

228
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,071
6 hours

229
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Directions

230
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,679
The present

231
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
Dad visit episode stocks on a number of levels

232
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
At least

233
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Three or four moments

234
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
No one

235
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
I Really Deserve Summit a

236
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
And unfortunately we're probably going to have

237
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
Talk for a minute about Joe Arpaio

238
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
But we'll keep it to a minimum

239
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Alex Jones

240
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
Alzheimer's

241
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Digress

242
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
Brought an idiot

243
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
What video

244
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
Going to use that that was in reference at Morehouse

245
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
Did I hit a regular covers

246
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,063
Justine

247
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
That was a reference

248
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
To Trump

249
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
Speech that he gave him Phoenix

250
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,791
Trump has Alzheimer's

251
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
Who is Steve

252
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
Even though even like doing that f******

253
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,263
Broke at least three or four different

254
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
Like he had a public official audio

255
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
Thousand on the list

256
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Yeah well

257
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
I tried to stammer my way through that like I was Bob Newhart I f***** it up

258
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
So he talks a bit about

259
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
The speech

260
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
To start things off

261
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
Donald Trump

262
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,967
Incredibly riveting

263
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
I can't turn away

264
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
This is the Ultimate Reality Show

265
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
He's doing the best job in the economy around Santana stand expansion

266
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Automan

267
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,983
I watch live last night that our Plus

268
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,175
Volley after volley of Truth against watch them fly at at just

269
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,295
Before the speech in Phoenix

270
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
Everything they say about him is what they're doing

271
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,023
Was

272
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
Bikers rally against Trump

273
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
From 300 yards away of bikers

274
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
Bikers for Trump

275
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,175
And then it was but they wanted to make it look like everyone

276
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Going

277
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,343
Beyond any level of Lies the Soviet Union or anybody ever else North Korean propaganda has

278
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Nothing on this

279
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:52,511
You know when North Korea when they're like hey those bikers they don't like Kim Jeong Hoon

280
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
That's

281
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Stop believe from everything I can tell.

282
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Character

283
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Groups

284
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,503
Trump when they were for it was also in the context

285
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Is there being a lot of groups

286
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
That we're going to protest

287
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
And there were some that were coming to support

288
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
And so the article

289
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Itself

290
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
I had to do with both sides of the

291
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
The demonstration

292
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
Alex only reads headlines

293
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
The size of his rally wasn't equal to the size of the protester I don't care

294
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,175
Protesters wasn't equal in size of the Rat don't care

295
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Did you see me

296
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
His rally size

297
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Is 0

298
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
Guy who opposed

299
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
Every time there's been a rally you post that image

300
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Do the Cavaliers

301
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
Celebration

302
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Didn't realize

303
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,751
He presented as this be outside of the Trump rally

304
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
The Cleveland

305
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
Cavaliers NBA Finals celebration parade

306
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
Cubs

307
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
World Series champs

308
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
Yeah I got to read that

309
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
Apparently

310
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
For every rally

311
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
And conservative ding-dong

312
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Still don't catch on

313
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
Hilarious

314
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
I read an article about him

315
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
I'm just a sports guy if you look down my feed you can tell I'm f******

316
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
People

317
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
That's that's the only thing I care about

318
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Here's my question

319
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
U-Save the jury

320
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Are you still out on

321
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Because there was a little bit of a cut

322
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,135
There I don't know why it goes a little glitch in the recorder

323
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
With increasing the truth

324
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
The jury's still out on

325
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
Alex is married she doesn't spell it out on this episode

326
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
Narrative is the Trump is trolling people

327
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
By saying he's going to raise the troops levels

328
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
And then pull them all out

329
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
He's trying to

330
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Trickmaster

331
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Into a false sense of

332
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Security

333
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
And then he's going to pull the rug out from under his globalist

334
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Yeah so that's why the jury's out

335
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Hey by

336
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,439
Jerry not out

337
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
Really grasping at straws

338
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
Number two

339
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
I mean he knows that it's bad

340
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
That's what it really me

341
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,263
Alex knows that the idea of sending more troops to Afghanistan

342
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Is bad he can't

343
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,151
Support it cuz he has a long documented record of being against war in Afghanistan

344
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
Everything that the bushes clintons and Obama did

345
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
In terms of wars

346
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
He's going to be

347
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Very exposed

348
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
He's going to have to be against

349
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,231
Right and I don't think he's ready

350
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
The jump off that train yet

351
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,631
Lot of people keep saying you don't know how is Alex going to turn

352
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
And my response

353
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,287
No Dodgers

354
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,615
I don't think they're Rodger stones are real bellwether

355
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Especially when you see Rodger Stone

356
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Anyway

357
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Alex says that he's going to go over

358
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
All of the clips

359
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
From Trump

360
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
I'm assuming

361
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
He plays too

362
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
He plays one

363
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,679
How long was the rally 7077

364
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
Okay so

365
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
You might be right if you were saying sex

366
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,175
Replace one where he says of the media is really f****** awful

367
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,015
I'm in episode

368
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Any plate

369
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Yeah

370
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
Joe Arpaio is on

371
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,487
How is he not in prison you might have been Skyping in for prison

372
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
That's a better question but

373
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
Before he does the interview with Arpaio B play the clip where Trump is like

374
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Do you guys like Sheriff Joe

375
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
So you place those two clip

376
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,127
But he keeps saying I'm going to play all of them we're going to get into it I'm going to do some analysis of it but

377
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Secant

378
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
I think he's

379
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
He's drunk

380
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Oh

381
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,807
Alright Isaac H I think Alex

382
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Either drunk

383
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,879
Or in the middle of a manic episode

384
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Orbo

385
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
And I'm leaning towards bow

386
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
You'll see the behavior on this episode

387
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
Is quite different than usual

388
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Even for 2017

389
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
There is

390
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
So much ranting

391
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
So much losing track of where he is

392
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
And the way this episode

393
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
He's exactly like the March 30th

394
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
Episode where he was wasted off his ass

395
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
With the exception of

396
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
He doesn't have Rob do sitting next to him in a jacket waiting to leave

397
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
To the four ways to learn

398
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
At least

399
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
Alright but before we

400
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,439
Because it's a 3-hour show

401
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
The buzz is going to be different throughout

402
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
He's just good worked up drunk

403
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
As I I believe

404
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
You want to talk about the globalist

405
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Course

406
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Spiderlite

407
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,807
World weather creating a false reality

408
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,391
And then having

409
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Just going

410
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
In some groups for the week

411
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,151
Dumbest

412
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
The most helpless people

413
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,135
Presentation of the news

414
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
A good meeting with Alex

415
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
But I would like to say

416
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,863
That the exact same thing as being done by Trump with all of the box

417
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
There've been a couple of new studies that have come out following a lot of these thoughts

418
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
If you really look at it it's

419
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
It's pretty impressive

420
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Body clear Oregon

421
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,615
Innovation made the rounds

422
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Wanted

423
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
The one that was

424
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Do it

425
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
All of this

426
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Pixar from

427
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
28 or whatever Showtime

428
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,743
That was part of an investigation that followed the people who have

429
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
A name and then ate numbers after their names

430
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,887
Naming protocol

431
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
There's a lot of really f***** up stuff but

432
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Totally right

433
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
But about the wrong

434
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,359
Trying to manufacture

435
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
The appearance of

436
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Consensus

437
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
And a green

438
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
And people who fall Twitter

439
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Stupid

440
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
And that's very true

441
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Think of these

442
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Bots are real

443
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
I am. Believe me

444
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
People who do

445
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Well you can

446
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Concede

447
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
See the things

448
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
That likes the telling

449
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
For me is

450
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
When he said

451
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,120
It's the group's

452
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
People in your life

453
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,960
OU

454
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
That's another reason I think he's drunk and that's what they're always really cuz I think that's the

455
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
This is

456
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
Zetas

457
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,480
Deep distrust for anyone who knows

458
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
The idea of knowing something

459
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
Is expensive to pay

460
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
People who think it should be

461
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Versus

462
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Empirical evidence

463
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Empirical evidence

464
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Is always going to be more confident

465
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Certainly

466
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Then faith-based people will always

467
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,848
Playing the confidence people have

468
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Always the same people who strongly approve

469
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Who denied

470
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,672
They just released the the Harvard study where they're like

471
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,744
Climate change

472
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
70s

473
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
More like

474
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
So much money

475
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Whichever one

476
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
Thinking in

477
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Space space

478
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,568
Carbon tax is that Al Gore

479
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Globalist Mickey

480
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
Spider-like globalist

481
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
Let's go back to the spiders

482
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,736
Are in the WikiLeaks

483
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,552
What spiders do

484
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
Flies

485
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
There

486
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
Webs

487
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
What is this

488
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
Check out the suitcase

489
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
Idiot

490
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,840
You guys

491
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,936
Spider has a bit of a New Jersey

492
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
I don't know

493
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
I mean come on

494
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
I don't even know what to do with that

495
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Well I think that

496
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,248
Already I'm on he's drunk tip because

497
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
He's talking about spiders

498
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,464
I've noticed that when he's in these moods

499
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
Then whether it is just a harsh man

500
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
Sodor

501
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,096
He's drunk there's a lot of projecting

502
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
What's being done

503
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,448
And the idea of tricking people and stuff like that manufacture

504
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Consensus

505
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
Stuff that he does a lot

506
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,824
Until what are you talkin about

507
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
Trick dumb people

508
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
Are you doing

509
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
You can't possibly think of.

510
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
He either

511
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Literally no way

512
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
He pitched

513
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
Purple Penguin

514
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
For six months

515
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Plus

516
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Any mail

517
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,928
But there's no way that if he had

518
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
If he had faith in his audience

519
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
What do I do

520
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,280
I've met most of our listeners

521
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
You said you had faith in his

522
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Department

523
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Senor pronoun

524
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
That's what's going on

525
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Fair enough

526
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,056
What I'm saying is

527
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
I'm confident that if anybody was looking for the show

528
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
Looked up the purple

529
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Stop

530
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Easily see that

531
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
We are telling

532
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
The truth about it

533
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Alex Jones

534
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
Totally confident knowing that his audience

535
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Will either just blindly

536
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,792
Trust whatever bulshit he say or if they do look it up they'll look it up on zero

537
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
Or WorldNetDaily

538
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,400
Mlgc

539
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,472
Instead of digging a little bit cheaper finding the primary source

540
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
So

541
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
I mean

542
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,336
He's projecting like crazy and do spider voice is

543
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Distract people

544
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Jingling keys

545
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Yeah yeah

546
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
But fake cry

547
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Little bit later

548
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,368
Would you cry

549
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
This is it goes into Alex's victim

550
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Complex

551
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984

00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
I'm here

557
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,120
Letting you know you're not insane when you see their wall of Lies

558
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
You know there's other people that recognize as well we are solitary

559
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,152
The joint

560
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,224
Yeah the first thing obviously is

561
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
First of all it's not true the 10 billion dollar contract

562
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
But if it is

563
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160

566
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,960
Right I think that that's trying to harken back

567
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
To the eye

568
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,592
The Google dualistic narrative

569
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,920
I think it's going back to that cuz I think that was 10 million dollars to

570
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,480
His narrative

571
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
It's b*******

572
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344

00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,104
I was going to say he's awesome he's not

579
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
He wrote a song about that

580
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,760
That was not great

581
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,184
Alex is also

582
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
This is more projection

583
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,768
The idea that they want you to feel alone

584
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Like that because obviously benefits

585
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
People

586
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,704
Like if you go into normal society

587
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
And just regular people and start saying things

588
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
That you heard on Infowars

589
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
Thank you believe that

590
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
People are going to

591
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,408
Naturally get away from

592
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
They're going to like

593
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
This is a weirdo

594
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Person

595
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,832
Speeds be the isolation

596
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
And that may we talk about this in the past it's called stuff

597
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
It's it's just

598
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
He's doing that

599
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm saying this is what

600
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
To feel you to feel like no one else likes

601
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Trump

602
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
You're not alone you got us

603
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Recurring

604
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
Themes throughout all of the all

605
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,616
And it's a throughout gamergate throughout all of this stuff

606
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
It is

607
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
People who are isolated

608
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,016
And that is always the narrative why the internet

609
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,088
Is all of these people who are isolated

610
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
And creating that

611
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
Horrible bigotry and racism

612
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,072
That is really built out of their own into

613
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
Insecurities

614
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
Women of color people

615
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,752
Their bodies of

616
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Spiders The Wiz

617
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Avaz

618
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
You think I can't Alex's

619
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,152
From

620
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
Is insecure fear of spiders

621
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
I mean look if he's afraid of spiders good on it

622
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
I understand

623
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Spiders are where

624
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
They're really weird

625
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Spiders are

626
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
Another not let me tell you about it

627
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Hello story

628
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Got to go tonight

629
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
Stone

630
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Some pig

631
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,080
Wizard of Oz

632
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
Alex

633
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Really expresses

634
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,224
Basically just how excited he is to be relevant

635
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,880
But what comes out of his mouth but it is

636
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,608
Coming up

637
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:07,872
Has receded

638
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:17,344
Literally literally

639
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,416
Comeback

640
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
If there are literal Goblin creatures

641
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
That is all I would

642
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,840
Are you sure

643
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:34,240
I saw a literal Goblin I would shoehorn that into any and every conversation that I was going to

644
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,800
Cocktail party

645
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,896
Oh I just saw this documentary on little Goblin creature

646
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,200
No

647
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
I need to make a documentary about these little Goblin but I can't cuz I can't

648
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,696
Can I please have 10 million dollar contract

649
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Make it afternoon

650
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
Jimmy news

651
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
So

652
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,448
Have you heard

653
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
Love it

654
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,384
I love it that people are talking about me

655
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,224
Which kind of makes you think that no matter how bad an idea it is to hitches

656
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
16

657
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
Along

658
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,440
Stop the other way around

659
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,024
Even though even as much of a bad idea is that is

660
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
He loves it

661
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
It's even if it's negative

662
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Idea of being the number to EDD

663
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
Anime

664
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Is

665
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Proposition

666
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
If you're up

667
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
Power or

668
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,856
Number of enemies

669
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
The number one enemy at Infowars

670
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Boyfriend

671
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,768
Oh yeah

672
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Yeah I think so

673
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:09,216
People are talking about him being investigated by Mueller

674
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
You bet you thought I was on the

675
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
For out of the periphery

676
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
If he's even in the

677
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,760
Anyway that's a debate for another time

678
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Yeah I don't know what

679
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,112
To do with this clip I can't really set it up I don't

680
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
I don't know what to do with

681
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Enjoy

682
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
You got to be lowered first before you can even be

683
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
On the level

684
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
Evil

685
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
People seeking power

686
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
I have fear

687
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
Gods

688
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,016
Power trips positive

689
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,856
But it's only the image of the universe you have in your mind

690
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
Image of God

691
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
Understand

692
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
You are not that thing that you can

693
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
I have a path for you and you will Attain

694
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
Is falling

695
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
This is eaten coming

696
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,792
So much depends on the desk lamp

697
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
Beautiful

698
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
So I made that bed that long pause

699
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Is just like him

700
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
Staring like

701
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
What

702
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:51,872
Try and explain to I wrote down as much of that as I can and I have no idea

703
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,968
Karlos Williams

704
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,904
To get that out or otherwise I couldn't sleep otherwise I could not sleep

705
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,976
I just be staring at Twitter refreshingly

706
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Who's going to f***

707
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Call me out cuz

708
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,752
I know it don't want the beginning of it is upside down

709
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,640
Minos Road

710
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,480
Jesus you're going to be

711
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,368
The beginning part is about that narrative that he has that in order

712
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
For the globalist

713
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,232
To attack you they first have to bring you down

714
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Make you impotent

715
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
Them stuff like that

716
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
I have it done

717
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Do you is not clear

718
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
No but it is

719
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
There's

720
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
Context clues we can take

721
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
I guess

722
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
Destroy you I'm guessing

723
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
I don't know

724
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
So then

725
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,040
Whoever what else what other questions do you have

726
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,600
Does God

727
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Taking power

728
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
As of God

729
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
Right

730
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Right right

731
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,656
It's the image of yourself that you are not like that

732
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,240
Haha

733
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
You are like the

734
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
And then there is

735
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
Nope

736
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,408
I'm starting to think I don't know what

737
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,968
The image of or is

738
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,016
Not here's what I want to believe

739
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,624
Because I'm kind of into it and it'll be awesome if Alex

740
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,952
But I'm thinking maybe what he's saying

741
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
Is that we aren't are flashing bodies

742
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,584
Okay

743
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
To think that you are your fleshy body

744
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,192
But what you are is actually a spark of the

745
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
The divine

746
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
In a pretty how town

747
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:07,296
With you, all right

748
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,088
No I think it's

749
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
I think

750
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,720
That I might be bringing others my own stuff to is but it sounds like it's almost

751
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
Like a gnostic

752
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,816
It's almost like the devil that he's talking about is the

753
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
The demiurge

754
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
They created the physical world that

755
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Retracting

756
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
If you want to go

757
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Planet

758
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,616
Might not even be about the global it could be like

759
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
If that's true

760
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,712
Holyshit

761
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:42,112
Not though it's not because even this is a drunk and sucking an

762
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,000
Talking about fidget string together whatever words are coming out of his mouth

763
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
Beater half thoughts

764
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,912
It feels like he is having a manic episode

765
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
Because he is

766
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,520
Stringing along all of these words which are

767
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
Utterly incapable of keeping up with his putter

768
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
Do they sound like you trying to get to

769
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,480
Sounds like he has an idea

770
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
I may be as the colonel of 1

771
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,088
But be that as it may it take Saturn

772
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
And I hear this

773
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
We're just getting ready to figure out my license

774
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,960
But because I absolutely have to do this and other people have to do it

775
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,640
Why

776
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:43,296
Piles coming on December 1st

777
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,136
Fox News

778
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:52,256
He'd been convicted in prison

779
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,888
What

780
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,752
We got the info to Trump as well

781
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
Federal

782
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,200
Baseball

783
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,344
About

784
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,976
Did not even know that this was happening because

785
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Infowars.com

786
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
Drudge Report

787
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
And I said

788
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:41,408
Lawyers looking to Pardon for you and it almost happened last night

789
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,064
Really about

790
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,464
Back-channel the president

791
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
In Congress

792
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,096
Who's fighting for this Republic

793
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
Fearlessly

794
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
Who is committed

795
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,008
I said Fearless I don't a psychopathic murderer

796
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,568
He fears he's not good enough for this

797
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,664
Now I think Federal

798
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
Centigrade

799
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
It doesn't on air

800
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
And just

801
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
Every

802
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Essence of his

803
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
Is just drained out of him

804
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
I want him dead I wanted legally

805
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,424
I wanted to I wanted to go over the stuff about how awful Joe Arpaio is

806
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
But the last time

807
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Threw up

808
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
So

809
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
He's a true

810
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,872
He's a true f****** monster

811
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
He's a

812
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
If he is

813
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,712
Second pardon John Wayne Gacy

814
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
Cares at this point laws aren't real Only the Strong Survive and murderers

815
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Everything always

816
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,584
Whatever the f*** is goddamn Arpaio

817
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
Presided over the Maricopa

818
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
Maricopa County Police Department

819
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,264
Was was

820
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,360
I demonstrate the worst pattern of racial profiling in our country

821
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
Brief history

822
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,432
He was told repeatedly by judges

823
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,992
Cannot racially profile people

824
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
And he consistently refused

825
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Any of his

826
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Beyond

827
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:32,512
He's a murderer he deprived are human rights

828
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
You give people moldy food

829
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,704
Conditions in prison for

830
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,544
For twenty years for a gram of coke

831
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
F****** mass murderer

832
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,432
Serial killers

833
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Didn't come close to

834
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,016
To each other that's the definition of serial killer

835
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
Doesn't have to be like within

836
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,952
He's responsible much like Sheriff Clarke for

837
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
Tons of

838
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Negligence

839
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,816
And Beyond negligence related deaths

840
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
In his facilities

841
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:12,960
If you want to go listen to the dentist Montgomery episode

842
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
We talked about it

843
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
His officers

844
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
I got

845
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
A cop for entrapment

846
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,152
Cuz they convince someone to create a pipe bomb

847
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,456
A fake bomb attack

848
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
On Joe Arpaio

849
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,040
In order to boost his chances of re-election

850
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:33,440
Yep entrapment isn't the officers of the Maricopa County

851
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Sheriff's Department

852
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Had bought

853
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
Bee balm equipment

854
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
There was record

855
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,864
Other conversations telling this guy

856
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
How to do it

857
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,496
Ended up serving like 9 years in prison because of it before he got free

858
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
Sophie

859
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
The serial killer is

860
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
They're smarter than lawn for

861
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,663
And when you are like they are logged

862
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,247
Realize that there was a higher power

863
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
I'm smarter than myself

864
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Yeah

865
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
F****** monster

866
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Is

867
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
Obama

868
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Federal judge

869
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
Sounds great but I would like

870
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
Obama

871
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,559
I would like a small claims Obama

872
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,679
That would be a daytime show

873
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,239
Yes

874
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
Federal

875
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:28,735
Lowering yourself so I can do it to you

876
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
If you talk about backing it up

877
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
Bounce bounce bounce

878
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,439
The other thing I needed to bring up in my clip is that Alex says

879
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
That Donald Trump

880
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:43,327
Call Joe Arpaio when he found out what was going on

881
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
Yes

882
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
The Narrative is Alex

883
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,215
Totality is the Jerome corsi wrote an article about it

884
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Drudge

885
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
Reposted it

886
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
Donald Trump heard about it

887
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,871
Call Joe Arpaio

888
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
And said we're going to take care of this

889
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Whatever

890
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
When I was on the show

891
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
He flatly contradicts

892
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,575
Not in a correcting way

893
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
But he literally says

894
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
Donald Trump call me

895
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Nobody from his campaign called me

896
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,255
So Alex is just making that up

897
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
Yeah even cuz you been Psychopaths

898
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,119
Serial Killer Joe Arpaio

899
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,703
Which is which is the only way that he should be referred to

900
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
Unwilling

901
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,543
To go along with that

902
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,383
He has every reason to be absolutely Trump

903
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,479
The interview with Raquel talk about too much

904
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,039
Just sucking Trump's dick on

905
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
He just talked about how I'll never leave him he's the greatest

906
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,463
There was only one really funny barbwire Alex's

907
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
Like what are you 80s

908
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,607
Bring that up

909
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
So also revealed

910
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
Also fun Tamara Alex's I claiming is going to start soon

911
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
People that will also come back

912
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,103
A little bit later

913
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,687
This next clip is a little bit of a longer Ram

914
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
He get the spirit gets in

915
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
And

916
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
I think

917
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
What starts the ramp is thinking about having

918
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Kids

919
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
I think

920
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,327
Stuck in his craw and why he ends up launching on this

921
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
I believe it's like 4 minutes

922
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
There's no way I could

923
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,007
Rolling

924
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,311
But I want to remind you

925
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
Live the reason

926
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
He probably feels like he needs to

927
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
To have kids

928
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
Because he does.

929
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,479
Disgusted in this clip in the context

930
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Text of like

931
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Islamists

932
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Some stuff like that

933
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
It's because he wants more white children

934
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,647
Do they talk about birth rates

935
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,207
Some stuff like that. In this clip but he does a lot

936
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Yes

937
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
When he talks about having kids

938
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
Bread but when he talks about having more kids

939
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Them stuff like that

940
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
It's it easy to fall into the Trap of

941
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,263
Nothing like I just wanted a big family and not. But that's not what he's talkin

942
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
He's talking about

943
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
Responsibility to have more

944
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
For kids which is what whitener

945
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,503
Has not diminished

946
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,599
So here is the beginning of the long clip

947
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,159
Will deposit if we need to but

948
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,559
Feel absolutely

949
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
Because

950
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,983
Absolutely

951
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Believe

952
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,199
How desperate Straits are in

953
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:54,559
I love him so much the more children

954
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
God.

955
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,935
Grommet

956
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,335
Civilization as a toy

957
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,767
Like a clown car

958
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,327
Worry about

959
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:06,751
I want you to be with them in their ugliness and their misery and I know it

960
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:12,127
And I understand

961
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,271
This is not the time to hedge bets ladies and gentlemen

962
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,087
This is the time to get on your knees

963
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,183
As God got an erection

964
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
This is the point

965
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,167
Unless you threatened with death and work that day

966
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
Infinity fight

967
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
Alright

968
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,103
We got a new level of Public Accounts

969
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
Books

970
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
Bible

971
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
One-time to get

972
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
Going through it

973
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,095
Beaches garage

974
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,167
Get me

975
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:18,431
That contradicts what you said

976
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Earlier

977
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,015
You said you were winning

978
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,623
And now you're saying that you're losing

979
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:37,119
The score is never clear but you should be on your knees

980
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:47,615
How can I find that will

981
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
I think we do have bingo

982
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,343
Magic the Gathering

983
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
To come into your heart

984
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,695
Wannabe

985
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,279
I Want to Be Free of this scum

986
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:12,191
Football game

987
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,031
No that is what you're trying to

988
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,079
You just kept survival

989
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
This is survival

990
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
What did glitterbug

991
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,367
Me and my family

992
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,719
The world for me to love

993
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
God

994
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
What's Genesis

995
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,695
Excuse

996
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:11,839
Almost there

997
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,167
Little separation between the rest of life

998
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
In-N-Out

999
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,687
Great equalizer

1000
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
Doesn't transmit forward

1001
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,087
I don't know what that is

1002
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,671
The evil drug Transit forward

1003
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:42,559
Weber gets ahold if they're cold

1004
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
That's local

1005
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,935
Straight up like

1006
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:54,079
What is dead may not die

1007
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,967
Even I forgot that was at the assembly

1008
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:05,087
What was the alternate name of the working title that Kevin Spacey movie

1009
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Slightly shortened

1010
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,559
I thought you meant

1011
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:19,167
K-PAX recalled I promise I'm going to play all the clips

1012
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,775
That if I were judging that as like a wrestler doing

1013
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
I would say you need to tighten

1014
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
I would say

1015
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,663
Turn off track a little bit

1016
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,735
I know you're got a big match with the Undertaker coming up

1017
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
Right foot

1018
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
You just

1019
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,063
You're going over to Medi

1020
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
Too many derivation

1021
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
We can't have you in the ring

1022
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
In 45 minutes

1023
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Can't you can't handle

1024
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
You just

1025
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
You gotta

1026
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Give it

1027
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
Get a teleprompter

1028
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
Scripture

1029
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,263
Bullet point

1030
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,847
That might help cuz it has

1031
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
Chevy has on his desk

1032
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
Doesn't understand any

1033
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:09,087
That what what other bullets

1034
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
If I were

1035
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
Organized

1036
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Now this

1037
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:20,351
Is a great game

1038
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Bullet point

1039
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
The devil

1040
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,519
Is that number one

1041
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Sup board

1042
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,991
The nature thereof. Bullet point

1043
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:41,599
The door that we got to get through the devils

1044
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,327
Comenity screams at all the time

1045
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Let's play

1046
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,911
I don't know that that's the

1047
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,215
That's a lot of rambling on sensitive on

1048
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
Refills convict

1049
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
I really think that's

1050
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
What's going on there

1051
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
Also

1052
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,479
I'm going to start making Bingo cards

1053
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,855
I don't know if I'll be able to do one for this episode but

1054
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,927
Absolutely

1055
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,231
That'll be alright that'll be our next

1056
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,327
Can send out 20 yeah yeah yeah put it on the patreon

1057
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,543
You can download your own PDF 07

1058
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
Sorry baby

1059
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
To make a bingo card

1060
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
No priest

1061
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:47,135
Is Alex Jones not believe in a handout

1062
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,791
Globalist

1063
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,679
The only rant

1064
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,727
That we're going to be covering on this episode

1065
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
The

1066
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
The Marquis had

1067
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
Headlining

1068
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
Iran

1069
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,431
I believe nothing

1070
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
He's got nothing

1071
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,735
He's car I think

1072
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
He's drunk

1073
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
I'm not sure might be hungover

1074
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Something like that

1075
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
But

1076
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:21,439
He's got this interview with Steve pieczenik

1077
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,463
The 2nd hour

1078
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,047
Joe Arpaio

1079
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,655
I'm just going to yell about the

1080
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Good

1081
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,055
It seems to be one he uses a lot

1082
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
But

1083
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,151
Write what you know

1084
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,247
People seem to listen

1085
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:50,623
We should scream about the devil for the first hour of the program from now on

1086
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,487
Or Bingo car

1087
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,815
What would you go with

1088
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
What time

1089
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,655
You are my attic slick

1090
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,847
We're just going to do karaoke for the rest of the lyrics to Blood Sweat and Tears great song

1091
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,639
Heidi Heidi ho.

1092
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,663
Sweet Roll

1093
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:20,831
But what am I big karaoke songs

1094
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
By Blood Sweat and Tears

1095
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
You're just Great Horn Rock

1096
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
But at the end

1097
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
He freaks out the leasing

1098
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Freaking out

1099
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,815
But

1100
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
Zoom karaoke I'd run up

1101
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
Someone in the audience

1102
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,447
And screaming in their face

1103
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,871
To add to the theatricality I would fall down on the stick

1104
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,711
You are very good at karaoke

1105
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
That's what happened

1106
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,575
I'm going to do karaoke at Roadhouse bars

1107
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
Central Missouri that have

1108
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
Really cheap

1109
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,463
Big lot of Sloe Gin and hang out with Hillbillies

1110
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
But

1111
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
One thing I liked about a lot of those hillbillies

1112
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,167
Like my boy La Monte out there

1113
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,191
Central Missouri

1114
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,263
Feel it in the air

1115
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
But I worked with

1116
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,335
I just got out of the joint

1117
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:20,735
Call me baby boy all the time

1118
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,039
My hillbilly friends from the past

1119
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
At one of the things that I liked about them was Dave

1120
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
We're country

1121
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
But they were not racist

1122
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
It's not country

1123
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,815
It is next clip Alex.

1124
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,631
Explain why he thinks people think he's racist

1125
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
He's wrong

1126
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
You should not try

1127
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,775
Explain.

1128
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:56,319
Any sensitivity

1129
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,087
President

1130
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Diva quotes

1131
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:02,207
Those are quotes

1132
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,255
You know

1133
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
Episodes

1134
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
See all the racist cities at

1135
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:13,215
Racism

1136
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,871
Because he always complains that no one

1137
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
Five clips

1138
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
Make claims about him

1139
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,967
Spirit clips

1140
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,295
Slow

1141
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
Maybe it's

1142
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Or at least new to me

1143
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,415
Instead of saying that's what I

1144
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,719
Thing like that

1145
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,255
He switches into talking

1146
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:43,167
So it's it's like soundbite was in in the 90s or whatever

1147
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,447
It's almost a

1148
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,775
Disqualifying term before it set

1149
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
If you say always

1150
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
That means

1151
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,151
Is that it

1152
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Focus Group

1153
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
Truth

1154
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
But the connotation

1155
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
Of the phrase

1156
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,903
Makes you feel like oh well they're just making it

1157
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,207
Yeah

1158
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,535
Which is crazy because what I mean like

1159
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,375
Can you describe Penguins or anything like that is anything but eight

1160
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,239
Is a Confederate flag is about his

1161
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
History

1162
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,567
You know all of these different waypoints that we've had over

1163
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,199
Are all the same definition of talking

1164
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
I think that you talk

1165
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,647
Turns out a lot of people are on the same tip for a while

1166
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,671
Goose because

1167
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,999
Cuz the way it may we talk about it like that

1168
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:44,863
Like what we've descended into now everyone's into one thing for a week and then we move on to the next

1169
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,287
Because everyone's talking about

1170
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
Through

1171
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:59,711
People having arguments on Twitter and stuff does almost naturally just conclusions that you come to

1172
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,599
I find that a little bit distasteful to but

1173
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,647
Think I have the same perspective on it Alex does

1174
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
Cuz I don't think

1175
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,207
Global it's doing that I just think it's

1176
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,511
Slightly hivemind

1177
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,303
It's just a lot of people are kind of dumb

1178
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,839
Bluetooth lady something are you liking it

1179
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
Becomes their opinion

1180
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,703
I don't know complicated but

1181
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,495
I like his understanding of what

1182
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
MSNBC

1214
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,295

01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
The intention of it

1237
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,943
It feels bad for us to say that cuz it Doesn't minimize the effects it has on

1238
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,759

1325
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,231
We are skeletons

1326
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,959
Because I've got to have a sales meeting at the shower

1327
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,079
So first of all I think we talked over

1328
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,407
Because it's a subtle thing

1329
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,967
I think I want to go back to try and make my point

1330
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,039
But also are you see there is always extend

1331
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
That's another important point

1332
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,647
The

1333
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,951
These are terrible awful people

1334
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,255
And then there's a little bit of a brief

1335
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,071
What that's when he's got to get into the sales pitch

1336
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,095
But he doesn't

1337
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,631
And then he gets into

1338
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
A sales pitch

1339
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,191
That's the part that's remarkable to me

1340
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,751
Elizabeth is beginning like 15 seconds again

1341
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,287
Hey tell me you don't think

1342
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,079
That went he actions

1343
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,407
Alright let's get to tonight or last night's clip

1344
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,199
That's where the sales pitch is supposed to go

1345
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:04,575
Deceitful

1346
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,391
Right here for you

1347
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,583
You're right

1348
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,263
Yesterday

1349
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,055
Zigzag

1350
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,127
I'm so bored with this dumbass

1351
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,199
I think he's going to

1352
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,087
I'm so bored

1353
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
I'm just

1354
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,695
Picking these tiny little motorcycle that's weird

1355
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,607
Maybe it is for everybody I apologize by waste

1356
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
So

1357
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,751
Alex wants to make a metaphor about the fires of Liberty

1358
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:59,103
Burn the rug

1359
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
That's a great metaphor

1360
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
It's super pain

1361
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,015
But I want to I'm going to spoil what he ends up saying

1362
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,855
Because I think it's important to really bring this into polka

1363
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
He says that

1364
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,463
Are going to

1365
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,023
The globalists are going to run to their castles

1366
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,815
And those castles will be

1367
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
Weather burned in their oven

1368
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
Speed test

1369
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
Basically

1370
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
Not great

1371
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,079
We're going to be there

1372
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,407
There's a couple unfortunate pieces about

1373
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,943
Never say that

1374
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
About somebody

1375
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
Usually a bad idea

1376
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,271
Don't do that

1377
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,831
Especially when Nazis are on the rise in America

1378
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,647
When it's very clear

1379
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
That your worldview is

1380
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
Globalist

1381
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,743
Equals Jew Banker

1382
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
Add stuff like that

1383
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,559
So when you're saying these

1384
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,863
Globalists are running to their tassels

1385
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,655
What most people

1386
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
Especially the bigots

1387
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,703
Get it

1388
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
In the audience

1389
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,495
That

1390
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,567
Those International Jews

1391
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,639
And so when you when you then refer to it as oven

1392
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
It is very very

1393
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
Bad

1394
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
Take Claire dogwood

1395
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
Yeah

1396
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:15,647
So clear if you're not if you're not paying attention though you're like

1397
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,207
That's just how it is

1398
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
Dumbass rhetoric

1399
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,583
When in reality that is signal to all of his

1400
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,167
Nazi followers

1401
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,215
Cuz it sounds like

1402
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Cover it

1403
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
Immediately after

1404
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Like it might just be

1405
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,823
Be something that came out of his mouth

1406
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,103
But make no mistake

1407
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,383
That is not

1408
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,919
Like I don't

1409
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Think that

1410
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,503
There's a hundred other ways

1411
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,063
If you want to say they're going to be burned

1412
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,343
Play

1413
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
Or something like that

1414
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,975
Things people are not burned in oven

1415
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
Except in one

1416
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
Very specific

1417
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,911
There is one other specific

1418
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,287
Another one

1419
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:08,383
Oh oh yeah

1420
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
Not related

1421
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:14,527
That's definitely try to know that

1422
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,135
Even with all that put to the side

1423
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,183
Is f****** torture

1424
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
It is so awful

1425
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,791
Enjoy enjoy literature major

1426
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,935
On fire

1427
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,263
You the fire extinguisher Kohl's robot

1428
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,479
Golf in your own

1429
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
Close up

1430
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,391
And we'll burn down these evil people

1431
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,255
Before

1432
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:05,983
The heavens a week in a time of Ezekiel

1433
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,823
Turning away the tyranny

1434
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,127
Like in Ezekiel

1435
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
Ladies and gentlemen

1436
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,527
You saw that Eclipse you see how beautiful this you know that

1437
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,599
Strong

1438
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
Strong because of the eclipse

1439
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:26,207
Also it was pretty cloudy in Chicago

1440
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,487
Not that impressive

1441
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,279
Although I

1442
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,911
I did make a good joke with my boss

1443
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,983
Really need glasses

1444
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,543
Cloudy out I looked up at it I'm not blind yet

1445
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,103
I hear that happens like the day after

1446
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,431
I don't want to tell you just get cross

1447
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:52,319
Never looks at me

1448
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
This next clip

1449
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
Thought is

1450
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Weird

1451
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
Peter than that

1452
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
No cuz that metaphor wasn't that weird

1453
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:08,191
Like the fires of Liberty getting out of control if you try and put them out

1454
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,495
I think I could make a better metaphor if I wanted to

1455
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,847
But still super weird about that and how bad he is

1456
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
The metaphor

1457
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:18,431
Out of nowhere saying oven

1458
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
Right that's the word

1459
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,783
But this clip

1460
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
I don't I don't even know I don't even

1461
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,855
Know-how

1462
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
They're going to be like three or four parts

1463
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,207
Famous episode that I just don't know how to tell you

1464
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
I don't know what to do

1465
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
So I just have to play with

1466
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,327
Don Lemon

1467
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,751
Images

1468
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:48,895
What is a lawyer did

1469
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,135
He wants to resign

1470
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:06,815
President

1471
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,423
You said that

1472
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
You said that

1473
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,847
Believe

1474
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,535
We should talk to one person

1475
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,583
What does put you in here all alone

1476
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:48,031
And with liquid was coming on later the sheriff

1477
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,639
Do you want to thank us for helping the president

1478
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,735
It's not about it's about the story

1479
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,039
That if you can get to him

1480
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:03,135
Know something's happening he will research

1481
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,511
Globalist play the part of collect

1482
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:20,799
One-sided

1483
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,711
They're coming

1484
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,495
And we are bracing now

1485
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:54,335
Gcnlive.

1486
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:03,295
Shout out at the end of a

1487
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,599
He's got to get stuff out off his chest

1488
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,903
That we've accomplished more in the last

1489
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,695
Two years that we have in the last hundred

1490
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
Is f*****

1491
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
That is so f*****

1492
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Because

1493
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
What happened in the last hundred years

1494
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,399
Civil Rights Act

1495
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,007
New Deal

1496
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
What else

1497
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,223
What is

1498
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,271
What have we accomplished in the past

1499
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:41,695
What is Trump and the Patriots a screwed-up to the false group that Alex

1500
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
Thanks as a present

1501
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
That's what

1502
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:46,815
No

1503
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,911
Of course not all of the strictures of Global's

1504
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,471
As we understand what Alex's

1505
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Believe

1506
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,287
In our previous episode

1507
01:15:56,543 --> 01:16:02,687
None of them know and if Trump really did want

1508
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,711
To do what Alex

1509
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,295
What he would have done immediately.

1510
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
The fat

1511
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,623
Like if you was the person that Alex Jones thinks

1512
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
He would have bought it at the side

1513
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,719
That's the biggest thing for the

1514
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,743
Globalist

1515
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
Hawking wingdings

1516
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,583
Is the idea of a federal bank

1517
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
Needs to be checked

1518
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,703
Because all this national debt isn't real

1519
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
Have you audited

1520
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:32,639
You find it all these Baxter's

1521
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
Then we should put them

1522
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:39,295
Well the Federal reserve's

1523
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,367
Really the Federal Reserve

1524
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,647
The idea of

1525
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,415
The Federal Reserve

1526
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,463
I'm starting to actually

1527
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Think that Alex Jones might vs Auburn

1528
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,583
I found a clip from 2015 that makes me

1529
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,887
But he might really actually be on that

1530
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,215
I call it will get to it eventually in the investigation

1531
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,751
But a caller calls in and

1532
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,311
Explain the idea of Maritime admiralty

1533
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:06,431
Dialysis

1534
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:13,087
Okay I'm confused as to what he was

1535
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
He was talk

1536
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
Secret people

1537
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,047
Like scammers

1538
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,863
Campaign office

1539
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:31,775
This is something we've talked about before then

1540
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,639
Turn off

1541
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,919
MN riots

1542
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,319
The Originals

1543
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
And then

1544
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:53,279
But all the leakers would put us two years from

1545
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:59,423
Campaign whenever Rogers Hornsby sing the people in the white house we're almost fired

1546
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,055
The man who legally can get nowhere near the White House

1547
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,639
You can get as close to the lighthouses in Kansas

1548
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
CNN

1549
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,247
Reince priebus

1550
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,271
Tenure

1551
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,319
Don't overlap at all

1552
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:20,927
This is just a convoluted narrative that Alex has a globalist

1553
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,719
Inside were trying to trick

1554
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
Trump loyalists

1555
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
Into quitting

1556
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:30,143
And then they do not jump he's like

1557
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,167
Let's just not

1558
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,727
Which

1559
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,311
We're dealing with so that probably would have

1560
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,383
Yeah probably anybody's office

1561
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:43,711
Doesn't burn like Trump fired you ignore you

1562
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
That is a description

1563
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,071
Jen of one of the most disorganized

1564
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
Chaotic

1565
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,887
Backstabber

1566
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
Awful Administration

1567
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,959
I can possibly imagine

1568
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,007
To even

1569
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,287
The reality

1570
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,823
That's terrible

1571
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,359
Yeah we probably shouldn't

1572
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,383
Allow them to have any

1573
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,151
Kind of government

1574
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
Do you know what

1575
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,759
Even if they are

1576
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,527
Real fuk up

1577
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
They're screwing up

1578
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,855
Creating a ministration

1579
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
That's okay

1580
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,927
That's okay

1581
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,999
And every possible respect that literally

1582
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,791
Not one thing they have done

1583
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,071
With any sort of cop

1584
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
Implement any of that

1585
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,751
These are the dumbest people

1586
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,031
In the history

1587
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,311
Of American

1588
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,103
Jordan I can tell you one thing

1589
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:43,871
What they've done

1590
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,407
That is not terrible

1591
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,455
That is not created any

1592
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,991
Babies that don't have souls

1593
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,063
Now listen to this next clip

1594
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,903
No infinities

1595
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
Never

1596
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
Never

1597
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,743
No no

01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:04,863
Yo no no no no no no no no no no no

1599
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,959
No no no no you will not get control

1600
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:15,360
You will not win you will not tell everybody you will not deform everyone

1601
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:26,368
It's a person

1602
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,488
They're like

1603
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,304
This for pericecal izle

Imprint

1605
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
They just take on

Program

1607
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:46,336
And just go around power trips

1608
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,896
Artificial synthetic sociopath

1609
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,992
As opposed to our homegrown socio

1610
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,112
Once which they want to cut off its virtue

1611
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
He's no chewing on Kanis

1612
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:07,328
Innocence is the window into Xfinity from mind of God

1613
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:12,448
Ever seeking ever-lovin ever

1614
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
Wishing

1615
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:26,784
Set trailcal he mailed babe

1616
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,440
You know that's how you really

1617
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,232
Radicalize your audience

1618
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,792
The mainline people

1619
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,816
Who opposed

1620
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
Political ideas

1621
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,912
Want to kill your children

1622
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
They would run through a kindergarten with a hatchet

1623
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,032
Which I want to say is maybe a stab at the Juggalos

1624
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,568
And I don't appreciate that

1625
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,872
So their symbol is a guy running with a hatchet

1626
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,664
Oh okay

1627
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,968
Publix

1628
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,504
Redhatter

1629
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,088
In the movie The Patriots

1630
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:05,696
I'm guessing based on his reading level

1631
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
So

1632
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,816
Well he was fake crying so maybe read where the red

1633
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
Could be

1634
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,120
Thor Bridge

1635
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
To Terabithia

1636
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
Other children's books

1637
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:18,496
The other day don't hold on hold on

1638
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,568
I know you're chomping at the bit there

1639
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,896
We need to unpack this very important piece

1640
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,176
The way

1641
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
In that clip

1642
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,760
Leads me to believe he

1643
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,296
Big

1644
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,112
That's a lot of people who disagree with him

1645
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
Are clones

1646
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
I kind of feel that way

1647
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,792
As if like

1648
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,608
He's not talking about a hypothetical future

1649
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,400
He's talking about these

1650
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:51,520
Synthetic will walking around even a metaphorical description

1651
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:54,592
640 baby

1652
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Even said like

1653
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,064
They got five parrots

1654
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,136
But they don't have souls

1655
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:10,976
Like wait but how many parents do you need

1656
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:18,400
Vitro fertilization mean you don't have it

1657
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:24,800
Multiple genetic material coming out of his idea if we took his logic to its

1658
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:29,152
Don't have a soul

1659
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
Yeah

1660
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,736
How else would you get that synthetic

1661
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,016
Senzo feedback

1662
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Sociopath

1663
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,880
Chicopee state

1664
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:42,720
Bet you believe

1665
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,792
Woodmont would disagree with it

1666
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,632
The devil the devil is real

1667
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:56,032
And he's doing all kinds of clones running around all over the place because they have five

1668
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,080
Oh my God this is

1669
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:04,480
Open the WikiLeaks

1670
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,552
All people talk about it was on the show

1671
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,112
So much more The Source here

1672
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
What

1673
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,672
Best

1674
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Like this

1675
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,232
Is the type of ship

1676
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:18,048
It's like every every article you see

1677
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
Dislike

1678
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:24,448
How did Trump people feel about Trump now that he's ruining their lives and they don't even know it

1679
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
It's like here's what they feel

1680
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:32,640
Anybody disagrees with them is trying to murder

1681
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,688
Them every single point

1682
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,992
Or password

1683
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,016
The point of

1684
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,624
Can you talk to these people because they think you're trying to

1685
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:49,024
I would never never operate in the same I'm still willing to even talk to

1686
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,608
I will give everyone the benefit

1687
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,400
Until proven otherwise

1688
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,728
I don't like descending into that we can't talk to the other side

1689
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
Stop

1690
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,544
But I do believe that a large

1691
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,104
Portion of the people who won't turn on Trump

1692
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,872
Despite

1693
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,920
Mounting evidence

1694
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,968
The Russian ship being

1695
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,992
Mary real

1696
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
And

1697
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,296
The fact that he's just going

1698
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,576
To destroy

1699
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,112
The entire country through his

1700
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,392
Ego greed

1701
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,720
Siphoning off money to his own businesses

1702
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:24,096
The siphoning off money all the kleptocracy s***

1703
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,168
Right so but like they will never turn on it because

1704
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,472
They are indoctrinated into this called

1705
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Essentially

1706
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,800
Globalist

1707
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:39,456
Why

1708
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:45,856
I'm particularly offended by Joe Rogan jumping on board with a lot of these people who are in The Alex Jones

1709
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
Yeah as it were

1710
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,488
I understand he wants to give a fair day in court to all sorts

1711
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,256
The people but

1712
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,792
If Peter Schiff was on

1713
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,584
Let's say

1714
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,656
There's no way we would allow him to say the things

1715
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
But he says

1716
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,216
Without at least pushing Back 40

1717
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,496
Considerably on these

1718
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,056
These ideas be faulty economic ideas

1719
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:08,128
Well if we had a monarch we would spend a week

1720
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
Prepping

1721
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,920
We would have

1722
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,480
We would have everything

1723
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
He regularly

1724
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
It's about weed

1725
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,552
Charts

1726
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,600
We would go through all of this

1727
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,416
Because we care I'm probably try not to talk about his dad

1728
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,952
I think it would be hilarious

1729
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
Oh yeah

1730
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,352
The point is my point

1731
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:31,168
Is this even if we're going outside of our

1732
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,960
That we follow along

1733
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,752
Even the mainstream

1734
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,032
GOP people

1735
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,824
Even whenever they give us this

1736
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,128
Dislike Trump is reach the 60

1737
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
4%

1738
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:41,920
The proofing

1739
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,480
The GOP will still vote 48

1740
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,016
Percent for

1741
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,832
Right

1742
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:49,856
8

1743
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,928
4 / over the

1744
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,720
This is what we used to be

1745
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,072
It will still be every GOP voter voting for

1746
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,400
Exist as a

1747
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
Positive

1748
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
There's no

1749
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,496
Republicans are for

1750
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,336
A non-existent

1751
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
They are just

1752
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,408
They are just filled with I hate this

1753
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,712
And they will use any rationale

1754
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,736
Justify their

1755
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:20,064
But I don't think it's fair to say that and not say that it is

1756
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,648
True that most Democrats would just vote for any Democrat also

1757
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,464
Makes it okay because obviously

1758
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
Lee Trump is

1759
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:34,656
Then any political alignment is that same block step walking

1760
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:43,616
Specifically blaming Trump

1761
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:47,712
A bottle but I I just think it's

1762
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,504
Do you know it's important to be fair

1763
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,784
There's a lot of

1764
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,552
Just

1765
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,320
You know

1766
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,368
Mindless

1767
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,928
The other side socks our side is great

1768
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,976
Another kind of problem

1769
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
Rissa

1770
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:04,352
Especially when party systems in the world today

1771
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,632
I think that is

1772
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,168
Not entirely what I was

1773
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Was talking about

1774
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,472
Hey I was talking

1775
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
More about

1776
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,544
Rather than it being a

1777
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,312
Party

1778
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,360
It's more just

1779
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
This is that right ideology

1780
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,968
No

1781
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:26,368
I think you're wrong.

1782
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,648
Is very malleable

1783
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,720
They fall in line with whatever fits

1784
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:33,536
The most important pieces of their ideology which is

1785
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,072
Don't give stuff

1786
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:35,840
Two people

1787
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,120
Diane lower taxes

1788
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,936
But that's all

1789
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,032
Negative

1790
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,312
Call a.j.

1791
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,336
Remove

1792
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:49,408
Well then we don't get that way

1793
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:53,248
Rationalize any of these dumbass

1794
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,064
You know Obamacare is bad

1795
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,624
The rationalized with

1796
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,160
Just because they hate Obama

1797
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:06,560
Just because they want to tear down

1798
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,584
Wage was like

1799
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,632
Minimum having a minimum wage

1800
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,912
Employee

1801
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,192
Because

1802
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,472
Hey you know what

1803
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:17,312
Say you want a job and you want to work for $3 an hour

1804
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,848
UPS

1805
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,896
You don't have the power to do that

1806
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,456
Because you can't it's against the law

1807
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:27,808
So if you want to have that if you want to have that

1808
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:33,952
In our world what you get is $0 an hour cuz you can't have a job but if there was no minimum wage

1809
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,000
If you could get that $3 an hour job

1810
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,792
You be making $3 an hour

1811
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,840
It's all stupid

1812
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
Is that

1813
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:48,288
His conception of taking away the minimum wage which we know is a negative

1814
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,360
He's trying to make it a positive for everybody

1815
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,640
This is a game for you

1816
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,712
You could get $3 hour and 20

1817
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:59,296
Again that's just a rationalization for their

1818
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,320
Hell-bent

1819
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,368
Destruction of the new deal

1820
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,928
Like that's all they really want

1821
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,768
The Rings upon dreams upon reams of history book

1822
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,304
Explaining

1823
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,584
People are so f******

1824
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Dumb

1825
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,400
Process

1826
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:18,752
Will just always come up with some sort of alternative or something

1827
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,288
Written

1828
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,848
Heritage Foundation

1829
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:29,248
Only ancillary disproves a small tiny little bit of this if it even does that at all

1830
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,808
We have our own special

1831
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,088
Gotcha

1832
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,416
What about like that

1833
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
They don't

1834
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,464
Believe in anything

1835
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,840
Well

1836
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:51,008
They just don't want any of this s*** around because they hate

1837
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:55,360
But now I'm deeply concerned because there is there is

1838
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,432
But

1839
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,712
University party

1840
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,272
Has come to prominence and now

1841
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:06,368
The Tea Party is kind of absorbed into the larger Patriot movement

1842
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,672
Whatever you want to call

1843
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,720
Because there's a lot of there's a lot of

1844
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:14,304
There's a lot of moving pieces with it but they're all sort of coming

1845
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,072
Together

1846
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:18,912
Draws them all together is a really anti-government

1847
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,960
Release anti federal government

1848
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,728
Stamps

1849
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:25,056
They're like the witch of Liberty hard libertarian

1850
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,616
The Liberty people the Patriots

1851
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,640
Even the alt-right

1852
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,176
There is a Peter Schiff

1853
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,712
But if there is a

1854
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,992
Complete believe

1855
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:37,088
That the federal government imposing anything on you is

1856
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,904
Some sort of a crime or violence against

1857
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,280
It is as that gets absorbed into the GOP

1858
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,584
And becomes the mainstream of the

1859
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,864
Conservative side

1860
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,936
You you look at a really dangerous proposition

1861
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,472
Do you know Prince

1862
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:55,520
Nipples is almost better to that

1863
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
Straight up

1864
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,848
Destruction

1865
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:05,760
How do you run a campaign where one person is like I think the Federal

1866
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,784
Government to do nothing

1867
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,064
Brooklyn

1868
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,088
I have some ideas

1869
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Right

1870
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,904
What you do how does that argument work

1871
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:12,928
I don't know

1872
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:16,000
The federal government doing nothing is really the best

1873
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:16,768
For you

1874
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:23,680
That's the argument if you're trying to run a campaign on no I'm saying or down the government debate end up

1875
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,960
Working cuz the person

1876
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,984
On the other side

1877
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,520
Just forced to take the position of

1878
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,056
Federal government

1879
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,616
Whereas logical position is

1880
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,688
Federal government has its problems with there's some things we need to work out in

1881
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,248
There's so much.

1882
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,528
It would never

1883
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,320
Ever ever be possible

1884
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:43,648
Were it not for federal government intervention

1885
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,184
Yep

1886
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
Like

1887
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,512
Dirk carry the load of this larger population

1888
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,816
Urban centers existing

1889
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:55,168
Astronomy

1890
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,192
Beginning

1891
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,728
With Federal invest

1892
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,688
Higher leaf

1893
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,968
The federal government

1894
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,296
Search

1895
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,880
Play technology the Arts

1896
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:17,440
Culture

1897
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:21,024
The Civil War is not going to

1898
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
Canan

1899
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,840
State score

1900
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,120
You know north-south any

1901
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,168
Cities versus

1902
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:35,616
Imagine it like if I will I will never take up arms against La Monte

1903
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,920
God dammit

1904
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:41,248
I know if we switched even though you know like

1905
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,880
Ancient classical times

1906
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
It's

1907
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,184
All of this stuff

1908
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,208
So much would just

1909
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,256
Destroyed and lost

1910
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,072
Without some sort of unifying federal government

1911
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,864
Chicago is

1912
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,424
It would be

1913
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,704
Jackson

1914
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:07,360
And they calling for anti-government

1915
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,432
The most anti-government

1916
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,968
Are the ones who are going to die

1917
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Maybe

1918
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,320
That's what they have there is a death call

1919
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:23,232
Call I don't know. You sound like out

1920
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,024
Run through your daycare

1921
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
With a hatchet

1922
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,328
So

1923
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,120
I don't stand by that new.

1924
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,192
So in this next clip

1925
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,472
This is fun

1926
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,264
Cousin

1927
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,544
How do you know what

1928
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
I'm just

1929
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
I'm just a f***

1930
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,872
Done

1931
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,408
I'm just so f****** done with

1932
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
These people

1933
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
Get started

1934
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,784
Babies with no stove

1935
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,600
So this next clip with five

1936
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
Alex Jones

1937
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:53,952
Gets mad

1938
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
Which is hilarious

1939
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,536
Pretty fun

1940
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,560
A butt

1941
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,608
He starts getting into it

1942
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,888
Start making jokes

1943
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,424
And you can't do that.

1944
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,728
That's not good you can't tell from the audio

1945
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,776
What is on Skype

1946
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,312
And you can see him laughing

1947
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,664
The Intern

1948
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,432
Steve pieczenik

1949
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,272
He gets on the bike

1950
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
For the first time

1951
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,344
Strongly disagree with

1952
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:29,536
Looking for a way out

1953
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:36,192
Again the same lies and McConnell deserting him

1954
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:49,760
This is a test controlling the narrative

1955
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,696
I kill a lot of people

1956
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,864
Hey dude

1957
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,192
Ordered killed yourself

1958
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:33,536
I want

1959
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:40,192
127

1960
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,744
I want to do stupid

1961
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,896
Steven looks like

1962
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:30,880
Reality

1963
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
Fake laugh

1964
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,008
I'm sorry

1965
01:37:54,176 --> 01:38:00,320
Yeah

1966
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,136
It's okay go ahead

1967
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:15,424
I don't think anybody really

1968
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,528
How is this okay

1969
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:35,904
It's okay for anyting anywhere anybody because this is us Steve pieczenik

1970
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,208
Maintains his space in the order

1971
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,792
Just Mindless sycophant

1972
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:46,656
Able to trick Alex into believing all these counter-coup narrative

1973
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,680
Some stuff like that

1974
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
Whatever Alex goes off on

1975
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:52,800
Whatever the f*** that was

1976
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,848
Just laughing is me a big like

1977
01:38:55,104 --> 01:39:00,224
And then almost immediately transitioning into the point

1978
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:05,088
Which I actually kind of agree with some of the point is we don't need to listen to none of him

1979
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,136
Talking about how

1980
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,232
We can we cannot

1981
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,256
Duplicate

1982
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,024
Continue it

1983
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,584
Sending more troops is a really terrible idea

1984
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,448
That's clearly it's clearly the work

1985
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
It worked into

1986
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,520
It worked

1987
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,824
In 2011

1988
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,872
2000

1989
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,408
Burton 2004

1990
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,176
It worked

1991
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
In 2006

1992
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,480
It worked in

1993
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
I don't

1994
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,832
Agree with Steve pieczenik about a lot

1995
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,600
Disease

1996
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
A little bit not

1997
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,696
But I do agree

1998
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,488
Listening to him kind of boring

1999
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,584
It's just so gross

2000
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,888
Natsu

2001
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,168
Is even worse than

2002
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,496
Pull it off by thingy

2003
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,520
And I love down

2004
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:56,800
I love them

2005
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,824
What is that

2006
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,896
It's just f******

2007
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,432
Disgusting

2008
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,528
Saltz Colorado by calling him retarded then says I loved

2009
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:09,088
I give the Special Olympics as people are

2010
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,648
And then says what Karl Rove does have idiots

2011
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:12,928
Like what

2012
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,464
This is a world

2013
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,512
Jesus has no Bass

2014
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,280
But anyway

2015
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,352
We can't make it bog down

2016
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:24,192
It's just him being stupid it's the fundamental inability

2017
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:24,960
To treat

2018
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,056
It's almost like he's a synthetic psychopath

2019
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,640
Or or easy could just be

2020
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,200
Eclipse starts with

2021
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:42,368
This next clip starts with the what is pretty inspiring tone and then gets to something I

2022
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,392
I can't believe it's

2023
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,720
So that's at this will be another Whirlwind roller

2024
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:49,280
You never know when you're doing little thing

2025
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,560
How big it is

2026
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,096
An example of

2027
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:59,008
Millions and and and

2028
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:05,152
Most people

2029
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:11,808
2000

2030
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,184
10 TV shows ever

2031
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:22,560
Values

2032
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:26,656
Hank Hill Terrier

2033
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:37,152
Shirley Wright

2034
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,944
Dale Gribble the conspiracy theorist

2035
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,832
Alex Jones

2036
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Yep Hank Hill

2037
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,648
But also Dale Gray

2038
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:51,488
Is

2039
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,768
His death

2040
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:57,632
Is Grandpa and crazy weirdo who's on the TV

2041
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,168
Exactly

2042
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:05,568
I don't know I've heard a lot about

2043
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:08,128
Everytime I think about Hank Hill I'm like

2044
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:10,688
Hello to Alex Jones

2045
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,528
I don't think Alex

2046
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,808
Quite.

2047
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:22,208
The point of King of the Hill where the humor came from

2048
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,512
He doesn't have

2049
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,072
He just sees that and goes

2050
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:30,656
Oh look it's my values being reflected

2051
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:36,544
Biting satire

2052
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,592
But also there is

2053
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,128
Literally

2054
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,152
No way

2055
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,456
That Mike Judge

2056
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,480
True

2057
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,272
Like the two of them are French

2058
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:48,320
Hank Hill based on

2059
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,672
But the other thing is I like where he's coming from at the beginning

2060
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
Call Larry

2061
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,488
If it's true

2062
01:42:55,744 --> 01:43:01,888
The I like when he's coming from at the beginning when he's saying that you never know who you're reaching like today we got the email from

2063
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,936
Estonian

2064
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:07,008
We have gotten a lot of emails and

2065
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:09,056
Messages from people who

2066
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:11,872
I have no f****** idea how they found the show

2067
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:13,152
And it's really cool

2068
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,712
It's really neat to know the people are listening

2069
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,504
Isn't that kind of a message from Alex

2070
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
I can dig it

2071
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,808
Well I love it

2072
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
The bases

2073
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,904
Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers

2074
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,440
But you

2075
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,864
The other thing is we should say that David Knight

2076
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,144
Has finally launched his own

2077
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,704
They broadcast in the morning

2078
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:41,056
David has got his own show real news

2079
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,104
I have not watched it

2080
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,432
Because of course I'm not going to watch that it's got to be boring as s***

2081
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,480
Real News Real do

2082
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,248
With David

2083
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,552
Here's the news

2084
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,344
I get jumped from Aunt

2085
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,976
Who's the news

2086
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:03,840
Terrible Herbst trash

2087
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:06,144
No we're not making fun of his based on his

2088
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:10,752
I saw a picture of him from early

2089
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,776
I like

2090
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,568
Around 2008 or so

2091
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
Holy

2092
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,360
He was spelled

2093
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:19,712
He has gotten I'm not insulting him he looks fine cuz he looks like a

2094
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:26,112
Do you also love Down syndrome kids know he looks like it looks like a condom evil Grandpa

2095
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,904
9 Grandpa

2096
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:33,792
He probably probably would like a good 40 lb

2097
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
Lighter

2098
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,584
Like his face

2099
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
Slim

2100
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,704
Weirded me out

2101
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,496
Doesn't that imply that

2102
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,776
It's not real news

2103
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:48,384
If you're reinforcing the idea that it's real news maybe it's more like

2104
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:51,200
No no it's real news

2105
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,760
It's real news don't go don't go

2106
01:44:54,016 --> 01:45:00,160
It's real news the first episode was about how Luanne from King of the Hill

2107
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,120
Skip this next court cuz it's just Alex Jones millions of dollars of funding

2108
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,656
Because this neck

2109
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,704
But that we are going to play as much more important

2110
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:17,568
Steve pieczenik is on hold music

2111
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,592
Open Skype

2112
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
Studio

2113
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:22,176
Call from

2114
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,992
I can only describe as anti-Semitic

2115
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,528
And let's see what happens

2116
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,064
Is his name anti-Semitic

2117
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,344
Might as well be

2118
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:34,464
11:20 a.m.

2119
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:40,864
Wbcm wants to talk about Afghanistan

2120
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:45,728
Listen honor to speak to Alexa like you

2121
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:51,616
This is what I want to say we need to get out of Afghanistan the Middle East is no point of us being there

2122
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,856
Tremendous power

2123
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,472
Between for Trump

2124
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:23,616
Who was an international Jewish Banker, doesn't it colonists

2125
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,456
Who's behind the Occupy Wall Street movement

2126
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,576
Dianne Feinstein

2127
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:55,104
You got Soro trying to overthrow Israel Netanyahu

2128
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,152
In the documents in the lazy lake

2129
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,952
Images

2130
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,256
Heavy Collective as models

2131
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:15,584
Israel

2132
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,656
Come on

2133
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,704
Prank called anti-israel

2134
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,008
Israel

2135
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:32,224
Yeah that wasn't exactly was a occupation

2136
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,720
What is your real view on this

2137
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:45,280
The guy that did the

2138
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,288
Oh no thanks for that

2139
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:07,808
We got us

2140
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
From Alex Jones

2141
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:10,880
Pronouncing it

2142
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,904
Quad

2143
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952
What's

2144
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,000
I love you

2145
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Keep us in

2146
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:24,448
Make sure you destabilize the Middle East

2147
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:28,544
Has attempted to save another's all kinds of different

2148
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,408
Which is a nice way to put it

2149
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:36,736
Because they're left it's not because they're Jews

2150
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,808
Different Jews it takes

2151
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:44,928
Apec isn't a leftist organization at all

2152
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:51,328
Bari Lynn one of the most hard right the f****** country is

2153
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,120
So he's home

2154
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:55,936
Argument

2155
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,704
The guy

2156
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,776
Was

2157
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:02,080
Respect

2158
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
But that guy

2159
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,920
Is he

2160
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,944
Spencer

2161
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,968
Salute

2162
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,760
He would rather blame Jews for

2163
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:13,600
Oh I know a group of people who would rather blame Jews for their problem

2164
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:16,672
Can you think of another group of people who hate

2165
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,488
Anti globalist

2166
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,256
Haha

2167
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:23,840
Let's see

2168
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:26,912
Banana

2169
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
Okay

2170
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:32,288
Speaking of someone who probably totally cool with an optic

2171
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,616
Joe arpaio's time

2172
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
This this clip

2173
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:46,112
I really feels about what's been done

2174
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,904
To him

2175
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,512
Quiet and we'll get through it

2176
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:57,376
I only have like four clips of him or so and mostly they're just him saying stupid s***

2177
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,912
So we can get through it

2178
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,936
Just don't yell

2179
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:01,216
Just keep it in

2180
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,264
This first clip

2181
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,848
Is really it's kind of funny when you look at the big

2182
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,152
Unfortunately it's not funny

2183
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,944
He's responsible for many deaths

2184
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,760
Visions of horrible crimes

2185
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,808
Because victims were

2186
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
Immigrants

2187
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,368
In this together

2188
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,232
Brotherhood

2189
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:27,584
Persecuted

2190
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:38,080
Golden talk to you yet him on so I have a good lawyer

2191
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,104
For a change

2192
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,664
I'm fighting this

2193
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,480
And I'm never going to surrender

2194
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:49,856
And I'll tell you I'm going to try to get the real story out about the abuse

2195
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:52,672
It was.

2196
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:55,232
Think of that

2197
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,352
And that's dangerous for our country

2198
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:02,656
Can do it to anybody

2199
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,472
Is atrocious

2200
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,312
Currently not true

2201
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:16,736
Comfortable with the fact that if you are a serial killer apparently you can't do anything to that f***

2202
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:23,904
Time Trump has not pardon him and there's some question

2203
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,952
Even has the authority to do that

2204
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:26,720
I don't think he does

2205
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,560
The idea that

2206
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,120
He's portraying this is a Witch Hunt against him is funny

2207
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,168
But if you just take this sentence

2208
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,216
If they can do this to me

2209
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:38,752
They can do it to anybody

2210
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,288
And I am

2211
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,312
Braum's

2212
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,384
Is it if they can do

2213
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,408
Which is

2214
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,944
Pursue legal action

2215
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,016
Court

2216
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:52,576
If you are that person

2217
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:53,856
Who

2218
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,928
Has a clear history of racial profiling

2219
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,464
Abusively

2220
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,744
In a police department

2221
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:03,072
I'm fine with that happening to anybody who does that

2222
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,520
You like I'm fine. I'm not doing that

2223
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,616
I'm not committing the race place

2224
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,640
Offenses

2225
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,712
Suck it

2226
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:22,272
Can convict me of a crime I committed

2227
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,064
What's next

2228
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:29,440
You don't want to live in that America

2229
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:32,512
You don't want to live in America where people who commit crimes

2230
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:39,168
F****** investigating arrested for it we don't live in that f****** America.

2231
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:40,960
He's being charged

2232
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:45,056
Of course nonsense because he deserves to be here

2233
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:45,824
So much more

2234
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,712
There's something more going on

2235
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,016
Consistently refuses

2236
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,808
What he's talking about

2237
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,576
Because

2238
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,600
He hasn't been pardoned

2239
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,720
About talking about the case publicly before you

2240
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
In the clear

2241
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:07,328
So you keep saying like more better lawyer than Alex

2242
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:13,728
I can't talk about it now I'm not going to get into it

2243
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:14,752
I love

2244
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,104
But you accidentally does white slip what he thinks

2245
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,896
This is actually going on in this next

2246
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:27,552
Nazi collaborator

2247
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:34,720
Well he's here

2248
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,768
Negative talk about now why feel

2249
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:41,888
He really went after me and I'm not going to get into birth certificates right now

2250
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,960
Subject matter

2251
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,008
You did just get into it

2252
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:52,640
Look at you think there's another reason why Soros hates me I'm not going to get into it but it's

2253
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:58,528
It's my b******* about Obama and how his birth certificate is allegedly faked which

2254
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:04,160
Are we still on that are we still on the bus

2255
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
Jesus

2256
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,512
F****** ass

2257
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,584
Piece of s***

2258
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,376
Go to a federal pen

2259
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
VenturianTale

2260
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,680
Dies

2261
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,984
Like everyone

2262
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,776
I'm not seeing enough recognition

2263
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,312
People talking about like

2264
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:24,640
What's the connection between Trump

2265
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:27,200
They were the President and Vice President

2266
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:30,272
Obama's birth certificate is fake Club

2267
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,576
Jude allies

2268
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,904
Alex is hold b******* about like

2269
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,976
Know that Ohio was being

2270
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,512
Do you know if taken

2271
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,912
The two of them are allies

2272
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:50,240
To imagine

2273
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,968
The only reason from

2274
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:00,992
Degree

2275
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,528
Normal allies yes

2276
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,832
But this was a we are racist

2277
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,368
Together

2278
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,976
Illegal immigrants

2279
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:12,768
We hate

2280
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:14,816
Anybody

2281
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,096
We hate Max

2282
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,376
Because we hate everybody

2283
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
Anybody not white

2284
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:21,728
I think bigotry Bond

2285
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,776
The coward

2286
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:27,616
A hateful person's version of being in a foxhole with someone

2287
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,408
Because the two of them

2288
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:33,248
Look the world around them being a

2289
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,272
Attack on whites

2290
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,040
All the time

2291
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:37,088
I'm needing to protect White

2292
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:40,672
Kind of a war that they're in

2293
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:41,696
Heather Conrad

2294
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,536
I don't think that necessarily

2295
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,888
I think the Trump would definitely pardon him if you can

2296
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,168
Yeah

2297
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:53,984
I think there's a big part of that is because

2298
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,776
The two of them had that birther

2299
01:55:56,032 --> 01:56:02,176
War together

2300
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,992
He can see that his dumbass Bass

2301
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,088
Like

2302
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,184
Infowars and all those people start going

2303
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:17,024
This is a good man this is Deborah

2304
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,072
Serial killer

2305
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:19,840
It's possible

2306
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:23,424
And so it's just one of those things where cuz they

2307
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,960
They have the same

2308
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:27,008
Where in Trump says something

2309
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,056
Fox News says how it's a great idea

2310
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,336
So Trump keeps

2311
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:33,152
Says this is a great ideas

2312
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,176
The Trump is like

2313
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:36,480
People who love me are going to love this idea

2314
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,040
So he talks about it and so on and so forth

2315
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:43,904
They just found shity ideas off of each other

2316
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,696
They're burning the world

2317
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,488
They're burning the world

2318
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,280
Yeah you may be right

2319
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:53,120
Anyway we'll never know for sure until it's too late to move on

2320
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:55,680
The next Clippers

2321
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,728
Ferrari internationalism

2322
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,568
You'll know why as this clip goes on

2323
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:08,992
He's great overseas I think you know the more than any signal when is

2324
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:15,904
They just love if you are an international listener of knowledge fight

2325
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:21,792
Please send us an email at knowledge Gmail

2326
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:24,352
Is that the same to you get I would like to know

2327
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,400
I would like to know cuz I am not overseas

2328
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,448
I would like to know from the perspective

2329
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,984
OVA are listeners

2330
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,008
All over Europe

2331
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,288
Landa other

2332
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,824
Places that are probably listening

2333
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,848
That happened contact

2334
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:39,200
I'd like to hear from you let me know

2335
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:41,248
That won't throw me off at all

2336
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,320
If your

2337
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:49,184
Trump is our listeners like Trump

2338
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:53,024
That would throw me off quite a bit osher but it's that way

2339
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,560
But if

2340
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,352
You know

2341
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,632
A lot of people in Sweden

2342
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:04,032
Do love Donald Trump

2343
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:07,872
Play examples

2344
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:15,040
Our friends shirt

2345
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:18,112
What have you

2346
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,352
I just feel

2347
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,656
It's

2348
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:35,008
It's okay I feel sorry for him but you know why he's tough

2349
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,872
And I said this was when the when I first introduced him two years ago in Phoenix

2350
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,480
It was kind of an empty platform stage if you know what I mean

2351
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:53,952
My gut tells me he'll go down as one of the greatest

2352
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:57,024
Presidents we had ever had in this country

2353
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,304
Mark my words

2354
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,584
It's all over

2355
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,888
Just reputation

2356
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:14,944
George Washington

2357
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,624
I look forward to hearing

2358
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,184
One day but that's all

2359
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,976
That's all such b*******

2360
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:28,000
That's crazy

2361
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,560
Consider your words

2362
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,656
What

2363
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,960
I mean

2364
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,544
If Trump

2365
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,408
He will go down in history as one of the best presidents

2366
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,456
Well there's a whole

2367
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:49,248
Because there will still be a hist

2368
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,832
If we don't actually solve

2369
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:55,648
There's a whole list of things that theoretically

2370
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,416
Could do

2371
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:59,232
Like he could solve the problem in the Middle East

2372
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:03,584
Call climate change could bring peace to the world

2373
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:09,984
He could take us off-planet he could bring us life-extension technology the holographic medbay

2374
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:12,032
Goodreads

2375
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,568
But they can't be.

2376
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,104
What's up with them for other reason

2377
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,640
Logistical reasons

2378
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:17,664
But other ones

2379
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,456
Or because he's not going to do them

2380
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,016
He's not going so climate change is not going to be

2381
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,832
Those things are not in his agenda

2382
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:26,368
Grandma thinks he's acting like

2383
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:28,160
He's going to do

2384
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:29,440
You can do. Really

2385
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,464
So

2386
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:31,488
It look

2387
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,512
No

2388
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:37,376
This is so f****** pathetic on Alex's part cuz all he does is talk about it like

2389
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,936
Just jacks off about the founders

2390
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:43,520
And I all this

2391
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,288
And if you

2392
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:46,336
If he doesn't know anything about history

2393
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:48,128
You can't possibly believe

2394
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,408
That Trump is going to

2395
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,432
Tubidy

2396
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:53,504
Heralded as one of the greatest president of all time

2397
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,552
How good you will be okay

2398
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:57,344
Can you hang your hat on when you say that

2399
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,624
The only reason is

2400
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,672
Because he thinks he's going to defeat the globalist

2401
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:01,952
That's it

2402
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,512
The globalist witch

2403
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,280
Again

2404
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:06,816
Has no

2405
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:07,840
Endgame

2406
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:08,608
For that

2407
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,912
Defeating globalstar doesn't

2408
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,496
It's defeating the globalist by itself doesn't

2409
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:15,264
Set up

2410
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,288
And infrastructure

2411
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:18,592
No but it does break everyone

2412
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:21,408
And then we will know

2413
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,432
The climate change

2414
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,456
Isn't real

2415
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:26,272
And we should actually be putting more CO2 out

2416
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,296
Because

2417
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:30,624
The atmosphere is carbon dioxide

2418
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,392
Deprived

2419
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,488
But it's all just a big Tech

2420
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,256
Scam

2421
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,304
Taxes and what-have-you

2422
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,424
I'll run around kids

2423
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:51,360
So that's what he's talking about he's talking about the idea that Trump is going to take down this

2424
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:53,664
Imagine group of globalist

2425
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,968
These 6,000 people is he Alex

2426
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,504
But on the show before

2427
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,296
Who are taking down the world

2428
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:02,368
And trying to depopulated it take away our sperm

2429
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:08,256
Even if you aren't even if you agree with what Trump is doing

2430
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:10,560
You have to admit that he's spectacular

2431
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,352
Regularly

2432
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,936
Even if you even if you think what Trump is doing

2433
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:18,752
Is what should be done

2434
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:21,056
He's just

2435
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:23,616
Rope-a-dope

2436
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:29,504
I don't know how well you know this dimensional chest

2437
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,552
Broca do like for real

2438
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:32,576
The fact that

2439
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:35,392
He's just doing so much

2440
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,952
All the time

2441
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:41,792
It's hard to maintain any kind of resistance to

2442
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:45,632
Desensitize to his latest

2443
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,168
Prime

2444
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,984
We haven't done anything about it

2445
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,544
Something about it later

2446
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,312
Until

2447
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
What

2448
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,360
What happened

2449
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,384
I think the

2450
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:58,688
You know it is easy to get distracted

2451
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,456
To buy whatever

2452
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:05,600
Crazyshit he does every week or so it seems like it's almost on a schedule

2453
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,392
Everyone I think

2454
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,672
Most

2455
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,208
People who

2456
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:14,048
I don't know I think a lot of people are just hoping

2457
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:14,816
That

2458
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,096
This investigation

2459
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:16,864
Is Progresso

2460
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:19,168
Going to workout

2461
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:22,496
I think we're going to have to I think we're going to have to do what they did

2462
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,264
Insole

2463
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:24,800
Duke mob

2464
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:25,568
Just

2465
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:28,384
100 million

2466
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,152
Maybe

2467
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:33,248
Martin Luther King

2468
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,272
Was

2469
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:36,576
He was going to March a million people on washing

2470
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:38,880
Holyshit

2471
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:43,488
A million people it needs to be

2472
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:48,352
I just don't know

2473
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,888
Yeah but what is it

2474
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,936
I mean I'm talking about

2475
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:54,752
Yeah really what it is

2476
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,288
We have to go there

2477
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:01,152
Occupy Wall Street

2478
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:07,808
The world we're living in now of course the National Guard will be

2479
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,600
Be called in totally

2480
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:11,648
I mean it would be a bloodbath

2481
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:13,440
Nobles need to have

2482
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,744
These militias in the

2483
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
Ditto

2484
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,280
The alt right

2485
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:18,560
Agitators

2486
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,352
To do a lot of trouble

2487
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:21,632
I don't know man

2488
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:23,424
We'll see we'll see what happens

2489
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:29,312
That we're going to skip this next court cuz I don't want I don't want to listen to Joe Arpaio anymore

2490
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,848
Just a teaser

2491
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:36,736
Like we need we need a Flashpoint we need some sort of leader like Luther King Junior

2492
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,272
We need somebody who can

2493
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,552
We need a Fred Hammond

2494
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,320
Beer

2495
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,600
We just don't

2496
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:44,160
It's Jordan now definitely not me

2497
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:50,816
I don't think I don't think people are going to Rally Millions behind a guy whose us often do on white genocide

2498
02:04:57,984 --> 02:05:03,360
I like I said I'm going to skip this next cuz it's just

2499
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,896
Eighty-five percent

2500
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,248
I care about you and write

2501
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,320
To be saying on the air

2502
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,856
You disgust

2503
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,624
Timberlake

02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,392
Is 95 /

2505
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,488
I was going to make it

2506
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,512
Sing joke

2507
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:21,536
I've had it

2508
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:27,424
In my back up there song digital get down

2509
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:31,008
Baby song

2510
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:34,592
No strings attached

2511
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:36,128
The album

2512
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:40,224
It's called digital get down and it was all about to heaven cybersec

2513
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:42,784
Outlook 2002 or something

2514
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:49,184
It's real embarrassing looking back

2515
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,744
Deflecting my experience

2516
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:55,328
2002

2517
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,096
Xx2

2518
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,376
Baby baby

2519
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:59,680
Baby baby baby baby

2520
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,704
CB

2521
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,264
There's a lot of babies in there

2522
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:06,848
They didn't have songwriters I think I did

2523
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:08,384
Sorry I meant

2524
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:10,176
I meant they were

2525
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:12,736
So that means that there's some guy

2526
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,784
Is just like Vicks baby

2527
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:24,256
Well there was also like it was as weird. Of time where people were talking about

2528
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,792
But essentially master

2529
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,560
Pretoria

2530
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:27,840
And songs a lot

2531
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:30,400
Cuz there was that other song about phone

2532
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,168
Insects

2533
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:37,568
Perhaps it was singing the song about

2534
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,848
Sex on the line

2535
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,128
Or something like that

2536
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:43,456
It was like in the same year or so

2537
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:46,272
There's digital get down and that phone sex

2538
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,552

02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:51,392
What what is a kite

2540
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:53,696
I guess to be fair let me be clear

2541
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:56,256
Digital get down was not a sick

2542
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:58,816
I did have the album

2543
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:03,424
Zeitgeist

2544
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,032
Like you were just trying to just

2545
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,824
Defy your own cyber sex

2546
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:14,432

2552
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,024
Are your safe

2553

For now

2554
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:31,584
For now

2555
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,984
Rebecca

2556
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:43,616
So

2557
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,640
Skipping this clip

2558
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:46,176
We're going to move on now.

2559
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:50,784
To post Joe Arpaio

2560
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,160
So

2561
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,952
Bios gone

2562
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:03,072
I do but his knowledge fight the podcast where Dan tries to make Jordan kill himself

2563
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:12,288
That's kind of what this podcast is

2564
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:15,360
Get down get down

2565
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:20,224
Jordan

2566
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,248
I told you

2567
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,272
Earlier

2568
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,576
There we had to remember psychic Goblin

2569
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:26,112
For these goblins

2570
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:30,208
Literal guttural Goblin

2571
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:33,792
Too much

2572
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:38,656
Literal

2573
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:40,448
Psychic

2574
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:46,336
So we're well past lord-of-the-rings territories

2575
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:48,896
Maybe

2576
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,176
Warcraft

2577
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,224
This is a mic down

2578
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:55,552
Clip because you need to get all the nuance

2579
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,904
And then it gets into Alex

2580
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:00,672
Jones

2581
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,744
Maybe almost was a globalist

2582
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:08,864
We need to hear all of it cuz it

2583
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,144
We're going to need two parts

2584
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,192
It's real f*****

2585
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,728
This clip is f*****

2586
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:15,776
Stop

2587
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,080
We are all bad

2588
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:20,896
What you want

2589
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:22,432
Is the big pardon

2590
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:27,296
Man I used to doubt that but now I've lived a long time

2591
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:29,600
Thousand Years actually

2592
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,024
Evil

2593
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:40,608
When you share the same thing out of somebody's mouth

2594
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:43,680
Same weird stuff

2595
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:46,240
And the person

2596
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:50,592
Growls at your door like this is Linda Blair this is real that's

2597
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:59,296
And a mama. Happens to you

2598
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:03,648
And somebody said something nobody knows

2599
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:09,536
Talking and smiling

2600
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:13,888
And they just said something nobody knows you're like what the hell's going on

2601
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,296
Kid

2602
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,392
Let's

2603
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,184
Corrupt child

2604
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:39,232
Have sex with a child

2605
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,024
Abused your child

2606
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:43,072
Kill your child

2607
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,680
Only

2608
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:58,432
What's your name

2609
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:05,088
The movie of the remake of a

2610
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:13,280
Or he's going to live until

2611
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:16,096
He's alive because great returning out the operation

2612
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:20,704
I've talked to people and I

2613
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:26,336
Experience it was younger and almost went that direction

2614
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:30,432
Dennis like everything quite hot everything slow motion

2615
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:32,480
An older is a

2616
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:40,160
Little glimpse

2617
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,632
Tortured

2618
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:00,896
Drug

2619
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:04,992
But other than that

2620
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:15,744
Hardcore bands basically

2621
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:16,768
Criminology

2622
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,048
And

2623
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:27,008
Something is seduced by the dark side

2624
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,312
Fullback

2625
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:31,104
What

2626
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,640
What's

2627
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,176
Men go to work

2628
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,480
Seduced by the dark side

2629
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:44,928
I was hoping you would understand

2630
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,720
Was it just

2631
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:48,000
Was it

2632
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:54,656
You're looking for the big

2633
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:55,680
Right

2634
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,728
That's the reprieve

2635
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:02,592
Then there are people who know things in different cities so you know that it's true

2636
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:06,944
Do they do the same thing which might behave

2637
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,736
F*** you Alex

2638
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:13,600
I hope that means out there here in multiple cities

2639
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:14,624
Right

2640
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,648
There Linda Blair

2641
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:22,048
Okay telling you things

2642
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:28,448
Months before anybody knows another front but information is from like a month ago and nobody knows it

2643
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,984
Like you stole the cookie

2644
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:30,752
Or something like that

2645
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:36,384
Okay alrighty

2646
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:37,920
Before anybody else

2647
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:42,528
Okay. It's something from the past

2648
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:46,112
They look like goblins and they're saying we're going to get you

2649
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:48,672
This is schizophrenia

2650
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:52,256
No

2651
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,048
These are all leftist

2652
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,328
Right of course

2653
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:57,888
And again I'm sorry the thing cut out

2654
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:00,192
When he's talking about the leftist

2655
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:00,960
Yeah there's

2656
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:03,520
The left

2657
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:04,544
Our fallen

2658
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,336
They all know this

2659
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:09,920
They'll know this stuff

2660
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,944
We all know

2661
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,248
Literal psychic

2662
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,528
Antoine's

2663
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:18,112
And clothes with five different and we are all sick

2664
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,392
Okay

2665
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:23,488
Why are we doing this again

2666
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:25,024
Because we're falling I don't know

2667
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:33,472
No doubt that's still not why good men go to war and get seduced by the dark side

2668
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:38,336
Children

2669
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:40,640
The Goblins are really let off there

2670
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:45,504
Jeff is when they get to torture with the introduction

2671
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:48,320
Transition between

2672
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,112
Goblin

2673
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:52,928
Only feel comfortable in their abuser

2674
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:56,000
And then

2675
02:14:56,256 --> 02:15:00,096
Right

2676
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:04,448
This is what I want to talk a little bit more about is that idea that Alex

2677
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:06,752
Almost went down the path

2678
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,592
Because I don't think it was Denzel's

2679
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:11,360
Choice

2680
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:13,664
To be your man

2681
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,456
I think it was

2682
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,224
To him

2683
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:16,992
I mean

2684
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:18,016
Don't bring

2685
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,296
Don't bring

2686
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,576
That

2687
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:26,976
Reality do this

2688
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:28,256
I haven't seen the remake

2689
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:30,048
But

2690
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:31,072
The same plot

2691
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:32,096
He's being mine

2692
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:35,168
Control

2693
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:36,448
General killed

2694
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,032
Must believe that it's some point he was subject

2695
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:41,312
To mind control

2696
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:43,616
Possibly

2697
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:45,920
No I think he has to believe that

2698
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:49,248
He could have gone along with it but Broke Free

2699
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:52,320
Cuz he saw all the things

2700
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:54,112
So what he's really saying

2701
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:58,464
Is that all the good men who go to war and then get seduced by the dark side

2702
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:03,584
When he was a child okay

2703
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,376
Bright

2704
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,656
Now that we know this

2705
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:11,264
Everybody who is good that goes into the military is

2706
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:15,872
Right and they they get said they are all bigots seduced

2707
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:19,200
He describes it as a bright light

2708
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:23,040
Full bright light

2709
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,832
This is

2710
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,368
Insane

2711
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:27,904
This is

2712
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:28,928
Schizophrenic

2713
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:30,464
Hallucinations

2714
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:33,280
Basically being described

2715
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:36,864
This is not

2716
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,632
Any other ex

2717
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:43,008
And we're getting back to the end of the March 30th episode

2718
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:47,616
Yeah like his tone is changing

2719
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:50,176
There's also this oversharing

2720
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:56,320
As usual right but I mean like this stuff he shouldn't be saying stuff like this on the air

2721
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:58,880
This is this is really easy to see through like

2722
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,160
You got those of the deep

2723
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:05,536
You're not using Browns because of it you're not using metaphorical language

2724
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,816
You really think that

2725
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:10,144
Yeah this is something you believe there are

2726
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:12,448
Psychic goblins that are coming up

2727
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:13,728
Do you and threatening you

2728
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:16,032
That is something that

2729
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:17,568
I think is relevant

2730
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:22,688
To his listeners I think they should understand that this is a crazy person

2731
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,480
That they're listening to

2732
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:25,504
And

2733
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,064
If you want to listen to crazy person for entertainment

2734
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:28,832
God bless you

2735
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:31,136
I watched a lot of Steve-O videos in my day

2736
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:32,160
That's fine

2737
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:39,840
Value of someone who has

2738
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,864
A little bit

2739
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,400
But most of

2740
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:43,680
To be fair

2741
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:47,264
If you're going to be listen

2742
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:48,288
Coming to a guy

2743
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:50,080
Who believes their psychic

2744
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:50,848
Goblin

2745
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:52,384
You're running around and attack

2746
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,408
Or threatening

2747
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:56,480
Ain't that a lot of people who disagree with him or

2748
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,248
Clones

2749
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:58,528
With five parents

2750
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:00,832
Better

2751
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:03,136
They got no soul baby they got no soul

2752
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:04,928
I would suggest

2753
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:08,512
Don't take political advice from that guy

2754
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:09,536
Also

2755
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:12,096
Don't take economic advice from that guy

2756
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:13,120
Also

2757
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,912
Don't buy

2758
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:17,472
His off-brand herbs and pills

2759
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:21,056
Oh did you see that

2760
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:24,896
Great and great course weekend

2761
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:25,920
Of course we do

2762
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:26,944
Course

2763
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,224
Beyond

2764
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,784
I really need to impress upon people

2765
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:33,600
This guy is not a political pundit

2766
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:35,648
You may never have been

2767
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,440
But boy he is not now

2768
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,488
Drunk

2769
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:43,072
Probably mentally ill f****** lunatic

2770
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:46,144
And I would not use those words about someone else who

2771
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,912
Struggling

2772
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:47,936
But because he's such a

2773
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:51,264
Dick people like Alexander Dugan

2774
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,568
And Joe Arpaio on his show

2775
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,360
Pretty fine calling him a f****** loot

2776
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:56,128
Dickweed

2777
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:57,664
So

2778
02:18:58,688 --> 02:19:02,272
I don't know as as a mentally ill person

2779
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:05,600
Usually trying to

2780
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:06,368
Take the side

2781
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:09,440
There's a lot of stuff that

2782
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:14,304
Do that

2783
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:16,864
Alex

2784
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:24,288
I wonder like I wonder about that I wonder

2785
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:25,824
About the brain damage

2786
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:27,872
May or may not be there

2787
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:31,200
Dr. group

2788
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:33,760
What was the last time

2789
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:38,624
A medical professional

2790
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,416
When was the last time

2791
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:43,488
Somebody obtained a medical degree

2792
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:45,536
University

2793
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:47,840
Song Alex

2794
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:50,912
Like on the street I just looked him in the eye

2795
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,496
Alex Jones sitting on that little paper on the table

2796
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:56,288
Yeah I would

2797
02:19:57,568 --> 02:20:02,432
Actually I want to see you I want to see the physical result

2798
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:04,480
Two kind of bait Alex into suing

2799
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:11,136
I'll be fine because if he did in Discovery I think we could demand video of a psych evaluation

2800
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:12,160
Probable

2801
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:18,560
Well I mean I guess in his divorce or the custody battle they had a psych evaluation the lady said that he has like a narcissist

2802
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:19,328
6 personalities

2803
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,096
Disorder

2804
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:23,680
No I unless it was entirely about the show

2805
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:25,728
Cuz if it's about the show then we can

2806
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:26,496
Use clips

2807
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:28,544
Right cuz it was in the divorce

2808
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:29,312
They couldn't use the

2809
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:33,920
Well no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm trying to find ways

2810
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:35,456
There we could trick him into going

2811
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:40,576
Because even though I hate him and even though I do

2812
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:43,136
I think he's done a lot of damage to the world I think if he

2813
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,416
Got treatment

2814
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:45,184
You might

2815
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:45,952
Be happier

2816
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:53,888
I think we got on actual meds and went out of his pills like antipsychotics

2817
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:58,496
Like I I wonder if you would be as focused on these imaginary globulus

2818
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:00,032
If you was getting

2819
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:03,616
Like if you was actually on the medication he clearly needs

2820
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:05,664
He wouldn't be seeing literal Goblin

2821
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,432
Buns everywhere

2822
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:13,088
He probably would still have terrible reading comprehension skills

2823
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:20,256
But he probably wouldn't be demons all over the

2824
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:22,304
Probably

2825
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:23,328
Go to

2826
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:31,776
Call me we wouldn't have a show so that's

2827
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:35,360
2 triangle

2828
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:39,456
Maybe you could have stayed just being crazy

2829
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:42,272
Government Ranger

2830
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:44,576
That is not funny enough

2831
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:48,416
Lap dancing

2832
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:50,464
Joe Rogan for all his faults

2833
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,512
I think one of the main reasons he's having these

2834
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:53,280
These people on

2835
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:55,584
Sincere curiosity

2836
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,608
About this

2837
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:58,144
Group

2838
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,424
That everyone hates

2839
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,264
Hey the unfortunate thing is he is curiosity is leading him to validate

2840
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:04,288
As opposed to

2841
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:06,336
Understand why everyone hates

2842
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:08,640
Instead of doing that he could

2843
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:10,944
They wrote

2844
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,992
That would be helpful if you did some research

2845
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:15,040
But be that as it may be a few more clips

2846
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:17,600
Are f******

2847
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,624
End of the night

2848
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,392
Sad

2849
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:21,184
F***** up drunk

2850
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,208
Just like

2851
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:23,744
Running out of gas Alex

2852
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,768
This is

2853
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:26,048
4 ways to learn Alec

2854
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:26,816
Text Tootsie

2855
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:29,376
This first one is

2856
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:31,936
First one is

2857
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:34,240
That is really sad

2858
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:41,152
I'm almost ashamed but if you only turned loose

2859
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:47,552
My job's a lot easier, Florida gun so much

2860
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:50,368
Cella Vista supplements

2861
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:55,488
I will. I'm your body can absorb

2862
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,024
Text to

2863
02:22:57,536 --> 02:23:02,912
Yesterday I got a ride who's taking over Owen Shroyer

2864
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,960
I left that in

2865
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:05,728
Even though it's

2866
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,032
You know irrelevant to our

2867
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:12,128
Just because Owen Shroyer will come back up blast clip

2868
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:13,152
In one of the

2869
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:14,176
Satisfy

2870
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:15,456
Chances of ever heard Alex

2871
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:16,480
That was

2872
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:17,504
That looks rough

2873
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,528
That was brutal

2874
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:20,832
And if people think that I'm just

2875
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:24,928
Well one of the things to his whenever I

2876
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:26,720
Some of it

2877
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:28,000
Applications that I give

2878
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:28,768
AR

2879
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:30,304
This sort of s***

2880
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:39,264
And then also he was drinking out of a suspicious cup

2881
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:40,800
During the show

2882
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:44,384
Gotcha generally he'll have a coffee mug or something like that

2883
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,408
He had a wife

2884
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:46,176
Paper cup

2885
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:47,968
Oh that's that's the cop

2886
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:51,808
Well I mean I don't know doesn't really prove anything but it is

2887
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,344
What is a little

2888
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:55,392
I don't know

2889
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:56,160
Anyway

2890
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:58,976
F****** bummer

2891
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:01,280
The end of his 3 hours

2892
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:04,352
Owen Shroyer

2893
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:11,008
Actually don't think it's Owen sure I think Paul Joseph Watson hours

2894
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:12,032
PJ dubs

2895
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:14,080
This

2896
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:16,640
Is profoundly sad

2897
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:18,432
It is a bummer

2898
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:22,528
I still hate him I don't give him any

2899
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:24,832
Leeway

2900
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:25,856
As it were

2901
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:27,392
But

2902
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,416
Susie says

2903
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:31,232
In relation to Owen Shroyer like I said

2904
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:32,768
Is

2905
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:35,840
You'll see

2906
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,800
7-Eleven

2907
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:49,664
Sorry I forgot that he was going to play the entire

2908
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:52,992
97 minutes

2909
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:58,112
75 minutes

2910
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:06,816
From the top here cuz you got it you got a f****** here though

2911
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:16,032
Shroyer

2912
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:21,664
Come on play the

2913
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:24,480
Comment on them talk about him get them all in

2914
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:32,160
I want to play the clips I haven't always Great Clips are so important and I don't get to him

2915
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,720
That's all coming up next hour

2916
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:39,328
Infowars.com has wallet posted newswars.com

2917
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:44,448
Infowarsstore.com

2918
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:47,776
We are

2919
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:49,824
Doing pretty good

2920
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:52,384
But my gut tells me I've got a sue

2921
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:56,992
Cuz they're cutting everybody else offered up with her

2922
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:01,344
Go for a job doing okay right now then I'm giving into him so I got to fight him

2923
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,112
Start soon

2924
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,648
Please looking for a fight

2925
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:06,464
You know what you're a bossy upside ahead I'm going to get you

2926
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:12,096
Open

2927
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:25,664
They're coming back yet

2928
02:26:27,712 --> 02:26:32,576
I just want to make sure my heart keeps popping all the way

2929
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,048
And as long as you financially supported

2930
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:46,144
Realize that there are articles are videos

2931
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:49,216
Cars

2932
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:51,520
Is victory over this trash

2933
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:54,336
We're not just doing it

2934
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:56,384
That is so wonderful

2935
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:02,528
The marketplace of ideas

2936
02:27:03,552 --> 02:27:06,112
Global to come after us because

2937
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:20,960
What's the devil do

2938
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,848
Give Network

2939
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:36,064
Basement

2940
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:49,376
That's so sad

2941
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:51,424
Like he thinks either

2942
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:52,960
You think he's John Wayne

2943
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:53,984
In a cowboy boot

2944
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:56,288
Don't be like me

2945
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:57,824
You're right I'm just

2946
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:05,760
You got to be a better man than me Andre well there's got to be a better man

2947
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:08,576
But then

2948
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:11,392
I think that there's actually a difference. Going on

2949
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:13,184
Yeah I think he wants

2950
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:13,952
To look like

2951
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:15,232
But Woody's

2952
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,512
Actually saying

2953
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:19,328
If you look at what he says immediately after

2954
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:22,912
Gift telling Owen Shroyer don't be bad at your job

2955
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:26,752
The Pointe at Owen Shroyer

2956
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:28,288
Don't play the clipse

2957
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,568
Take the calls

2958
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:34,432
I've been on I've been on the air for 3 hours

2959
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:37,760
And I've mostly just drunkenly rambled about the devil

2960
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:40,832
I said I was going to play a bunch of trump clips

2961
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:44,416
I said I was going to take that one anti-semite

2962
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:45,952
I don't know what was going on

2963
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:48,768
Don't be like me

2964
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:50,816
Be better at your job

2965
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:51,840
But I think there's even a

2966
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:53,632
Further subtext of it

2967
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:55,424
Cuz what he does immediately after

2968
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,216
Is going to a sad f******

2969
02:28:57,472 --> 02:28:57,984
Sales pitch

2970
02:28:58,496 --> 02:28:59,520
That also involved

2971
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:00,544
We're doing pretty good

2972
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:03,872
Also saying is

2973
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:05,408
Don't be like me

2974
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:08,480
I have to run around trying to get all this money to

2975
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:09,504
The fight the globalist

2976
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:15,904
Be a newsman Owen Shroyer be like water filters from Big Berkey

2977
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:20,000
Did to make the bills come together don't do that

2978
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:21,024
Fight

2979
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,560
Fight to the news fight

2980
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:25,120
I can't do it I don't have the skills

2981
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:26,656
Spoiler alert neither Zone Troy

2982
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:28,448
Woody's

2983
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,472
I think what he's saying is

2984
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:32,544
He's really internalizing the fact that he is just

2985
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,568
A f****** sales

2986
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:35,616
That all he does

2987
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:39,200
Get up and make it up

2988
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:40,736
Scream but the globalist

2989
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:42,016
Wanting to take your children

2990
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:44,832
To scare you just enough to keep you around

2991
02:29:45,088 --> 02:29:46,368
So he can f****** sell uShip

2992
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:48,416
And I think

2993
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:52,768
I think he realizes that I think he realizes that his role is not

2994
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,560
Trusted respected news person

2995
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:57,376
F****** talk about any news past the headlines

2996
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:58,656
So he knows

2997
02:29:59,168 --> 02:29:59,680
Think it hurts them

2998
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:00,448
I didn't this

2999
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:02,240
F****** end of the show

3000
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,520
Noon drunk

3001
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:06,336
But I think he's just getting like

3002
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:09,152
Don't do it this way

3003
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:14,784
Don't do it this way

3004
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,064
He's still just like

3005
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:17,600
Cost

3006
02:30:17,856 --> 02:30:18,880
Logan Logan all my my

3007
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:20,672
Look at all of it Owen

3008
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:21,696
You'll never have it

3009
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,232
But look at it

3010
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:24,512
You don't want it

3011
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,072
All the money in the world doesn't

3012
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:27,840
Thank you for respecting

3013
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,656
The truth

3014
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:32,960
I have no soul baby

3015
02:30:33,984 --> 02:30:35,520
Ain't got no soul

I don't care

3019
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:43,200
So

3020
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:45,504
Usually usually I can find

3021
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,040
Some kind of sympathy in these

3022
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:50,624
Whenever we've cuz there's always that Whiplash whenever we do some of these words

3023
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:52,928
I hope you get

3024
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:56,256

Shell of a man

Midget retard

3032
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:15,456
Two words

3033
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:16,480
That

3034
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:17,504
Shouldn't be

3035
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:20,320
Used

3036
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:22,112
Offensive

3037
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:24,416
Singularly

3038
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:25,952
And horrific

3039
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:26,976
Back to

3040
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:33,632
Covering for his biggest political Ally who goes around and called everyone negro

3041
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:39,520

02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:41,312

Signifies that

3060
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:27,904

3061
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:30,464
