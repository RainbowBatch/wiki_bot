1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:08,960
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,104
Bricknowlogy beverages

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,664
Drones

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,480
Maybe maybe a lot

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,856
Is there a reason people would listen to that other than just liked

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
Two dudes

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
Hatred of Alex Bell

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
No

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
There is to know about Alec

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:37,376
The show was just we don't know if neither of us have any idea what's up with him

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,312
No it's neither of those thing I know a lot about Alex Jones

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,360
We are going to

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
To be doing

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
Stated time travel episode

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Cuz

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,504
Donator has requested

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,856
Us not to do so so we get to take a break from our normal rigmarole bulshit

18
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,648
And get into the good stuff

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
Phuc yea

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256
Take a second to talk a little bit about the events that have

21
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
Transpired

22
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
I in the world of Alex Jones

23
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
Since we last recorded

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Not sure why

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,288
A video went viral

26
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,200
Fantastic debate last night you and I

27
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
About whether or not

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
That was real

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
Then a lot of people seem to think it was

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
My position on it is it's

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
The argument the people have that it was fake is that a guy

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Ends up throwing the coffee on

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Is a wrestler

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Is not enough to convince me

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Not at all

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
Thrill is because

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Empire video

38
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
He is trying to pick fights with strangers on

39
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,176
Someone throwing coffee on him is kind of a reasonable outcome

40
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
Further

41
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
And

42
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
If he is a wrestling promoter that

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Could mean that he's hired to

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
To do that or could just mean

45
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
He's the type of guy who

46
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
Willing to start some

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
He's a weirdo

48
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
Possible

49
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
Play it up as he got hit with like

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,936
Fiery hot coffee

51
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,776
So it's either boiling hot coffee

52
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
Adrenaline is so jacked up

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
From like

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
I know I'm going to try and pick a fight with

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
With the stranger

56
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Bored

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
It was tepid coffee

58
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
He's the guy from us play

59
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
I don't encourage people to assault Alex

60
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
I think I still think it's funny

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
But I don't think it's the right things

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
To do

63
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Is much better

64
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Construct is b******* world

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
How I would respond

66
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
We haven't

67
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
We don't have enough information

68
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Vision yet to confirm

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
Nor deny whether or not

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,280
So I am going to give a

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
But you can do that if you want but we're holding off on it

72
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Condition

73
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Hopefully he's not fake

74
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Call Mary mobile

75
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
Just to make sure that his name is out there it is

76
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
Yeah it's gotten out there

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,720
We don't have a scoop

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:48,608
Do I'd like to give an updated policy

79
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
For someone who has donated

80
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Donate generously

81
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
He has request

82
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
If you want

83
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,968
Not even foreign policy walk at all

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Level of policy wonk

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
Might be you're officially a

86
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Protocol one

87
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
Thank you very much for donating you can go

88
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
There we go now

89
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,751
The business

90
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
We are going to

91
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
To be going over

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Episode

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Of Alex Jones

94
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
This show from January 7th

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
2011

96
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Because

97
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
We got a new policy walk who donated on the time-travel level

98
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,135
I like to give a shout out to him

99
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
So Charles got in touch with me it is

100
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
To cover a specific app

101
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Episodes but felt it was a long shot

102
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,823
Because it isn't 2011 it sort of outside of the

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
The database that I'm pulling from

104
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Yes I did

105
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
String

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Doug Ducey

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Deep-diving

108
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,087
I don't know

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
YouTube

110
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
Some poorly labeled

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Episodes

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
And I found this episode

113
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,119
God I did cuz this s*** is wild

114
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
He's at all what happens

115
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
But you're going to love this ride

116
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
You know it's the

117
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
The beginning of the year

118
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
2011

119
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,711
Everything is good

120
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
Coming around the Sun

121
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
The Earth has survived

122
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Looking in

123
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
See what was going on in the world

124
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
At that time

125
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
What is Alex Smith

126
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
It wasn't a big news big news day around

127
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
One of his primary narrative

128
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Is about supposed bombing

129
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
They took place in

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
The day before

131
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
Supposed cuz I looked it up I found an article about it

132
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
From the article

133
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
A message

134
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
Incendiary devices that were mailed to

135
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
To Maryland State office

136
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
You complained about Homeland Security roadside

137
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Estate

138
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,655
According to a government official with access to information on the investigation

139
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
Maryland employees suffered slightly burned fingers when they open

140
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
Packages containing devices

141
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
That set off a flash of fire smoke and sulfur

142
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Zoe

143
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
It's f***** up

144
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Because they were being sent

145
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
Martin O'Malley's office was one of them

146
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
Directions to the Maryland Department

147
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Transportation office

148
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
So it is backed up

149
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
People are sending

150
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Maybe offensive thing

151
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
2

152
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
But in the end it wasn't a big deal cuz they were poorly constructed and they ended up just slightly burning

153
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Zoo

154
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
It's not the biggest deal in the world

155
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
The full-on bomb or was it like

156
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
The guy was sending

157
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
Was it was it like

158
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
Shootout bang here's what I would say about that

159
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
If someone were trying to

160
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Descend

161
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Aunt bomb

162
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
It would be counterproductive to include

163
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Because that would

164
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Soap

165
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
Tumi

166
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
It was kind of a flashback

167
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
Tension

168
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
A company is at

169
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,175
I don't think it's necessarily the biggest deal in the world

170
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
He was angry about signs

171
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
Here's a quote from the note

172
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Report

173
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
Suspicious activity total b*******

174
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
You've created a self-fulfilling prophecy

175
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
Please man but like to see something say something say

176
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
Sovereign citizen

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
Alex

178
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
We got to

179
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Little bit of a take on this

180
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
About whether or not it's fake

181
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Kathy's dealing with

182
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,063
Yeah

183
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Huge bong

184
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,159
He's dealing with it in presenting it as like this

185
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Is

186
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Very serious

187
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
As opposed

188
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
To flashback

189
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Give

190
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
Has too many whistleblowers

191
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
.

192
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
And that's the real Mark of this

193
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,559
Housing almost no news on this

194
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
I'm going to step in

195
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
That

196
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,039
Attacks

197
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
Real terror attacks

198
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Like a dinosaur

199
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,655
Police

200
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
And have tried to release it

201
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
So Alex is

202
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,519
If you want to parse what he's saying there

203
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
He think there's not a lot of media attention being given to this

204
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
And the reason for that is one of two things

205
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Either

206
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,343
Very helpful

207
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,511
There's a 90% chance that either real or fake

208
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
There's something entirely new probably space

209
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
I don't I don't

210
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,263
Schrodinger's cat that other 10% means

211
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
It could be both same time absolutely

212
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
So

213
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Just a good sense of like

214
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
His analytical skills

215
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
His career

216
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
Which is great I love it he's been on the air for like 17 years ago

217
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
I'm a bath

218
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
She's got is

219
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,207
And weird language

220
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Truism

221
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
But

222
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
Luke most of this episode is pretty weak

223
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
It's pretty soft

224
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Like I would say

225
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Two-thirds of the episode

226
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Is

227
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Entirely ignorable

228
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
And that the other third

229
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
Is outrageously amazing

230
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,359
Covering a ton of stuff

231
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
He breaks down how like

232
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,575
Is admitting the fluoride bad for you

233
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
To talk about

234
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Carnival

235
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
But

236
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
This is super fast

237
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Because the

238
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
These episodes

239
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Are full episode

240
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
They don't have the commercials taken out

241
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Like the rebroadcast

242
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Dude that I

243
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Okay

244
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
To hear what he was advertising in 2011

245
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Before he

246
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
He got really successful

247
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
Because now

248
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
All his commercials are for basically just his product

249
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
But in 2011

250
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
He was still working on

251
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
2 pecan Ave

252
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
Oh s***

253
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
Super f***** up

254
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
And here is the first one

255
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Wild

256
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
Introducing electronic cigarettes

257
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
There's no flame no secondhand smoke

258
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,599
Commercial

259
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
There's a new way to smoke

260
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
First of all starting a commercial with smoke

261
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Sol Vape

262
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Brandy cigarette

263
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
Commercial

264
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
Cuz we never lied.

265
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,527
Commercial is where we're starting commercial stuff

266
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
I'm so blown away by this commercial

267
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,999
Episode Alex wants to celebrities a little bit

268
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
Here's his take on somebody

269
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Some names were going to record

270
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
So I'm he's lying

271
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,239
Does he does he give it a week research Texas long as it takes

272
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Really were talking about 30 to 45

273
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,919
Slime

274
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
But

275
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Back then

276
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
That's a pretty restrained version of Alec

277
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,111
True now I don't think Brad Pitt is a fan

278
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
I don't think so I don't know

279
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Put it on Sandra Bullock

280
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Call Bell

281
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
Surprising

282
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
To me though.

283
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
To hear like

284
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
Nowadays modern Alex

285
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
Would be talking about Angelina Jolie drinking blood in ritual

286
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
The fact that he's like

287
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,967
Illuminati movies

288
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Like that's

289
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,575
Crazy

290
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Talking about

291
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,951
Mr. and mrs. Smith whenever they finally got

292
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
Ring 11

293
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
I think it's because

294
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
You heading up like you an issue

295
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
Baps to Irvine

296
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,687
A river runs through

297
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,759
Right possibly

298
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,855
Not good I made a real big deal out of how much I loved 7 years in

299
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Tibet when I was younger

300
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
I don't know if I stand by that Proclamation

301
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
I remember being

302
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
Pretty good what's the one where he's on the ship after he gets them really really long hair

303
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
No no no it's not

304
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,847
1800

305
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:19,295
Another commercial

306
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:34,143
Anonymously

307
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Dot-com

308
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
Define compare Realtors anonymously

309
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Do that

310
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,959
Well 14 like something he would say

311
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
But it would be about

312
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
It wouldn't be for like

313
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Do you know

314
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
75 bucks or whatever

315
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
Do you know what I think he missed his calling

316
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
He's good if you didn't have the baggage of having listened

317
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
Hunter the voices glass

318
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
Sugar instantly clicks into my head bigotry

319
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Soho

320
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Home game.com

321
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
I looked into this a little bit

322
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
We're living in now

323
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,431
Perfect

324
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
I've booked into the protocols of the Elders of Zion

325
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,575
12

326
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:03,999
It makes me what it is is a website where they have a bunch of Realtors who are paying for their service

327
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
To be linked up with

328
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
People

329
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
To get

330
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Leaves and

331
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Propose

332
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
People

333
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,263
Give their experiences by product

334
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
Stop

335
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Is it

336
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
I know that's what you think

337
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
A lot of the responses are

338
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Home games.com is a waste

339
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:33,695
Sometime I received a lot of fake emails I do not recommend

340
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
Anyone using the service

341
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Here's another one

342
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
I have had home game for 3 months

343
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
I've done

344
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
6 quote-unquote proposal

345
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Weather the prospect

346
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
4info

347
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
Not one has even opened my

348
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Proposal

349
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Rejected it

350
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Never even even open

351
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
I think it's a way

352
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
That's pretty much the trend of

353
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,735
Alex Jones is just Hawking weirdo scam product

354
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Yeah Alec Baldwin

355
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Be happy with the web

356
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Website

357
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Vapes

358
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
Damn home owner home

359
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
What is the weather supposed to be

360
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
Ritsuko Realtors

361
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,447
Realtors who signed into

362
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,567
Use their service

363
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
A house or supposed

364
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Go to home game

365
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
To be matched with these Realtors

366
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Who are paying

367
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
Of whatever

368
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
The service

369
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Extremity

370
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Who's running home

371
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,023
I don't know

372
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Venture capitalist

373
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
Vince Venture scam artist

374
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
But I would assume

375
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,263
Who's on the show

376
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
The other is Charlie is

377
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Naughty real name

378
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Apparently

379
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
White House

380
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Charlotte Charlotte

381
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Charlotte iserbyt

382
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
So one of the things that she wants to talk about is that

383
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
Intentionally Reagan was dumbing-down the school

384
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
Debatable

385
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,543
Everyone is a globalist

386
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Just basically

387
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Her conception

388
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663

00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,903
The show as being the right-wing version of the Council on Foreign Relations

393
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
Okay

394
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511

Very much so Alex

397
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
Trying to push her down that aisle

398
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079

Do I join her to get out of the UN

407
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,023
And no one responded to her and that proves that they're all globalist

408
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
It's while

409
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351

00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:33,663
If it's not a real date clips

414
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
Cuz she keeps order going down weird path

415
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Screw in 2011

This is the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Union

422
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319

Episode

435
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528

But

452
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280

454
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
Not afraid

460
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
2

461
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Really make

462
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Clear

463
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,368
That he is a front for a goal.

464
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,488
In-N-Out now being like well he doesn't talk about it

465
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Ever now

466
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
He doesn't talk about what

467
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072

468
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Communications Network

469
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
He doesn't talk about how Midas resources

470
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,496
Is owned by the same company that

471
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520

473
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
Right never talked

474
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
You needed to hide

475
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Nearly as much

476
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
And on this show they have a straight-up

477
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Commercial for Midas

478
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
Important

479
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
Specialist

480
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
Postal Services

888

486
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824

And remember

490
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
Let's see if this is still an operating phone number

491
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
You better remember to say your on the

492
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
This is freaking me out

493
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
Are you a business pick up

494
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
Saturday I don't know what's right off of that

495
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
This is going nowhere

496
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,400
And what are we going to do we want silver

497
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,288
I just want to see if a number with your real I also will I know his voice

498
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,640
And automated

499
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
So he has his own

500
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Message

501
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
Alex

502
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,120
Really thought about that commercial and what it was illustrative

503
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
There is there's

504
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,960
Basically because it's

505
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
To retard

506
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
50 Cent

507
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
Kind of

508
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,016
10 CDs for a penny operation

509
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
I theme

510
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
It seems good but is a scam

511
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
I still owe those people like 7

512
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
$7,000

513
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
I probably do

514
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,608
But the good news is that we were doing it when we were like 12

515
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Select on 12th

516
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
You can't find a contractor or anything like that

517
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
But

518
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Be that as it may

519
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,248
Calls in 2011 than he is now

520
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
He clearly has a little bit better attention

521
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
But

522
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
He gets this call

523
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Exposes him

524
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
Terribly

525
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
And I don't think you realize

526
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
Alex Waterbury

527
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,680
Real quick anyway

528
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
And I don't really want to put any more money in the bank through hands I was wondering if you could recommend a good local bank

529
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,504
Local bank

530
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,904
Call Bank in Armada

531
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
Research

532
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
Looks like

533
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
But you can pull up

534
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,456
Texas Top Texas

535
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
Which ones are the best customer service

536
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,744
Local credit unions are great

537
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Visual advice

538
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,240
Bulshit

539
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
Is it bites with Google it but

540
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
This guy is calling

541
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,016
If you believe the things that he professes to believe wouldn't have a

542
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Pretty good under

543
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Understanding of what banks were globalist

544
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
And which ones were cool

545
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
That's bulshit

546
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
And where's that

547
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:19,840
Loophole scam going on

548
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:24,192
Of course

549
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,080
I don't like to give people Financial advice

550
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Is b*******

551
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,224
He plays commercials on his show for a gold silver sale operation

552
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Is not fine a

553
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
It is life advice

554
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
That's fair

555
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Your life by this rule

556
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Buy gold

557
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:47,232
Constantly talks about like Financial collapse

558
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
The dollar is going to go

559
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
I believe

560
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Could be interpreted as Finance

561
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
I don't know

562
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
Leave the financial cyst

563
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
Chick-fil-A

564
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,272
Google whether or not the world is going to end about 2 or 3 weeks at the end

565
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
Summer of Rage

566
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
It's right around it

567
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
It's my favorite season

568
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,464
Right before the fall

569
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
That's a good one

570
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Because the leaves change

571
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Lottery

572
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
Beautiful colors

573
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,192
Just like angry just like Alex

574
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
So

575
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Up to this point replacing weird commercials

576
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Super weird

577
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
This Mix commercial

578
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
Made me blurt laugh at the office

579
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,040
I was sitting there listening to it and everyone stared at me like

580
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,856
But because I was blown away by

581
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
I'd first volcano

582
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
It is a real thing

583
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,048
I can't believe the problem it's

584
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
Purporting to solve his real

585
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
It's just layers upon layers of

586
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Volume

587
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,520
Bite down on this one cuz it's that weird

588
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,344
Going through the roof and that means

589
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,744
Powerful Secrets

590
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
Make the perfect

591
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,344
Stop

592
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,744
Hi georgia.com

593
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,040
Under any

594
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:34,400
George waiting outside but don't hide it underneath the park

595
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,728
Seems too good idea given the circumstances but that's cuz you're a fool

596
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
You don't understand what I've done

597
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,920
Look if you're that good I can maybe you should write another book that says

598
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,480
How to hide your book from people trying to shut it down

599
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
This is about making weapons

600
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,856
About like

601
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,464
Noah shirts

602
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
Is legally dicey

603
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
Don't hide them

604
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
In your underwear

605
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
Don't do that

606
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
No

607
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Hide it in the zoo

608
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,664
So why stay on the topic

609
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
While we're on the topic of gun

610
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Fun stuff I wanted to

611
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
To bring this up

612
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,368
I just saw an article that came out of Stanford study

613
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Just came out

614
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
Alex always talks about how more guns

615
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
People more safe

616
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:43,008
It's a philosophy that people on the right really believe in they believe it's that good guy with a gun

617
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,544
Sort of mentality of course

618
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
And

619
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
How's Revis off

620
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,176
States with right to carry concealed handgun laws

621
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Experience

622
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
Increases and violent crime

623
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
To Stanford scholar

624
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,552
Stanford law school professor

625
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
You found the states that adopted right to carry laws

626
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Have experience

627
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
To 15%

628
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Violent crime

629
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,000
In the Ten Years After in a

630
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
When over f****** data for a deck

631
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
Information

632
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Be found

633
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
And compared them to

634
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
Right to carry

635
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
Have you found

636
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
Entirely

637
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,176
Well Countrywide crime has been going

638
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Has been going down

639
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
70

640
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
So

641
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
If you see a long increase

642
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,280
You're f****** up percent

643
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Increase

644
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
That's a 10%

645
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Increase

646
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
On top of

647
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Decrease

648
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
20%

649
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
215

650
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,224
That comes from this analysis

651
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
That's fine

652
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,880
Let's just illustrative

653
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
Mythology that RG

654
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
4shared

655
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
AIDS from Stanford

656
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
Liberal bass Samurai

657
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Of course

658
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:18,752
Take your guns away. Even though I acknowledge that that is entirely true

659
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
I still don't think that people should ever go

660
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
I just want to be clear

661
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
In case there are any Alex Jones

662
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
They know how to hide them

663
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,832
I also like violent criminals

664
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
Coming for your guns because gun prices are so hot I like that that's the presentation of it it's not that like

665
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,584
The government is coming violent criminals who are just like

666
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
I wish I could

667
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,704
You get a gun but I can't afford 130 bucks off

668
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,800
Can't afford it I got to go commit a peony

669
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
But yeah

670
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
That commercial

671
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,712
Now I want you to I want you to know looking for a gun

672
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
Why would you go to summer

673
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
House has a lot of guns

674
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:08,928
That's just bad at that's just a bad idea cuz generally you can assume that they haven't read the

675
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Facebook

676
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,280
Do no not every gun owner knows where to hide gun

677
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,096
So they're just going to have it in a safe

678
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Or something

679
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Very good

680
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
As weird as that is

681
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
There's another commercial coming up that

682
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Even weirder

683
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
A lot

684
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:34,784
Call wants to tell you about a superpower that we do not know the globalist

685
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Alright

686
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Yeah

687
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
I mean

688
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,120
What kind of deal they can actually control

689
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,776
And stuff like that you know things that happened

690
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
Around volcanoes with a lot of these

691
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
You know

692
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:05,760
Poisonous gases infused fumigate from or whatever these volcanoes in a lot of wildlife starts dying off

693
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,600
Call line

694
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,976
So go both can control volcanoes

695
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
Understand

696
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
What exactly

697
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:26,240
I know I know a lot of wildlife around volcanoes

698
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
Houses that are really

699
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,312
But the globalists are causing

700
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
To be released

701
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,432
I don't understand what you don't understand

702
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,064
Also who is who's killing all the

703
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
Top of the Rock

704
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952
Because the dove is

705
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
And they cannot handle that I'm just

706
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,608
Eliezer

707
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Spitballing

708
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
Like maybe that's what they're doing

709
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,080
People can't even get any information about volcanoes.

710
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
I don't know probably

711
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,432
He still thinks the volcanoes are made of paper

712
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,344
The globalist just taught the Earth that's how they talk

713
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,672
You're dumb

714
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,744
Nobody's more of a snowflake

715
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,072
Always

716
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Everything

717
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Culture

718
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
Olive Garden

719
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
PCH least a pyroclastic

720
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,504
These commercials are f***** up but they're also on some level strategic

721
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,320
Navigate talks about the economy falling apart and

722
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,136
Commercials

723
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
On this episode

724
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
He talks a lot about how

725
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,000
The government is

726
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
For you because

727
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
There was a

728
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Somebody came out where

729
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
People were trying to push

730
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
4

731
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,680
Lowering the amount of fluoride.

732
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
Send the public drinking water

733
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
Alex

734
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
To be like

735
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
We now know it's bad

736
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
But the reality

737
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
Of any

738
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,480
So a little bit of fluoride is not really all that

739
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
From all the research I've done

740
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
But

741
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,576
Not

742
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
But

743
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
Doesn't matter how much it take

744
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,464
It's always good to know that

745
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,816
Always good for audio evidence

746
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
Good stuff

747
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,912
Take it all should not eat on hamburgers

748
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
We know that

749
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Bone broth

750
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Come on

751
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Like I said

752
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
Taste like chocolate according to Millie Weaver

753
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,248
Play one episode about fluoride

754
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,088

Do cyclists absolutely free

Fluoride

758

$50

759
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
There's the emergency

760
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,496
Crumbling

761
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
Fluoride in that

762
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,568
42nd commercial like four times

763
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
Make

764
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
But the reason that

765
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
There's a cowardliness on Alex

766
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,576
Who's part is that there is a plausible deniability argument

767
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,928
Yeah of course I advertised for this because

768
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
All of this stuff

769
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
The solution to

770
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
Which is not true

771
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,072
He wants to make the money

772
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
And his narrative

773
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
What products

774
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
Give him money

775
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,704
Filter fluoride

776
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
So I don't know why

777
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,640
A lot of those systems are charcoal

778
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:21,504
It's like the water runs through like charcoal beads or whatever in heavy metal

779
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Absorbed by the charcoal

780
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
I don't know I don't know it's fully and I don't

781
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,208
I don't know what big Berkey is up to but I will tell you I know

782
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,280
She's up to

783
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,864
Crushing small Berkey

784
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Starbucks

785
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Big Berkey

786
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,872
Alex still sells water filtration

787
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
But they're not big Berkey

788
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Like he has

789
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
The all of these products

790
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
A lot

791
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
That's not around anymore

792
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Vapor Galaxy

793
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
With the yelling

794
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
Let's make that

795
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,312
How can we make vaping more annoying

796
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
Salt Lake

797
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
Because I

798
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,736
That's that's not going to set the world on fire

799
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
I think that what

800
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
He does

801
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
Has done

802
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
2011

803
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
Is he has these products

804
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
Like the water filtration

805
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,512
And he's not making a good enough margin on it

806
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,584
Another company that's a little bit easier to exploit

807
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
A pushes harder

808
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
And get the better profit

809
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,960
With whatever

810
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
I think that's probably

811
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Or I guess

812
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
Get the name

813
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
Of course they

814
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,367
Her name is Big Bird the interview

815
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Various

816
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,743
But before we do we got one more commercial

817
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Advice

818
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Nuts

819
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
This is so crazy

820
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
I like it

821
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
But it's

822
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,727
Did this also made me Boardwalk

823
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,383
Diamond

824
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,983
Map turtle

825
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:15,583
Against

826
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,631
America today

827
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
Is awesome

828
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,751
But I should tell you that diamond gusset is a jean company

829
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
They self

830
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,103
I'm looking it up as we

831
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,919
We speak

832
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:36,319
Course you have open

833
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,367
Gossett

834
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
No

835
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:44,511
Arkansas

836
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
I love love songs

837
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,447
Here's a review from SP

838
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,519
I'm looking for a fact

839
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,567
A f

840
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,639
Not female Factory male Fear Factory

841
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
I like the

842
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,063
If you order online company is zero customer service

843
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,367
They're incapable of providing for Creek

844
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
Exercise

845
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,719
Manufacturing

846
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
All sizing Is Random

847
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,679
I have.

848
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:33,663
Their slogan is good luck lose weight

849
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:42,111
I've ordered multiple are the correct size

850
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,511
Mark 35-3-36

851
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
38 or 37

852
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,631
Seems to be random

853
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,935
They also refused to Hansel like pants

854
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
To get you the correct size

855
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,287
So basically this company is incapable of providing the correct

856
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
To the customer

857
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,711
I don't know but I also take

858
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
I love this place

859
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
There's another one from Eric

860
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,343
Not the guide

861
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
What about Rock Hill

862
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,559
Received

863
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:29,215
I love this place so much

864
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,735
It's my favorite thing they don't even provide return shipping now I get to pay $13 to return the pants they charge

865
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
I will never waste my money here again

866
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
You shouldn't either

867
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:52,767
Why would you give the pants to somebody else instead of waist 30

868
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
Dollars

869
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:02,495
Cortez customer service

870
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:07,359
Ordered three pairs of genes although really wanted a pair of their Defender G

871
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:14,015
They did not have my size in comprender so I ordered their Orange County Jean

872
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
But I made a request in the notes section that Arie

873
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
Really want the defender not the Orange County I have to take it make an adjustment

874
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,023
Received the jeans but never heard from them regarding my request

875
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,887
Then within 10 days they advertise

876
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,471
Well it so happened that all three pairs that I ordered were now on sale

877
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,567
I called them and asked if they would refund the difference between what

878
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
They said they cannot do that

879
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,943
I will return the order and get my money refunded for the whole order

880
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,503
Lost because of customer service

881
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
By the way

882
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
They refund the difference

883
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
This is one of the

884
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,607
They have grown like they have

885
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
God I love God

886
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,639
Everything

887
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
From Diamond gusset

888
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Serve.com from now on

889
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,623
Hard to believe

890
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:29,279
Keep in mind I have a cycle on my washing machine the customer service representative

891
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,583
Discernible

892
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
Informed me that they haven't never

893
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
That is

894
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:39,007
Forever meaning in the entire company history including the time this person probably didn't work there

895
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,871
After watching amazing this is possible

896
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:50,271
And the person is work there as long to know this

897
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,439
And they would look

898
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
At my expense

899
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,607
30-day guarantee on the website is a complete lie

900
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,679
Chicken look up

901
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,263
This is

902
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,359
Bisra Benjamin not Benjamin Button

903
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:21,759
I wouldn't recommend Diamond gusset they lost my order and kept me on the phone for 20 minutes to figure out what happen

904
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
Weather in American company

905
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
Batman's

906
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,671
They need to get organized

907
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
I love it

908
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
God

909
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,887
That's amazing.

910
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
Still in bed

911
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,959
Let's be on

912
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
If they move their Factory down south

913
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
Maybe they make a higher-quality product

914
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,407
Maybe they're suffering from American manufacturer

915
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,175
I don't know

916
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
But that song

917
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
Is a banger

918
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Alright

919
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
So here we go

920
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
I do want

921
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
CD and t-shirt

922
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Diamond gusset

923
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
America

924
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
So here we go we're getting into it

925
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Now

926
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,071
Everything is going to be

927
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,375
Insanity

928
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,727
History

929
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,055
No it's not random it's just

930
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Bizarre

931
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
In 2011

932
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
But

933
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
Every week

934
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
On Friday

935
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,599
Do you have a guy named Bob chapek

936
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Come on the show

937
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:36,255
Google search

938
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,839
Man killed in exactly

939
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,911
We figured it out

940
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:50,079
So he's apparently on every week and he is a Republican

941
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,127
Involved with Reagan

942
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
Gubernatorial

943
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,831
That he was involved in World News

944
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Insight

945
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
And what have you

946
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,719
We just had this interview with Charlotte

947
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
And about how

948
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
Reagan wanted to dumb down

949
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
Schools

950
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
Probably

951
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
The CMP

952
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
Is full of globalist

953
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,239
She wants to get out of no one

954
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,079
I think she said some bad things about Phyllis Schlafly

955
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Metallica

956
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Cannot stand for

957
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,151
A big slap Leafly

958
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Plant

959
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
Slightly flawed

960
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,015
What's a good dessert chapli fan

961
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:36,415
The first interview as a single

962
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
Instagram

963
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,215
They probably f****** fit when they

964
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
Alex is having this interview and

965
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Bob

966
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
The phone

967
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,223
He's been on hold for like 5 minutes

968
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
When are they go to him

969
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
Because the interview with Charlotte rampling

970
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,879
To get Bob

971
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
On the things

972
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,743
The cheese saying about Reagan

973
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
His

974
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,303
First-hand knowledge

975
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,631
Wild

976
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
I was involved

977
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
In the

978
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
A good material

979
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,055
Ronald Reagan was in

980
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,615
And I know a great deal about him

981
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
A lot of reasons

982
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,967
And I know a lot of things that

983
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
I'll never say on radio

984
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
Because it got me killed

985
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,463
Really looking for me

986
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,431
There's no way it's going to be

987
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Alex

988
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,015
Vet your guess

989
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
You know this is going to be a nightmare

990
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,367
You think you think it's

991
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,951
It might be

992
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
Conception of what is about to happen

993
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,143
Okay he's got some right

994
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,263
Stuff that he'll never say on the radio but he's about to say it on the radio

995
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,127
Cuz Alex

996
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Huge scoop

997
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Videos bullied his weekly guess

998
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
Into divulging

999
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,903
Get ready for it

1000
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
Because

1001
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
It is going to shock

1002
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Okay Mike down

1003
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
This is going to be shocking

1004
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,607
Reagan was a homosexual

1005
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:01,055
During the late 1930s and early 40s

1006
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
He was making

1007
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,895
What we would call today pro-communist peaches

1008
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
It all goes in

1009
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
It was part of the reason

1010
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,023
Dad he had as many roles as they had

1011
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:26,143
The movies because he really wasn't a very good actor you was doing sexual favors in Hollywood

1012
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
The Reagan wasn't

1013
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Actor Arya

1014
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,799
Are you kidding me how do you say

1015
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:39,199
He was the Bruce Campbell of his time so the reason I wanted to put the mic down wasn't because I was afraid of that be

1016
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Anything like that

1017
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,599
How long of a pause

1018
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,415
Alligator was at

1019
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Was gay

1020
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
Was gay

1021
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,303
Alex legitimately

1022
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,095
Probably thought

1023
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,167
To say that

1024
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
It literally

1025
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Be something like

1026
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
Really

1027
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
Came

1028
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
Juicy gossip

1029
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,247
Was you like

1030
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
What do I do

1031
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
I do

1032
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:27,583
Is there be two till they're on the other line

1033
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
So you might be asking

1034
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Turn yourself at this

1035
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
How's Bob

1036
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,495
What what information

1037
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Is he bringing to the

1038
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
That is not correct

1039
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,967
No I can't confirm or deny that but that's not what he's bringing to the Alex Jones Show

1040
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
Is what Bob has

1041
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,791
Information

1042
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,215
It just freaks me out the power of that knowledge

1043
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439
Styrofoam

1044
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
And I was also called

1045
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,583
By his girlfriend before he married Nancy

1046
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,191
Now this is making me sick

1047
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,335
A movie

1048
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,663
He's all film film of Reagan and banging a dude

1049
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:50,783
We're going to get two more specifics on that.

1050
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,879
I'm fine with what I'm fine with both or either

1051
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,695
The game hero

1052
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
We're going to get to all those details

1053
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Cuz Alex

1054
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:08,703
How to deal with it

1055
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,799
Because at this point cliff deal with it

1056
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
Beer

1057
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:19,711
This could get even you and me right now listening

1058
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,759
At this point

1059
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
In 2011 Alex Jones

1060
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,343
It's not a fully committed devout

1061
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,647
Bigot like his show is not

1062
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
At this point

1063
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,207
The Beyond

1064
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,999
The dog whistle hate speech

1065
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
I think

1066
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,143
But how we respond

1067
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,215
Is very different than he would now

1068
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:47,359
He would scream about all kinds of s*** and how it proves pedophile Etc

1069
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
But the fact that he's like

1070
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Warming

1071
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Rough

1072
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,807
Language that I don't like interview like if he was that way

1073
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
That's everything that's

1074
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Tacky

1075
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:04,767
Not necessarily horrible

1076
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,815
Kind of more reasonable man worth

1077
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
Stop at the same time

1078
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,703
Because he's not that outright screaming about different people

1079
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,775
Straight white Christians we're under attack

1080
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,847
Really know how

1081
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,871
To deal with

1082
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
He doesn't know where

1083
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:25,247
You should go with it and so he keeps asking Bob

1084
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Questions

1085
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:30,879
Illuminate

1086
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,671
Yes

1087
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,999
But we'll get to all the details

1088
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,791
That you might be curious about as this goes on

1089
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,119
I think we should leave a review on Alex Jones's website

1090
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
About how

1091
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
If you take all of his

1092
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Pills

1093
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,727
For a few years

1094
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
I don't think

1095
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,823
You're a smart person

1096
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,175
Because you think that there's a review section on Alex website

1097
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,455
Bear

1098
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
Look at Amazon

1099
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
So now then

1100
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,415
It is one that

1101
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
Hazel eyes that I know of

1102
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
Didn't do this

1103
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
And

1104
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
Another store

1105
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:18,495
Earlier on

1106
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,287
No

1107
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,823
Germany

1108
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:27,199
Quite frankly I was never in Berlin and it wouldn't let me go to Berlin

1109
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:34,111
No reason to do that

1110
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
At a private showing

1111
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:43,327
And most of the people here there I didn't even know

1112
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,655
By Invitation Only

1113
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:55,359
Was this a group

1114
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
And dumb

1115
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
Well that's all

1116
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,271
Deborah sorry but I learned before that

1117
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:08,159
Girlfriend

1118
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
That's right

1119
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,999
Still alive not

1120
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,303
He was probably be

1121
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,119
Are late 80s or 90s now

1122
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
So confused

1123
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
That

1124
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,983
Is my favorite thing

1125
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Also

1126
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Okay

1127
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,151
If I understand this correctly

1128
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,967
Goes to his mailbox one day

1129
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
Gets an RSVP

1130
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Absolutely

1131
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:39,135
Female vs male male

1132
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Eagles

1133
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
To this party

1134
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,071
Rockville

1135
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
Have sex with another man

1136
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,215
Let's not be too specific about what the film is cuz it.

1137
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,007
This point all we know is that the film

1138
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,567
How can firms

1139
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,967
And at the party

1140
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
Is a cross-section of

1141
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:12,159
These are the things that we know

1142
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:18,559
You know most of them

1143
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,399
Why would this be a party

1144
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,495
Beyonce

1145
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Theater

1146
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,359
Is there a home to properly watch

1147
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:36,479
Baguette really rich

1148
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,551
He refuses to say unequivocally

1149
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,367
This was an attempt to blackmail him

1150
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:46,207
And he says that it's not accurate to say that it's conservatives who were just

1151
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
Disgusted

1152
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
Bizarre

1153
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,447
Possible

1154
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
I watch that

1155
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,031
Yet so Alex

1156
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
Bang

1157
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
I did Point Alex

1158
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,615
Realizes that

1159
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,663
He's coming into some of the same issues

1160
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,735
In terms of like he's talking

1161
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
He's hearing a story be told

1162
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
He doesn't really know this

1163
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Specific

1164
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
What was the tape

1165
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,391
Lowriders

1166
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
Willard Willard

1167
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
Wilford Brimley

1168
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,351
Mustache

1169
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,191
Alex asked for more specific

1170
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:34,847
Dangerous

1171
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
No no

1172
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:50,463
Now

1173
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
The woman with him

1174
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,863
Who used an artificial device

1175
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
2

1176
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,215
Do what they did

1177
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,567
That's not gay

1178
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,919
I was trying to call covertly but not by a talent intelligence

1179
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:14,527
Agency

1180
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:25,791
Unbelievable

1181
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:30,655
Reagan like that place

1182
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
I love

1183
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,519
This Alex Jones

1184
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,199
This is weird

1185
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:48,063
Unexpected

1186
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,671
Awesome

1187
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Beverly

1188
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,975
Episodes back

1189
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Think about how

1190
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,351
One of the reasons that I feel so passionately about how much I hate

1191
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
The current Alex Jones

1192
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:06,495
Is because there is a place for this sort of thing

1193
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:10,591
You still full of s*** you still pushing narratives that are based on lies

1194
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
A

1195
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,431
It is

1196
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,575
What's the weirdest thing I heard there was Alex

1197
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,623
Given the very reasonable position of

1198
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:28,511
It's downright bordering on sex positive

1199
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,303
Strap-on

1200
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,399
Easily could have been like

1201
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:38,751
Kind of like

1202
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,567
West Coast Circle

1203
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,711
Possible

1204
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
It's funny and it's great

1205
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
I just hit this

1206
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,927
Bums me out just based on

1207
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,463
Who is Atman

1208
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
Watching Reagan

1209
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,119
We're not even close

1210
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
Done with the Bob

1211
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Does not make you gay

1212
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,959
No not at all

1213
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,799
So everybody like the last

1214
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
Coffee throwing out

1215
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
We are getting coffee thrown on him

1216
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,223
Get picking fights with strangers on the street

1217
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,783
Because they don't realize globalists

1218
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
What's that

1219
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,855
It's so depressing

1220
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
6 gears

1221
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,183
That huge of a

1222
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
Bummer

1223
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,351
It really is kind of the same

1224
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
Course at the Rattata

1225
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
For everybody

1226
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,775
Like Point how many of us

1227
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
Can actually talk to her parents

1228
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,871
Liberals

1229
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,943
My parents are strong liberals out there in Austin

1230
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,527
Families

1231
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,831
Conservative they've always been Republican

1232
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
Bright

1233
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
Christianity means

1234
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
What you do

1235
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,487
This level of

1236
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,535
Insanity from that

1237
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Weird

1238
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,423
It came on in degrees

1239
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,471
And especially with

1240
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,031
The youth I believe

1241
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
Including up to like 30 year old

1242
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,615
Rat

1243
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,943
Protecting my own age

1244
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,343
I think that a lot of it crept up on people through

1245
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Differing

1246
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,927
There was a lot of Subs

1247
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
Refuse like with gamergate stuff

1248
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,511
Men's rights activist

1249
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,791
Like those

1250
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
Communities

1251
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,351
Became portholes

1252
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
Two radical

1253
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Through

1254
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,727
Real rampant distrust

1255
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
Any liberal

1256
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
Movement in the liberal ideas

1257
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
The idea of a

1258
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,871
The George Soros is

1259
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,151
The trick everyone into

1260
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,175
Cultural Marxism

1261
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
Lego sorts of things

1262
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,271
Or implicitly apart of gamergate

1263
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,319
As much as

1264
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
They are so

1265
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
Based on

1266
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,647
Being anti-semite

1267
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,487
I am so I think for a lot of people don't think your parents

1268
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,303
Necessarily in that bill good but a lot of people

1269
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,839
Dvn

1270
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
Coming

1271
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,191
The end result that we have now is not what they

1272
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
Expected when they started that Pat

1273
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:22,847
They thought it maybe maybe semitism is a little bit out of line

1274
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,151
Maybe they are asking for too much

1275
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,967
Actually not want equality

1276
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
3

1277
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,599
I'm fragile male ego that kind of makes sense why someone would get

1278
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,903
Not realizing it

1279
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,463
Stop there you're going to end up

1280
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,767
Being an anti-semite

1281
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,095
But you know what it's a clear path

1282
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:49,471
He's a very to the idea that maybe Hitler was just a failed artist

1283
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Possible

1284
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
Like

1285
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,079
All it took was Gamers to be like

1286
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
I don't like

1287
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,151
Journalism ethics

1288
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
Tonight

1289
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:07,647
A gold star for one of his paintings and then we would be fine it's possible but I think the bigger issue

1290
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
It will be

1291
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:10,975
Park

1292
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,255
On looking back

1293
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,815
This. Of History

1294
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
Black mark

1295
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,887
History

1296
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,191
People especially men

1297
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Did not listen

1298
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,775
Into women in terms of gamergate

1299
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,103
Especially

1300
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,895
Stop the fact that people

1301
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
Turn such a blind eye

1302
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,527
Kind of hip to what was going on

1303
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,575
But I certainly didn't act out enough

1304
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,855
I didn't speak out

1305
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:41,439
But history will show

1306
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
When they write books

1307
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,303
And some people probably already have

1308
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,327
Write a maze

1309
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,911
You mean the guys who follow Trey Anastasio on tours

1310
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,031
I remember reading

1311
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,103
What the name of

1312
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,639
But

1313
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
The debate

1314
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Interviewing

1315
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
People after World War

1316
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
Who are always just

1317
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:13,183
It was a it was those guys over there I heard about those knots

1318
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
Seaspray we were always

1319
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,071
Like everyone is good

1320
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,631
Everyone else is terrible

1321
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:24,191
Go to one of those places

1322
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,239
And you will see so many

1323
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,543
Now who are losing their jobs and all that s***

1324
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
Know that they were

1325
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,511
We were f****** around

1326
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:52,095
It was a joke

1327
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,191
Narrative is already even

1328
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,751
Complete disaster

1329
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,151
The organization in the rally and

1330
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,967
In Boston is going on as we record this

1331
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,503
Today

1332
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,319
Optimism

1333
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
Trulia beautiful

1334
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:21,791
Do wrong later tonight

1335
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
You know

1336
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:26,143
They still haven't released the guys who beat the s*** they still haven't

1337
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
The s*** out of Dion

1338
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,543
They are

1339
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
And they have address

1340
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,735
Who's Patricia

1341
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
Who's the snowflake the hundred

1342
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,551
The people who went

1343
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,575
To the police station

1344
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
To say hey

1345
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,391
We took down

1346
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,183
F******

1347
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Bulshit

1348
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,791
Confederate statue

1349
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
Somebody in his

1350
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
To do anything

1351
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,287
F*** the whole whole narrative that the Liberals snowflakes are all that

1352
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
No

1353
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
No

1354
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
Yeah yeah yeah

1355
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,039
It's not hypersensitivity

1356
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:21,439
Something is morally repugnant

1357
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,999
You know there's a lot of

1358
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:26,047
Unpack

1359
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071
In terms of

1360
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
There's a lot of foreign

1361
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:29,887
Issues

1362
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Equally repulse

1363
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,239
Something we should

1364
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
Maybe take a look at wheel do a good enough

1365
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,567
Job

1366
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Uno

1367
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:44,479
Around the world

1368
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:52,671
We focus on Alex and unfortunately that means

1369
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,743
Can't talk about how terrible other governments are

1370
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,535
Outside of let's arz

1371
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
And Russia

1372
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
Turkey

1373
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
F****** turkey

1374
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,655
He-Man

1375
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,239
Isn't which one was was

1376
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,519
Who was it that was

1377
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,287
Plymouth

1378
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,847
Flynn was the one who's working for tomorrow

1379
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,663
Yeah cuz I was more based out of Ukraine

1380
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
Can you say that's it

1381
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,303
Alex wants

1382
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,351
To know when Bob saw the film

1383
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,407
Here was this whenever you were shown this film

1384
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,855
Late 1970s

1385
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,927
Early 1980s

1386
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,207
That doesn't Inspire comp

1387
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,999
What if it was a late night

1388
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,535
Seventies an early night

1389
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,303
1880s

1390
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,583
Reagan was

1391
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,631
Either president or just about to

1392
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Yeah

1393
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
So

1394
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,567
Get around around the store

1395
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,639
Somebody invited Bob Chapman

1396
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,735
Of the president

1397
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,503
Yes

1398
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,599
I would say

1399
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,159
Think of all the positive feelings

1400
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
Oh I was invited to this

1401
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
So cool

1402
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
Happy to watch the

1403
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
The president getting

1404
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,423
Alright

1405
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:43,007
I don't even think they gave him a reach-around

1406
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:46,335
You know what I'm saying

1407
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
But like

1408
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,735
Do you eat the nail kind of on the head I think

1409
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,783
With your first piece there that is

1410
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,831
Given the timeframe

1411
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,623
Sibley important figure

1412
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
So-vi

1413
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,511
Involved

1414
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Is like

1415
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,863
Only have a decade

1416
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,447
Late 70s early 80s

1417
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,751
10 years

1418
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,287
You would remember

1419
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,823
Very clearly

1420
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:24,223
That would definitely that would be my 911 that's for sure

1421
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,295
Question the entire credibility of the story

1422
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:30,623
If it was me

1423
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,391
And let's say

1424
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
I get invited to parties

1425
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,463
I see Trump getting paid

1426
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,863
I remember there was

1427
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,679
Two clouds in the sky one bird flu B like he would have

1428
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,239
Total Recall

1429
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:49,055
I would still remember exactly

1430
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,223
Because he's afraid

1431
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,759
Spell whatever

1432
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
I bet Trump

1433
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
Olivia's

1434
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,279
Who cares

1435
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
This next clip

1436
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,119
Are we getting two more about the nature of the screening

1437
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,935
Again

1438
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,895
Screaming

1439
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
Who is Ali

1440
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,551
I know already

1441
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:39,231
How did you know

1442
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
No way no way

1443
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,047
Settlements important

1444
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,839
They got me there and

1445
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,727
I really didn't know what the content was going to be

1446
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:30,943
I don't think so

1447
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Yes

1448
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,039
How old

1449
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:43,231
Quite frankly can't remember

1450
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,303
That's a good question

1451
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
I would say older

1452
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,503
Hahaha

1453
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:10,879
Is there anything else Bob you can hear the frustration

1454
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
Thought

1455
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,719
We're standing on the precipice

1456
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
I don't know

1457
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:25,215
I don't know what it would be some sort of drug running operation inside information

1458
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:28,287
Stop baby

1459
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:31,103
Well I mean

1460
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,895
Involved

1461
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,455
Dealing with Nicaragua

1462
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,527
Alex

1463
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,807
Really like I said

1464
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,855
This whole time you just does not know what to do

1465
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,903
He's really struggling

1466
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
To figure out what to judge

1467
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,743
Do you have nowhere to put his

1468
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,047
Disgust really

1469
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,607
Angry public bigot

1470
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
Breton can't just be like

1471
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
Clear

1472
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,471
This guy is a queer

1473
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,495
Have to figure out like

1474
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,311
What is it about this story that I'm mad about

1475
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,831
Yes

1476
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:19,487
But here we go

1477
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,679
As like this

1478
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:46,111
Republican

1479
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,951
When I was six years old

1480
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,095
But it's not even doing something

1481
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,119
Freaky

1482
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,215
It's

1483
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,639
Trinkets

1484
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:12,223
I know you know all these people

1485
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,319
You were friends with

1486
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,719
How to compute that

1487
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,023
Hollywood ask

1488
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,351
Film

1489
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,543
Why were you invited to this meeting

1490
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,383
Because I was going to do a couple of other people who are invited

1491
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,807
No they just said his

1492
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,599
A very interesting film

1493
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,927
And that you should come and watch it and

1494
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,511
I know these people.

1495
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,815
And that's what I found out

1496
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,911
And they sent to me afterwards well what do you think I said well

1497
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,447
I'm surprised that I'm not

1498
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:09,055
And then I told him what I had learned from somebody else he is before

1499
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,847
And

1500
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,111
No these four people

1501
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:25,951
The ones who I knew who was there who I knew who they were

1502
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,255
Very conservative people

1503
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,839
But there are other people there I didn't know so

1504
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,959
1518

1505
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:49,247
Around 4:11

1506
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,783
And

1507
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
And

1508
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
I like him

1509
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,135
I am is a very nice person

1510
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,671
Apparently

1511
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,207
Timmy socialite

1512
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,607
That's just the way it turned out and you know

1513
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:07,167
Another southern California for 36 years

1514
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,848
He would find out things like that about people

1515
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,920
Normally find

1516
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,480
I want in Indianapolis Indiana

1517
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:25,856
It was a pretty wild lifestyle in California and New York City

1518
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,440
Lot of pagan automatically Southern California well I guess

1519
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:36,096
San Francisco Hillsdale

1520
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
Beautiful

1521
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,984
Los Angeles

1522
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,360
Willie

1523
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,600
That seems to be where he's Landing

1524
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,368
It's bad

1525
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,392
The film sex

1526
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:03,232
So he doesn't know what to do here

1527
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,096
Weird Hollywood lifestyle

1528
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,960
I don't approve of it I'm not condemning it I don't know what a guy and a girl dude spot.

1529
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,520
I love

1530
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,056
Summary of like

1531
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,848
I didn't know it was going to be

1532
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,128
My friend said is a very

1533
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,992
So we thought and afterwards they asked me what did I do

1534
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,832
I thought there was some third act she was like what are you

1535
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,976
Right what do you think

1536
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:41,376
Just my opinion but I did not know that

1537
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:51,872
Already has the girlfriend for the pastor's told him this already

1538
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,152
My girlfriend

1539
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,944
Did the girlfriend didn't tell him

1540
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:01,856
That he was gay the girlfriend said he likes getting picked on evolve time there was no

1541
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,904
Differentiation

1542
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,184
He probably heard from

1543
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,208
From the girlfriend that he likes

1544
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:10,560
Maybe a finger in the ass

1545
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
Opposed

1546
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,632
You just like

1547
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,704
Let's get weird

1548
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,544
Should have tried it immediately

1549
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Tonight right

1550
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:26,688
Yeah

1551
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:33,088
Grow up Bob

1552
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,112
Your a****** that turns you

1553
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,416
I don't know but fine

1554
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,560
Alex is not

1555
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
Sure what to do

1556
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,144
He's judging California but them being like

1557
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,472
The Willy like I don't like

1558
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
88

1559
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,592
Let

1560
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,896
Amateur

1561
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,712
At this point it does not know what he's

1562
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,760
Ian is next clip

1563
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
He sort of makes clear that

1564
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
In his defense

1565
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:08,416
That's a weird ass pic to be told

1566
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
So weird

1567
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,072
Now that's a weird

1568
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:20,448
Huge scoop

1569
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
Conspiracy

1570
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,312
Communist could be Bohemian Grove

1571
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
I did instead

1572
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,944
Regularly had on the show just dropped in with life

1573
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,992
Reagan gay

1574
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,272
Golden

1575
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:40,416
Just drop that I shouldn't be talking about this it'll get us killed or whatever

1576
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,464
Even if

1577
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,024
Walter Cronkite you're not going to be like

1578
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,096
Well I've got a plan for this one

1579
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
I think

1580
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,448
And Alex's shoes I could kind of roll with it

1581
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,848
Serious that's true best

1582
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,128
Can to ask questions

1583
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,664
Isaac

1584
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,200
Revealing that Bob

1585
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,504
Does not have a good grasp on.

1586
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
Details

1587
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,112
Barring any other

1588
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:15,488
Any invitation to a party that I might get in the future but like

1589
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,792
Without employees

1590
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,840
I don't believe him

1591
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,144
These details don't make sense

1592
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,192
The vagueness of

1593
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
His inability to answer

1594
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,312
Pictures that are very simple

1595
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,592
When did you see this

1596
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,640
Bratz why were you there

1597
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
It's all just

1598
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,480
So vague now I imagine this tape

1599
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
As being like the room

1600
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:46,720
Play Rocky Horror

1601
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,256
Touche

1602
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,048
Alex

1603
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,608
It kind of shows a little bit of his cards

1604
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,656
The real

1605
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:58,240
But he is pretty bummed out

1606
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:02,080
She said Bob that one time that's

1607
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:08,480
Way to go Bob

1608
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,392
I don't know I think it was for blackmail

1609
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,928
And

1610
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,048
I think use politically later

1611
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,168
Rainbow Rocks

1612
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,944
I really don't know there

1613
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,528
It was fine

1614
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:21,952
Republican

1615
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:29,888
Workaround

1616
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,872
A superhighway

1617
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:46,784
I don't think so but I do believe have to have a

1618
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:52,672
Yeah at this point H is not development

1619
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,488
2011 that was not a piece

1620
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
Please go to worldview

1621
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,328
It's possible that he just doesn't think

1622
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,960
He's not as frenetic a broadcaster at this point

1623
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,264
But the new information that he has about Reagan

1624
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:15,968
You Don't Have You released

1625
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,040
Iowa

1626
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,856
I don't care places 202 me

1627
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:28,512
I'm more interested

1628
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,608
There were these parties

1629
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,376
The people watching

1630
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,448
Know that to me is much more

1631
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,984
Where do you get

1632
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,080
I don't know I think it's probably has come and gone

1633
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,616
Anymore

1634
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,944
We got screwed

1635
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,016
Gcn

1636
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:55,392
Sounds good career

1637
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,696
Play engage enough kind of thing

1638
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:07,424
I was very very prevalent in I live there in the 67

1639
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,984
How long long time

1640
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,520
End of the 90s

1641
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:15,616
And so I ain't I saw Lots I lived in Malibu for years

1642
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,664
A lot of time

1643
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,944

01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,760
Play all of Los Angeles pets

1645

01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,088
Lots of people

1647
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,440
Nothing surprises me

1648
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,216
I don't see how she could not

1649
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,008
I have known

1650
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:50,944
It's much easier

1651
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,488
The other evidence I had

1652
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:10,656
Something I've talked about in all the years

1653
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,600
My personal experience

1654
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:38,304
Beatbox

1655
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:44,192
I thought you were

1656
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
He was on the edge

1657
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,800
Oh man

1658
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:49,824
That is in

1659
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,104
Same disappoint

1660
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,736
Also I love you

1661
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
I love

1662
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
Turn of that

1663
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,624
Clip

1664
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,160
Alex

1665
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,208
They can use animation with black and white

1666
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
Clips

1667
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,256
Maybe it's

1668
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:12,352
Bob's response

1669
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:14,912
So that

1670
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:19,008
I don't matter

1671
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,592
I don't have any other

1672
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:32,064
So that's the end of a Alex interviewing Bob

1673
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
About this

1674
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:37,952
But there's a Cota after he's done still on the phone

1675
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,488
It gets really boring

1676
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,352
There's no more risk

1677
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,632
Is it go up from reggae

1678
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,656
You gay

1679
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,152
God

1680
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,968
So they go to commercial

1681
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,248
And then they come back

1682
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:08,928
Browning mobile.

Everybody takes the field trip

Winona weather

1692
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,184
I should have said anything that

1693
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,744
It sounds like that's just the way it is

1694
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,096
Fake laugh

1695
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,144
Send a famous a nice guy

1696
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,680
But

01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:00,288
Everybody has their while many people have pugs Liberties that

1698
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
Different than others

1699
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,360
But

1700
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:08,224
It was quite an experience living for 36 years in Southern California

1701
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,416
Moving on

1702
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:25,120

01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,096
As I recalled good I believe

1713
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,912
DaVita cases prison planet was the original website

I don't know I don't care about him at all

1721
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
But

1722
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,880
It's going to be a great time travel question

1723
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,696
What's up if you could go back in time and murder

1724
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,464
Watson would you

1725
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:27,328
It'll be the same conversation about Hillary

1726
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,864
He's not going to commit

1727
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,032
Make him feel less scared of everything

1728
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,056
LOL

1729
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,384
Seems to motivate Paul Joseph Watson Twitter

1730
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,152
Extreme degree

1731
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:42,944
Spear of every

1732
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:48,576
Resume Ronald Reagan and secretive organization

1733
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,344
Screening

1734
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,160
They don't want people that's what they're going

1735
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,144
Let me be clear

1736
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,960
I'm going to see Reagan get paid you want to come on with

1737
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,336
I asked you would want to crash

1738
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,152
Let me

1739
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:13,920
Perfectly

1740
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,320
Cordially invite you to

1741
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:22,624
A screening of a video of

1742
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,904
LBJ

1743
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,928
Getting up eggs

1744
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,488
There will be hot dogs

1745
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,096
There'll be food and drink

1746
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:37,216
I really want a chili dog right about now where I'm at

1747
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:42,336
If they said you know food and drink will be taken care of

1748
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:48,224
The private sector will be much more likely to go

1749
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,016
Interesting film

1750
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:54,624
You should see him down 7 days a week

1751
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,792
What you doing go see baby driver

1752
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,328
Do you want to go see it no

1753
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:06,912
But I'm not

1754
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936

1756
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:14,080
I can't see your film of LBJ getting pegged later

1757
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:22,272
I'd like to say

1758
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:28,928
I knew that this was something that had happened

1759
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,720
But I did not know the date

1760
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
Being pinpointed

1761
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:34,816

If you'd like to send us back to a particular date

1768
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,640
You can do so by going to

1769
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,176
