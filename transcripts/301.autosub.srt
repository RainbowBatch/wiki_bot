00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
About Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
What was the last time you had

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,712
Cigarette

5
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,184
Maybe like a month ago or so

6
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,768
But otherwise

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,816
It wasn't

8
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,424
Successfully transitioned over to a vape

9
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
The ideas of like

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
Cigarette will be so much better if they're really not

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
So

12
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
Just an Illusion of a bygone past

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
It is

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
2 months since I

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
The regular

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
I just don't miss

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,904
It's weird how about you

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
I feel like

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Cigarette but I don't really

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Hashtag

21
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Vapelife apparently

22
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:16,800
Cigarettes

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
People who signed up

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552

29
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376

Thank you

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
Very much

35
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,184
So taxable income you are now it's

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Democrat

37
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
Heroin

38
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Is freakishly large

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
Thank you so much thank you very much

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
Hey I like this show.

41
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Show

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Jordans

43
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,816
Episode

44
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
It's rough

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
Because what I'm going to do is I'm going to

46
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Play you a clip

47
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
When this is from

48
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,200
Appeal to you what's a timeframe we're talking about

49
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Context clues

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
To figure out what era Alex Jones

51
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
This episode is from

52
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,976
So are we are we doing this is something Alex

53
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Could be saying 10 years ago or is it just out of the blue

54
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
That's not fair

55
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
Chucky

56
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Boxers

57
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Fourth Amendment

58
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096
Because they're criminals

59
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Society

60
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
Proposition

61
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,712
So you got you got the globalist

62
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,064
Me to take power and their opponents

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
Which is very in line with the ideas of the present day

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Qanon

65
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
Right I don't know what do you think

66
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
What is Kenly

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Archetype

68
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Globalist

69
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
2011 or 2013

70
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,711
24 through 28

71
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,319
2013

72
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
221

73
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,535
The reason that I didn't go at all I hoped it would

74
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
But the reason I did

75
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Was

76
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Contacts

77
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
What you saying

78
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
Is almost identical

79
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
He's expressing at the Press

80
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
The Narrative never changes

81
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,639
The idea that the globalists are going to go to jail unless they do something

82
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Is always there

83
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,247
It's consistently there

84
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
BECU in the present

85
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Although I thought for sure you'd be able to tell

86
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Glycol

87
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
I guess you didn't say in 2011

88
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
2013

89
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
You could tell it wasn't present vocal patterns are

90
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
So f****** different

91
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
Just imagine

92
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
The present is Ludacris

93
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
No no that's not

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
Play reference

95
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Just the way he

96
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Organizing his

97
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
The way he's speaking

98
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
The mannerisms the delivery

99
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
The East luring

100
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Or apps

101
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,599
Since their of obviously

102
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,231
I thought it might be a time travel episode anywhere like going to be like

103
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
I don't want the next request

104
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Where you're coming

105
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
Over the 24th to the 28th

106
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Wide span of time

107
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Because

108
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Some of it was a

109
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Slog

110
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Need to find things to talk about

111
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
You can listen to whole episodes

112
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Doughboy

113
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:28,863
He's almost a college for people

114
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
I don't

115
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Let me be let me be clear about this

116
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Contacts

117
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
It doesn't help that quick

118
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Don't know what

119
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
He was trying to express there because he doesn't truth

120
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,183
From where I'm sitting right

121
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Yeah

122
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
It's not accredited

123
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
So in this first clip we're going to start here on January

124
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
24th and Alex

125
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
The racist

126
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
1721

127
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Because

128
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
British are the best of that they took over the world

129
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Kind of

130
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,007
Little Elementary that that is like

131
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,895
Fun fun way to look back on our history

132
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
To talk about

133
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
. big

134
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,295
Is anytime at your herb maybe he should talk about it tells us about what he thinks

135
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
History was

136
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
It is a Fantastical ridiculous

137
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Ridiculous

138
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Doubt

139
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
K member

140
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Context of Alex

141
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
Beginning this episode without describe is

142
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
The protracted rant about

143
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
His friends

144
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Because they won't turn in their guns

145
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
He has this conception that's like I don't want to turn in my guns oh well you're a racist then

146
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
More about American history we're all Native American tribes basically have the same run

147
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
Fighting each other exactly

148
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,439
I don't believe anyone is actually making a

149
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Accusation that Alex

150
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
To the races because he won't

151
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
Misunderstood

152
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
What they're saying

153
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,943
Just listen to really be a full demonstration

154
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Alex

155
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
A huge monster astray

156
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Discusses Native American tribes

157
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,999
How bigotry inform his worldview

158
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
The contacts that I clip is that

159
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
You say that the globalist

160
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
They're trying to trick us

161
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Listen to fighting with each other

162
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Heathside loves

163
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
Attracted to take him and his friends a racist

164
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Does the globalist want to demonize them

165
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,407
The globalist of trying to play Alex and dollastic

166
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Each other quote like

167
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Native America

168
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,063
The first problem that jumps out of the Alex is trying to present the plight of the Native America

169
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,903
The drives in early American history is being the result of them being gullible and stupid

170
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
There's so many more of them than the whites

171
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,071
The fighting with each other

172
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,655
Or they were nice

173
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
The second problem where is real bigotry is on Full display

174
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,015
Yeah that's a problem problem

175
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
Because he gets most of his information about Native American

176
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
From F Troop

177
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
Christopher Columbus arrived

178
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
Easy call the people he encountered in

179
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,559
Urban Viola curator the Smithsonian

180
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Intuition

181
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
National Museum of Natural History

182
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
A fundamental mistake that persists to this day.

183
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
To speak about quotes

184
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
The America

185
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Can Indian

186
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
Despite their small numbers the Indian peoples of North America

187
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
In terms of languages clothes

188
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
Lifestyles militant

189
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Religion

190
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,903
Different parts of North America have differed greatly from each other

191
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Native American tribes

192
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Look similar

193
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,375
Into him and knocked out

194
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,007
It's for someone to say that in the late 1700s a real site

195
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
Elsevier bigotry in the Bible

196

It's

France-info

201
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,135
The distance error like the size of

00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
Indiana and Illinois

203
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975

Dismissal

208
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
But you're smart enough to develop individualistic

209

210
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Which is classic

211
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Classic

212
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Which come together

213
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Like peanut butter and jelly

214
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Oh yeah

215
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
And how great

216
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
Show and how it's been awesome

217
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
Getting real tired of him bragging about the

218
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
It's kind of like that, you know who gets a big gig and talks about it for five years

219
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
I'm getting with Alex

220
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Insulting

221
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
Piers Morgan talking about how stupid

222
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
Idiot

223
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Experiencing

224
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
The JFL audition process

225
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Such bull

226
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Since I got in the new faces

227
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
5 years ago

228
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
I just you know they won't allow me to do it I had a great time and I loved while we're on the subject

229
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Alex talks about Piers Morgan

230
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
And how was the bigger

231
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Was aired on

232
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,911
Thoughts

233
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,335
Different department

234
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,967
Neon

235
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,351
I would imagine that someone being polite trying to end the conversation

236
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
Places don't want to have

237
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,519
Alex on not because they don't want the ratings or they're afraid of him it's a

238
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,359
Pop you know it's it's it's a cheap way to get

239
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Attention

240
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
The quality of what you're doing in the concept

241
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
What is like

242
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Start booking

243
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
Yeah yeah

244
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,983
Play Alex's mind work

245
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Which

246
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
With how much

247
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
Baby

248
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,687
A Morgan show was i j k

249
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Quotes

250
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Even his own telling of here

251
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
He didn't accomplish anything

252
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Piers Morgan is still an a******

253
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,487
His precious guns are still in Peril of being grabbed by Dianne Feinstein discourse hasn't been

254
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
The way I was raised in this

255
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
Is correct

256
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
That was a media event

257
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
Netgear Donley at generating

258
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Publicity

259
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
A PR stunt

260
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
That's all that was

261
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
And he knows it

262
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,127
I decided back on 2012 in January 2013

263
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
See if Alex is playing stood up to scrutiny

264
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
The Disappearance of a Morgan.

265
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Cable ratings

266
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
All of the networks

267
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
The decided

268
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
I'm going to

269
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Consider all media coverage

270
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
To be relevant to my calculator

271
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
So I'm not just

272
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Considering overtly

273
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Manufacturer

274
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
Manufactured although there may be some

275
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,311
Here's some of the things that happened in 2012 that people certainly remember way more than Alex yelling at Piers Morgan

276
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle Summer Olympic Games in London for remembering

277
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,319
President minister

278
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
Murder of Trayvon Martin

279
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
The Curiosity Rover landed on Mars

280
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,071
Barack Obama

281
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,911
Gardner live stream jumping out of space

282
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
From that Red Bull balloon become a man to break

283
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
The sound barrier without a vehicle

284
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,127
The s*** out of that Madison Bumgarner won the World Series 2012

285
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
It was even your magic baby

286
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,343
Grumpy Cat

287
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
And of course we saw that your saw the deaths of

288
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:32,255
Houston Andrew Breitbart

289
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,839
Rodney King Ernest Borgnine Neil Armstrong and Michael Clarke

290
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
Aurora and Sandy Hook shooting

291
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,519
What do you do it I'm not I don't

292
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Did Judge at all

293
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
Borgnine movie list

294
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
He's a big Superstar

295
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
They're probably other choices I could have made a list of celebrity deaths but

296
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:03,487
Relevant

297
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Probably

298
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Is the biggest f****** thing

299
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
There was an election

300
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,215
Yeah yeah it's whatever

301
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
Did narcissistic a******

302
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Thinking it like we are the

303
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,759
I yelled at Piers Morgan and it changed the world

304
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
This is mad

305
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Because

306
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Feinstein

307
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
May or may not have meant

308
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
Been talking about gun

309
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Control bill

310
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Alex

311
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
And he said something

312
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
Tragic

313
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
Considering what we know

314
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
From where his career

315
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
A Muslim

316
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,303
Muhammad

317
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,375
Yes I can imagine that would happen

318
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
Stretch

319
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:38,719
Condescending impression that he did at the end

320
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Literally

321
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,631
So much of his now he's screaming about how atheist secretly worship the devil

322
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:51,775
So what your bosses

323
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:58,175
Totally

324
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
Steven B

325
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
Even if she is a Christian you don't speak for me lady Christians all the times before everybody

326
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:12,255
Lorax guy

327
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,863
The middle of that clip which is the real tragic

328
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
It's funny to look back at this and maybe like wouldn't that be just

329
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
So awful of me

330
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Not much

331
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,783
Like technically why he's kicked off all these social media platforms

332
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,855
But he could he could probably imagine that that

333
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
That's the

334
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Even try that

335
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Ultimate

336
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Nothing

337
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
You have no consequences Alex

338
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,679
Except for if you add jatate long enough you'll go on Joe Rogan again

339
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Throw us overboard

340
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
The Jordan

341
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Piers Morgan

342
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,247
Wouldn't that be great

343
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
That would be a bold move

344
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,415
Gcn sponsor Piers Morgan

345
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,791
It's not that but this

346
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
Screaming commercial

347
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,567
Conspiracy

348
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
To discover exactly what it is

349
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,696
I'm not sure how long this video be online but go to weird device.com before it's gone forever

350
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Again

351
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
That's weird device.com

352
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
Weird device.com

353
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:29,472
Hi level sponsorship coming in from weird device.com

354
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
God I want

355
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,336
Gevalia to redo that audio because that is

356
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,992
What are your first thoughts about your device

357
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,320
Well commercial

358
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,720
It's the first thing I thought is a banner ad like try this one weird trick to make your device

359
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
Or whatever it is

360
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,328
Like that kind of thing and then 280 million is really

361
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
It is a lot

362
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
What 8% of the population

363
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
80

364
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
8

365
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,432
It's 8% population

366
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:16,064
YouTube 280 million

367
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,928
Discounted whatever he was saying

368
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,232
Start

369
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,048
No longer function

370
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,984
So we may never know exactly what the weird device

371
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
The video down

372
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:42,176
I don't know it's not

373
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,992
I think it might have been something about you

374
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
He fears

375
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
Cuz I think it's probably some sort of a

376
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
Threat to the power grid

377
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Sure

378
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,256
That makes the most if it's 280

379
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
Would be affected by knocking out of the power grid by nef

380
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
Maybe that's the rest of the

381
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Broadcast

382
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,800
Another possibility is that I found another product at this dump

383
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,360
Pretty cells that is referred to as a weird device

384
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,176
But I don't think it's the same one because it's

385
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Just a solar-powered kennel

386
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
It's very weird

387
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,368
Advertising it online

388
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
It's very strange

389
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,280
I don't know it looks like it was made for TV products

390
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
Oh here's to make a giant donut

391
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
The sun's rays

392
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Take a tall cylinder

393
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
That's basically how I sell it

394
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
You know what else is a solar cattle

395
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
A really hot day

396
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,904
I don't think that's the commercials for

397
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
Open this late 2012 early 2013 time. I've been hearing that commercial for the weird device and every time

398
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
Suppress the urge to

399
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Figure out what it is

400
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,544
Is I know from listening to Alex

401
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
They have this great thing that you

402
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
Come on come on look at it

403
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,880
It's always been satisfied

404
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,488
Marketing Traditions are really manipulative and emergencies in secrecy

405
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Like that commercial

406
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
Decided I wouldn't even

407
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
So I can get into it trying to figure out what Frank

408
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,168
Mike Bates in a weird device are all about

409
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
But this time

410
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Couldn't stop

411
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,264
I had to get to the bottom of this

412
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,128
And thankfully it wasn't too hard

413
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Progress

414
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
The weird device

415
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,368
Is the advertising campaign put out by a company called for paper

416
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
The company that sell survival Foods

417
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,512
And all sorts of other statutes suspect Patriot Orient

418
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
It's a company

419
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
Stop Frank Bates has the face of

420
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
The company it is story is this

421
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Downtrodden

422
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Patriot Ledger

423
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,032
His family it's a dude is unfair termination by an evil business

424
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Power cost

425
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
The driven him out of his home

426
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
The federal government wanted to put him in a FEMA camp

427
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
As Beauchamp

428
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Bates testimony

429
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Dependence

430
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Three meat product

431
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
Is the Beating Heart of the 4patriots

432
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Brand public m

433
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,976
Prevacid

434
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
These products that they sell are the things that allowed Frank Bates to break

435
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Free of government oppression

436
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
High power cost

437
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
Then all the rest of the other b*******

438
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
Become a independent

439
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Patriot

440
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Yeah I'm starting to

441
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Suspecting some issues

442
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Well the first issue

443
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896
There's literally no evidence the Frank

444
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:08,256
4patriots is a company that was started by a guy named Allen Baylor a Harvard graduate

445
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
Affiliate marketing

446
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,144
This is the sort of thing where person is aiming to drive to

447
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
Take to a seller's website

448
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
So they create their own website

449
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,312
As a resource on product

450
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
With links to the sellers website

451
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,456
The internet is littered with websites like this where page is like a write-up of the importance of

452
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Humidifying air

453
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,528
They have a bunch of essays with

454
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
Talk at the right words keywords in it

455
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Amazon link

456
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
I choose specific

457
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
Humidifier that is what

458
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,816
The goal is to get the website

459
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,400
SEO

460
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
Then the affiliate marketer get the card of all the purchases

461
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Does it come from

462
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Pics of that link

463
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,056
Around 2011 Balor

464
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Be conservative

465
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Community r-vi began Focus

466
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Specific

467
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
He began a company called reboot marketing

468
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
The parent company of all the various

469
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Initiative

470
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
And by all accounts

471
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
He created

472
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
To appeal to all the little things

473
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
To conservatives

474
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
Which all basically boils down to

475
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Frank paranoia

476
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
In 2012

477
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
The company brought in

478
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
11.8

479
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Million dollars

480
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
To quote Beauchamp

481
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:29,152
All Ballard does is drink someone else's stuff and paranoid anti-obama finery

482
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
And advertise it

483
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,016
Fictional life story

484
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,416
His his advertising

485
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Brilliant

486
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,584
Earlier

487
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,984
He's not he's not creating any

488
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
Into the world

489
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,640
He's just manipulating you just recognize his and sending them to Amazon

490
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,968
He's just recognized how easy it is

491
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
2conv

492
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,576
At least this

493
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Descend

494
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Descended

495
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Hey man

496
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Advertising

497
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
TheBlaze

498
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
It was pretty endemic

499
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Now I would like this

500
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
It's such an interesting

501
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,568
Justin question 2 of like the legality

502
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,640
You just make it up this guy as the picture

503
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,760
Defrauding people

504
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,832
Horrible that this guy is real

505
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
But where it does get into like a

506
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
AC laws

507
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Being violated

508
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Is

509
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
If Frank Bates

510
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
They faked character is giving a

511
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Testimonial

512
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
That these products

513
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,680
All right you are entering the territory of

514
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
Defraud right

515
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
This weird I don't know if he's ever broken the law

516
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
Navigation

517
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Is that

518
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
Weird Middle Ground

519
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,600
Are you still like you're stealing money from anybody.

520
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
He is because I think a lot of them have

521
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Sirius Marco

522
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Oh yeah I understand from that article

523
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Progress there is some

524
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
Like buying a ton of stuff from

525
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
And then

526
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Seriously Mark

527
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
Get up

Is 1

530
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
Fireplace started

531
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
But it appears that the business may have grown to

532
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:45,088
He's also starting to sell his own self of other companies

533
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,048
Supply.com

534
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,632
Jesus Christ according to that thinkprogress article Yeti

535
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
Severe markup survival

536
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264
Yeah

537
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,896
Is doing

538
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
It's weird an advert

539
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Retirement

540
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:22,720
Basically for Alex's business model on his show

541
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,256
Deborah's almost like Alex

542
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
She's missing out on

543
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
If it's adolescent

544
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
You has very

545
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
If you

546
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
Outside hustles

547
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
Other than his own business

548
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
Right what other kind

549
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Like whatever

550
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Possibly

551
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Secret funding

552
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
Just the advertiser.

553
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Limerick soap guy

554
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,464
Is water filtration device

555
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
Is actually limericks out

556
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,096
It's entirely possible device

557
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,120
And

558
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Before Patriots

559
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
Is

560
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Specifically

561
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
Veto power of what sponsors they put on his show

562
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
So it's not like

563
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:23,392
Hey Alex we're going to put this ad on your show against your will

564
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
Either it's just either accepts it

565
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
Courted the sponsorship or

566
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
He doesn't care

567
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
Doesn't have I would go with has no idea

568
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
Based on

569
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,264
You know there's no way that Alex

570
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,616
Marketing

571
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:49,248
He would get very bored easily

572
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
And I've heard other one

573
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
Frank Bates before

574
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
Like I've heard him do others

575
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Address

576
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
In other time.

577
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
For a while

578
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
It's like having bugs

579
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
So good

580
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
I love that he made it up that's

581
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
So funny

582
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
Where where does the

583
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
You got to respect

584
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,152
Where is the

585
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
Care about these

586
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
People even if they're gullible I still care about them

587
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Consumers who does

588
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
Protection

589
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
Funny story is already

590
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,144
It's a 10 value in the first

591
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
You selling

592
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Like guides

593
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
It's on how to build your own

594
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Oh okay

595
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:59,136
Do you think progress article the guy talks to experts in the field

596
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,184
Is this something that you could do

597
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,536
No

598
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,888
Yeah

599
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
It would be

600
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Much cheaper to

601
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
You just buy solar power

602
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
Time to try and build your own

603
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
The parts that you would need

604
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,616
Ridiculous

605
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
So anyways

606
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
I don't know

607
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
An advertisement analysis up to

608
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
No good

609
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
Real fun

610
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,720
No good and real

611
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Alex

612
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Hezekiah

613
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
On the show on the toy

614
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,400
It's the first time ever

615
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
Interesting

616
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,776
So he's been on the Nightly News

617
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
Infowars

618
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
The Infowars

619
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
He's been kicked he's been called up to

620
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
To the Major League

621
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
CS

622
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,504
It's kind of interesting of course

623
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
The guy who runs

624
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Veritas

625
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,344
Has become a very big

626
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,928
Regularly

627
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
I can't speak to that in 2019

628
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
But up until 2018

629
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,888
He was definitely around pretty regularly

630
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,728
Alex would promote dumb scam

631
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,800
I did eat the part of being forward

632
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,128
Consistently

633
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
Flabbergasted anytime his name

634
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Comes up

635
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Atheism

636
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,088
Every time it comes up I'm like

637
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,416
The jail right now he's still making

638
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:16,864
Alex can really pull from memory that

639
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Is John is going

640
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
2 Acorn Drive

641
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Does a pimp

642
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
There's there's no reason

643
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Positively

644
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
2013

645
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
Seeing about what James O'Keefe did with acorn

646
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
Which is

647
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
The association

648
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
Community organizers for reform now

649
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Yeah that's one of the most

650
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,320
F***** up your b*******

651
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:41,952
He should be and we'll get you another reason why I should be in a little bit

652
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:46,816
People do you forget about it cuz of all the other f*****-up Pikachu

653
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,168
So after those videos were released I became the biggest f****** thing in the conservative world

654
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,752
Obama had just won the 2008 election

655
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,288
To find ways to attack

656
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,640
And one of them was the accusation to Acorn had engaged in voter fraud

657
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
Which is just the GOP code for helping poor

658
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,784
Voter fraud which is what the GOP

659
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
The videos that O'Keefe made were not investigate

660
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,928
Received a plant carried out in

661
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,256
An edited specifically with the explicit purpose of smearing acorn

662
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
Set in stone

663
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
From the

664
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,192
Those videos were manipulative re-edited to such an absurd absurd

665
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,032
Alex remembers about the video isn't

666
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Real

667
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
James O'Keefe didn't go to a court dress

668
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Does a 70s pimp

669
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
With a girl dressed like

670
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
The prostitute

671
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,760
They showed up and talk to people what you might call business casual attire

672
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
But later

673
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Frost

674
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,952
Institute in order to make if you were think that all the interviews as they were happening

675
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,512
Buy whip it when they were talking today

676
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
They want you to think

677
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
That they were drafted

678
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
As a pimp

679
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,936
Person was engaged with someone dressed like that

680
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
It's a false framing of the videos

681
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
It's the only detail that Alex remember

682
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,616
We know

683
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,176
Is an edited together the acorn employees answers

684
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,504
To make them look bad because I was forced

685
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
Release all the unedited footage in order to avoid being charged

686
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,880
Illegally recording people without their consent

687
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
Crime

688
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
I-10

689
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
This is clearly

690
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,304
You are leading them down roads

691
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:30,240
Glad to know that all of the video footage came out and he was discredited of course

692
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Never paid attention

693
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:37,152
Everybody remembers acorn

694
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
Conservative lies

695
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Investigations were launched

696
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
Acorn which consists

697
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,880
Show me found no wrongdoing on the part of the organization and its employees

698
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,976
Done just by the appearance created by these f****** Liars

699
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,072
And the GOP successfully pushed for defunding of acorn before the investigations are

700
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
Concluded

701
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
As the gop's used Acorn to attack Democrats

702
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
Themselves or failed

703
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,800
Stand up for the organizations which ultimately led to take

704
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,872
Close up shop

705
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,480
Close up shop because they were unable to

706
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Insufficient funds

707
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,272
Together mission

708
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Especially with it

709
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:27,072
In America the right mix it up and the left is libel

710
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
Call that normal people lose their f******

711
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
Care about possible human traffic

712
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
Navigating or voter fraud when he made this video

713
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,872
His goal was to make Acorn unable to do the work they did

714
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
Because it was a threat

715
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
To the right wing

716
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
His actions

717
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Constitutive intentional militia

718
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Attack on voting rights

719
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,808
But in the process he also managed

720
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
The shutter group that help people receive

721
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
Fair wages for work

722
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Receive a quality at

723
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Education

724
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
Consults for predatory loan

725
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
Ultimately the Legacy

726
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Work is

727
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,328
Crippling a group that existed

728
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
To help the poor

729
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Congratulation

730
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
The acorn videos were a big

731
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,776
Success is probably because of Andrew Breitbart

732
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
Who discovered okay

733
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,104
He's an amplified his work and put him on retainer

734
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
Basically for Breitbart

735
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
It's really hard to look at the sort of

736
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
Failed stunts that O'Keefe

737
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
For this

738
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,552
And how consistently you stink

739
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Completely Fall Apart

740
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,624
To the point of breitbart's death

741
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
And not think that Andrew sensibilities

742
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,000
Really had a ton for the acorn camp

743
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
It was the tutelage

744
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Mentorship

745
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,144
Of someone who was good at

746
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Keith is coasting

747
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
On that one win

748
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
To the present day

749
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Constantly has ship blow up

750
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,176
Like that Roy Moore thing that you tried to pull with the Washington Post

751
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,504
Completely

752
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:56,928
Everybody's discredit in forever and nobody's ever going to pay

753
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Do we have it

754
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
It's fun now that we can

755
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
F****** bang on

756
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:08,960
What is that is named Delta work is Laura Loomer

757
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,800
I don't think either Breitbart likes Alex G

758
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,688
There was ample opportunity for him to be a guest on Alex's before he died and he never did come on

759
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,040
They're working for similar propaganda goals natural allies

760
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,112
Andrew Breitbart didn't want anything

761
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
To do without

762
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
Explain why

763
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,488
The 2009 Acorn videos

764
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
Keep watch Don Alex

765
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
To show either

766
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,840
His bread was buttered by Andrew Breitbart

767
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
Breitbart

768
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,984
And here is okay spreading his wings a little bit apeirogon Alex

769
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
All the people we run into

770
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
This show

771
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
I think I have the least

772
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Respect for James

773
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,176
Is only for how much work he puts

774
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Sent to doing absolutely

775
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,784
His goals are always destructive vulnerable

776
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,344
His plans almost always fall apart

777
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Raymore

778
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
Someone like Alex does with his work

779
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Tepeyac

780
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
Dealt there people who are evil

781
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
But somehow the fact

782
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,728
James O'Keefe

783
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
Singles him out in my mind

784
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
4

785
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
Particularly

786
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
I f****** hate

787
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,432
Wylie Coyote

788
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
The Roadrunner in just was punch

789
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
If he would presently

790
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
Coyote for quite a while coyotes backstory was one

791
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
Could someone else help

792
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
I don't know

793
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Do it

794
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
You know this is a

795
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,336
A bad interview and it's mostly

796
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
Yeah because

797
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
Track what's going on in this

798
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
13.

799
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
Typically it's about trying to figure out

800
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Cook stuff

801
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
Appearances

802
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Really

803
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,951
It's just about Alex screaming

804
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
About

805
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
James O'Keefe

806
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,535
Being great and being a real journalist

807
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
Figure that

808
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,399
But there is one point that I thought was really into

809
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
That is

810
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
He got in trouble for

811
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
In the past

812
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
He's completely lying

813
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
About this situation

814
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,247
20

815
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
Camera

816
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
In Louisiana

817
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
Bass

818
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
We're going to have to

819
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
Prison

820
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
None of that is

821
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Charger

822
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Ridiculous

823
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
It is actually

824
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:38,623
He's got arrested for what he did to Mary Landrieu

825
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
Felony

826
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,463
He's damn lucky

827
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
Do hard time

828
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:50,143
Really mad about that prison for this guy's never go to it

829
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:56,543
These darn like that one time we tried to lure a reporter on his boat

830
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
For whatever

831
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,895
Seducer

832
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Creepy as hell tonight

833
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,295
Wake me up maybe you should go to prison for that but this one for sure

834
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,183
You claim that a bunch of people have told him that they weren't able to

835
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
Slander you

836
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
U.s. Senator Louisiana

837
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
Land claims that people are having difficulty

838
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Because the phone

839
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
Work quotes

840
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,703
There was a hot-button issue in terms of healthcare

841
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
Being discussed at that point back

842
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,567
Which would increase volume

843
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,407
O'Keefe decided to interpret this explanation of the phones being

844
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,735
Is actually

845
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
The problem with her phone Sis

846
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
Helium-3 friend

847
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,623
The dress up like telephone repairman

848
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
And why their way into her office

849
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
Which is super Elite

850
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,047
That's called entering a federal building under false pretenses

851
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:56,191
Once inside according to the FBI manipulated the telephone system

852
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,775
Which led some to believe that their true intention was to bug her phone

853
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
You can't do that

854
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
You can't

855
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,175
Even like

856
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
Like you couldn't come

857
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,759
Here and manipulate your phone device

858
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:18,207
Okay tonight that's what he was doing but

859
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
She said her phones were really busy

860
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
So they dress up like telephone employees

861
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,375
What the phone system to prove the phones aren't receiving

862
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
Don't really make a lot of sense

863
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
Text but it make a ton

864
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
Illegally Tapper phone

865
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
And here's the thing

866
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,919
Tap the phones it would have just been her phone

867
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,223
While they were there on there

868
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,759
They tried to access the

869
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Entire buildings phone

870
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,343
Closet which would have given the max

871
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,135
Too many of the phone lines in the building

872
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
I remember this is the f****** Federal Building

873
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,999
Other officials government organizations and

874
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Judges

875
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
Had their office is in that building

876
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
It's pretty f***** up to consider what

877
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
Could have possibly been up to

878
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,519
Ultimately O'Keefe plead guilty to entering a federal building under false

879
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
I'm kind of like SB

880
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,383
Rihanna's chart

881
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
Tapiz Senators phone

882
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
I'm pretty sure that's like

883
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
Borderline

884
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Treason level

885
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Love like

886
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
Nope

887
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,903
Situation where they were

888
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
Incompetent

889
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,975
To a level

890
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:29,375
Like the Mueller report says about Trump stupid

891
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
Erik Prince

892
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,775
Was talkin not too long ago about project

893
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
Yeah I couldn't

894
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151
They were unteachable

895
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,479
That's 23 years probation

896
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
100 hours of

897
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
Community service and a $1,500

898
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
This is just one of the many in

899
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,159
In his career at emptying

900
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
The living embodiment

901
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Of the white privilege

902
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
He insists.

903
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,791
Because anybody else

904
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Caught

905
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
In the situation

906
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
And if he was caught in

907
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,655
Would not we wouldn't know about

908
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:15,711
What year did Guantanamo stop taking new people

909
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,527
When the next president

910
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
So

911
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,367
Hours earlier said that

912
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
You know the Piers Morgan thing was

913
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,951
Biggest media events of the last year

914
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,047
He's got a media guy on the show now a great

915
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,351
He's got to know

916
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Thanks

917
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
About Alex's appearance

918
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Morgan show

919
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,103
Morgan appearance

920
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:48,479
No I don't doubt

921
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
Translation

922
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,311
I would like some of that attention

923
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
California

924
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
Cool, right

925
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,511
Playwap

926
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:48,639
Wards.com

927
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:57,087
So we got there is basically Alex offering to pay James O'Keefe to harass Piers Morgan

928
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,999
I don't know what to do with that of Alex

929
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
Whatever he absolutely

930
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Fixates on one thing

931
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,655
About what anybody else

932
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,239
Trying to interject

933
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Nothing else seems like

934
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
He's like

935
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
He's not at the chicken back

936
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Of course

937
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,743
So

938
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:40,607
Going over to

939
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Two Piers Morgan's house

940
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
On the one hand he's a public figure

941
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,055
I think if there is a legitimate

942
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,103
Argument of it being

943
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
But I don't

944
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,919
I don't know how against did I am

945
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,223
As long as it's done with it like not you

946
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
You're not going to go on his private property

947
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,855
Cuz you're demonstrating outside his house isn't on the street

948
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:11,327
Appropriately

949
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
Applied to Piers Morgan

950
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,471
Any kind of feel like there's a little bit of a

951
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
The next one

952
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,151
Room or gray area code

953
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:05,599
Smart

954
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,927
School

955
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,959
You guys have done that so I guess you don't care that much by Prince book

956
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,751
I want to say

957
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,311
With or without going to the school

958
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,383
This conversation on the show does

959
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
All the deck

960
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,247
Which is put focus on this school

961
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,855
It's really f***** up to hear these dude say that sort of thing and act like

962
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,903
Some kind of acceptable gun-rights advocate

963
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
Isn't what they're

964
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
Even if

965
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,535
I'm confused but yeah

966
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,095
Even in school shootings were a very real issue

967
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:52,191
And even if there were an actual movement happening to take away people's guns

968
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:57,055
What they're joking about is making a public spectacle of a school where children

969
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
To learn

970
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,687
Sidwell school is not just a little house where Obama and Dick Gregory's children

971
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Private instruction

972
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
It's a place where over 1,000 kids getting education

973
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
And with classes

974
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,575
From preschool through High School

975
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,695
Even if you don't cause someone to view the school as a target for an attack by these sorts of

976
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:18,047
Conversations supposed hypothetical

977
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,839
Buy single get out in

978
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
Creating a media storm

979
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,911
You are hurting children

980
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
Because here's the thing

981
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,983
That's cool is already at Target

982
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,287
And going through with this. Like what O'Keefe is

983
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,359
Describing is only playing into that and exacerbating the issue

984
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,991
October 18th 2012 Sidwell school was evacuated

985
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,039
October 2nd 2014

986
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
The school was evacuated after

987
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
Discovery of a suspicious package

988
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,695
Coming on the heels of the White House fence Arbor with a knife

989
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:51,839
Beginning in the 2008 primaries if not before

990
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Deathreat

991
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
Do not limit themselves to just the present

992
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
And for James to protect

993
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
He's not aware of that is

994
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Pathetic

995
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Miramonte

996
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,919
Before this interview

997
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,479
And that will keep his on air

998
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Casually joking about

999
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
Things that would obviously lie

1000
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
To that happening

1001
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
A bunch more

1002
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
Irresponsible

1003
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
It's just that

1004
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:20,511
It's that I don't understand

1005
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,559
Okay so

1006
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Here's their plan

1007
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,143
They're going to go to this school

1008
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,983
And just put an advertisement saying this event

1009
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
So the idea being

1010
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,335
When they are shot up

1011
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
You'll get to go

1012
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:39,199
See look at how smart we are we told you told you

1013
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:45,599
But he's saying like hey I'm going to put this sign here saying there's no guns

1014
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,903
But I'll probably be arrested by the Secret Service

1015
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,487
Right there armed guards everywhere

1016
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,423
Rhetoric like the stuff you put out into the world

1017
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,031
Ultimate

1018
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Stunt

1019
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
There

1020
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,783
Desired outcome

1021
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
To be there being guns

1022
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
But

1023
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,439
Be likely or outcome

1024
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
If people

1025
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
Seating at school

1026
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Jesus

1027
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Yeah

1028
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,871
I find it tough to argue that that's not leave the functional out

1029
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
What they're talking

1030
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
If

1031
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,991
Speak to intentions

1032
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,063
But it does seem like that would be the logical

1033
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,367
So

1034
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
You know

1035
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,207
We're going to jump off

1036
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
From the 24th

1037
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
Just have a long conversation about nothing

1038
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,887
I don't care

1039
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,959
So we get off the 24th and we jumping out of the 25th

1040
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
To be about

1041
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Sandy Hook

1042
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,127
Stuff where bad things happened

1043
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,199
Analysis coverage where is

1044
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,759
January 25th

1045
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
Might be

1046
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,319
A crucial Turning Point

1047
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
Then Alex's career

1048
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
Because he

1049
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
He says that

1050
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
So

1051
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,087
Detect

1052
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,647
But you can tell that there's some sort of a mastiff

1053
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,231
And he doesn't say what it is on this show

1054
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
Episode

1055
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:07,167
News to try and figure out what you talk about

1056
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
No

1057
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
So we don't find out what that isn't a little bit late

1058
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
On this episode

1059
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,687
I watch the f****** episode of the Nightly News

1060
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
So in this next clip Alex has a big

1061
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Is

1062
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,159
I can't even tell you how

1063
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,695
Game

1064
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
Alex is running a contest

1065
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,351
I said I would announce a few weeks ago I just been too busy

1066
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:43,519
$15,000

1067
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,663
Cash prize

1068
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,503
A big drop box

1069
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,543
Shrink from work

1070
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,359
Charlie Sheen

1071
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:37,279
I would rather

1072
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,119
Do the Doritos. That dumbass

1073
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
Alex Jones

1074
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:49,823
I can confirm that Alex did actually named a winner in the contest

1075
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,431
Surprised because I can

1076
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,967
Can find out who this person is

1077
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
Baby crying bloody murder

1078
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
Valic

1079
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:05,951
It July 2013 Alex name the short film called Purge the winner of the operation

1080
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Paul Revere contest

1081
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
I watched it

1082
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
And mad

1083
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,095
I can't imagine how bad the other entries must have been

1084
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,983
I bet the other

1085
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,519
Silver for

1086
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,919
It started to make me think of how much I would love to do one where I just breakdown

1087
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
GTA V

1088
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,599
Critical review of this film Purge

1089
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:38,719
But I repeat I watched it's only like 18 minutes

1090
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,743
I'm going to start with deposit

1091
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,071
It appears that the film was shot with actual camera

1092
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
That's about it

1093
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,471
Bowser -

1094
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,007
The acting is s***

1095
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,079
The writing is laughable and Buddy

1096
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,151
It kind of implies that people need to start killing government age

1097
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,991
Sounded like from the name being purged

1098
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
And if Alex

1099
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623
Chose this is the winner

1100
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:17,119
Gunsmoke

1101
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,399
But here goes

1102
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,727
The short film begins at a meeting of the Homeland Security

1103
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:26,591
Group of like eight people who have unspecified jobs

1104
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,127
He's giving a description

1105
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,991
Situations the dhs's spacing

1106
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
Imagining what DHHS and their beatings would be like

1107
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:40,927
Terrorist terrorist

1108
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Sure

1109
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,743
Every time someone in the meeting Express

1110
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,535
The disapproval of what's being said

1111
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,375
Are the speaker Whispers in German to his assistant is it to imply that there Nazi

1112
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Gotcha

1113
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,959
The people in the group grow Restless

1114
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,031
They talk back there sent to the other

1115
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:02,431
The other we go to the other room to finish their training with the American people are good

1116
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,831
And another one is sent to the other room for reading and Infowars magazine in the middle of the meeting

1117
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,927
When asked what he's doing he replies getting some real intelligence

1118
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,975
It's a Shameless plug

1119
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:27,007
That was my first I want to let you know that I love your product

1120
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,823
It's

1121
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,383
Embarrassing in the context of the short sale

1122
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
But

1123
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
Yeah you get Wyatt

1124
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
Extremists in there

1125
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,855
Sector to follow the given

1126
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
People

1127
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
What are the ages

1128
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
Decides to

1129
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Call what-have-you

1130
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
Extremist she has a file on

1131
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,743
Extremist

1132
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,303
Which is crazy

1133
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
A call to him is

1134
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,143
Laughably written is it a pile of

1135
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Quote

1136
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,471
This is Agent

1137
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
DHHS

1138
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:02,079
I'm concerned about an operation but dhs's conductor and I wonder

1139
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,127
If I can get some more information from you

1140
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Okay

1141
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,343
Okay

1142
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,951
Dresses up to something f***** up

1143
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,279
Can I ask you some questions are you an evil person

1144
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
You're not that was you saying no

1145
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,287
Nami evil person

1146
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,639
Meet up and buy him a beer

1147
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:40,223
Skittish about it but they agree to meet up

1148
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
Presumably for sale

1149
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:46,623
Going to kill those kids

1150
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
Seward idealized version of

1151
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:01,471
I think they are

1152
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,519
Veteran veteran

1153
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,335
He's cool as a cucumber with a well-trimmed beard

1154
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,407
Of course he's portrayed by the director of the

1155
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,015
The town of Federal Reserve talking points Robin

1156
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,807
Red pills the f*** out of her

1157
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,159
Anyone not trapped in the Infowars delusion

1158
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
Put in the film

1159
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,207
He's a prophet

1160
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:28,095
All his ramblings end up coming true and the rest of the movie plays out pretty much exactly like

1161
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
Dramatization

1162
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,471
The extremist was actually right about everything

1163
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,751
You get the heads up message

1164
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
They're coming

1165
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,103
But you misspelled there I asked

1166
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
Their

1167
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,199
Come on

1168
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,623
The short ends with agent Robbins following the age

1169
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,207
Percent to rowley's house

1170
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,511
She follows them there and killed

1171
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:01,375
Another agent who spoke up at the meeting got sent to the other room

1172
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
DHS office

1173
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
And starts killing

1174
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,775
Okay it's a really f***** up ending probably exactly what Alex was looking for

1175
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Ya-hey

1176
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
I'm all for free speech and artistic

1177
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,895
Expression and all that but I would be remiss

1178
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:19,295
I didn't point out how f*****-up a fictional short film that is like this exist on a platform

1179
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,367
This isn't Affliction to the Infowars audio

1180
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,415
So when things reach their natural

1181
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
Conclusion

1182
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:31,839
People in the short start murdering the Department of Homeland Security people it's hard not to imagine that his audience

1183
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,143
That is a happy resolution to the story

1184
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,239
Unsurprisingly according to IMDb the director Michael Dorman

1185
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,311
Corner of Show Business you might describe as

1186
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Infowars O'Jays

1187
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,383
Self-produced short film

1188
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
So

1189
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:50,015
It's really sucked up the twist at the end of them murdering a bunch of

1190
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,879
Kind of got a little bit of a flutter

1191
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
Lycos anxiety

1192
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,511
Because it came out of nowhere

1193
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,095
Cuz I would be the

1194
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,167
Courage would be of the DHHS employees

1195
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,447
Stood up

1196
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
The Patriot

1197
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,591
Fulfilling the paranoia

1198
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
As opposed

1199
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
To the

1200
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,431
Murdering government employees fan

1201
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,223
It was weird

1202
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,647
The paranoia didn't really make

1203
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
No

1204
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,767
Murdered

1205
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:37,631
Patriots

1206
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
Like in the

1207
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:46,591
JS people didn't just go to Roland Vick man

1208
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,639
Like his paranoid

1209
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Is did come true

1210
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:53,247
He was only spared by the fact that agent Robbins calls in

1211
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
Let you know

1212
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,647
Like a bunch of people still got rolled up

1213
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,207
Isn't that what you wish to avoid

1214
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:06,815
Well the way to avoid before that

1215
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,095
Seems like that's a

1216
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,375
Pretty logical

1217
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
Thing to take away from

1218
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,727
My other logic

1219
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
Clearly

1220
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,335
These people

1221
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,383
Think that they are some level of hero

1222
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,175
And that Z100

1223
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
Are capable of red

1224
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:29,855
Other.

1225
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,415
The first part of that strategy

1226
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,975
Where they call up all these guys and go

1227
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,815
Tell me more about yourself and what you want to do

1228
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,631
I'm part of the team

1229
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:51,359
And then they'll reveal themselves in the real world how it would play

1230
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,431
Is the agent calls this guy meet up

1231
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,455
The guy suck

1232
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:01,087
Thinking it's a setup or something

1233
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,623
I or

1234
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,463
I don't know he gets seen with a DHS agent nose Patriot Buddies

1235
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
Thank you that's nature

1236
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:13,119
Should kill him

1237
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
What's the plot of the story is

1238
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Defense

1239
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,751
The Purge that happens isn't ever going to happen

1240
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
So

1241
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:24,127
What is going to happen though is somebody shooting up

1242
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
Office

1243
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
That's what they say

1244
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
It does

1245
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,015
It does seem like a

1246
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
Impossible

1247
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:36,671
Fallout company

1248
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Yeah

1249
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
Be created by

1250
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,255
I don't know free speech

1251
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,047
The make whatever kind of art you want to make

1252
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:46,911
But shame on you

1253
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,703
What's guns being for

1254
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,055
They always create these Fantastical scenarios where in

1255
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
Now it's Justified

1256
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:59,199
All my self-defense rules or are met so now I get to

1257
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,991
Go out

1258
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
90% of Alex

1259
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,831
Cuz rhetoric boils down to when you just get

1260
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,135
Deep enough for you when you follow the thread

1261
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,415
To the end of it there

1262
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
Justified viola

1263
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,327
So

1264
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,863
Gatsby comes in here on the

1265
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
25th

1266
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,703
In the present

1267
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Jerome corsi

1268
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
All right and the two of them

1269
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
Sit down

1270
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
It is like a date

1271
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:32,735
It is going well this is before he

1272
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
Because I hate

1273
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
They got great

1274
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
Fantastic

1275
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,647
Corsi is a yes

1276
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:45,791
So Alex will say something chords he's like you

1277
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
They have a momentum

1278
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,215
BB Charter

1279
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,287
Alex

1280
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,591
Whereas Corsican ham have

1281
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,383
Electric

1282
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,943
And that makes this very hard to

1283
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
To cut clips

1284
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,551
Because they just go all over the place

1285
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
Rainbow

1286
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
Mostly about China

1287
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Okay

1288
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:19,071
Going to go

1289
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,423
Equity

1290
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,751
Parts of United States

1291
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:39,039
China wants his arm United States

1292
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,391
Absolutely

1293
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,815
Siri

1294
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:56,959
Bankruptcy plan

1295
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:03,103
Yeah if you ever heard that song Cuttin heads by the Riza nodb

1296
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,503
Weather like trade in line

1297
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
Really rolling with his energy

1298
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,047
Yeah

1299
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
I mean because of who they are

1300
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,935
Just sounds like

1301
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:32,031
Find me a little bit like he's got a cold

1302
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:37,919
Eddie has this like a up and down whenever we talk

1303
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,223
Pretty much

1304
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Let's discuss

1305
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
It's not

1306
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,743
Collateral for the day

1307
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,047
They're going to take over and that's why

1308
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
You take the guns away right

1309
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
And then

1310
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
The cloward and Piven

1311
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
Stuff

1312
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,007
Corsi talking a little bit more about the cloud

1313
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
Am I talking about

1314
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,151
With

1315
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
Now

1316
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:26,559
New York in the 70s with this idea

1317
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,239
Socialism

1318
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,591
Just being

1319
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
True at all

1320
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:45,759
First of all cloward and Piven ever been enacted

1321
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,039
By anybody

1322
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,855
And the cloward and Piven

1323
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
We talked about this way back

1324
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:55,231
Remind

1325
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
Episodes

1326
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,559
It was a plan that a couple of sociology

1327
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Suggested

1328
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
And the motivation

1329
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,167
For it was the realization

1330
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
Who are living

1331
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
Poverty level

1332
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,543
That aren't

1333
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Taking

1334
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,639
Which of social

1335
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
Programs

1336
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
I was probably eligible for

1337
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,575
Take advantage of

1338
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
That program

1339
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,903
Suggesting was

1340
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
People

1341
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,487
Being made aware

1342
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,535
Qualify for

1343
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
So that they would sign up

1344
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,375
I'm so it would become a very

1345
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,399
Large prop

1346
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,239
Was not to bankrupt

1347
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,519
Estate

1348
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
The country

1349
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
What it was was to draw attention

1350
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:46,175
To the idea that there are so many people who are living in abject poverty

1351
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
It was an attempt

1352
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
To make

1353
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
The system

1354
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
Make the government

1355
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,319
Recognize

1356
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
The tremendous

1357
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,623
Size of

1358
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,927
The problem by making it their problem

1359
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,487
That's what it was

1360
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,511
And it's never been

1361
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,559
Enacted

1362
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
It wasn't designed to

1363
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Bankrupt

1364
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
Anybody it was designed

1365
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
To make

1366
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,983
Recognize

1367
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,055
The problem that citizens were living at

1368
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
The desperate

1369
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:14,847
Straight

1370
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,151
And the only way

1371
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
To pay more money

1372
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
I want to

1373
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,831
Well at least that's what they say

1374
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
I am so whatever

1375
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,903
I know course he doesn't want

1376
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
People

1377
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
To survive

1378
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,511
So great

1379
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,047
Poor people suck haha

1380
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,375
Jerome corsi

1381
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
Like I said

1382
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,447
Firework

1383
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,127
It was way better listening to them

1384
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:52,223
Because the more course he talked by himself

1385
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,807
Opposite of vocal fry wherever

1386
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,087
He will end the sentence

1387
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,183
And he's going to talk to you all the way all the way

1388
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:02,975
Boring

1389
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,999
Dude

1390
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,279
Nosebleed

1391
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
So

1392
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
Keeps going through the show

1393
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
And it really upset me

1394
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
Because

1395
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,287
Is trying to screw

1396
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
The law

1397
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,383
What time advocate

1398
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
Keep his audience stop taking

1399
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:22,943
Which is

1400
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
Credibly

1401
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
Or over the horizon

1402
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,007
Stop it

1403
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,871
Psychologist

1404
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
Is

1405
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,487
Much of him saying get off your meds

1406
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,071
Wildin

1407
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,631
The awake doctors that we've talked to

1408
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,215
Veterinarians

1409
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,495
For the most part

1410
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,287
Saudi

1411
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Is so f****** response

1412
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:31,039
The medication then go off at cold turkey

1413
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,599
But even

1414
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,135
Unless you're under the care of a doctor

1415
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
This kind of flipping houses

1416
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
Super dangerous

1417
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,999
Even their life

1418
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,791
The person that he's talking

1419
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,583
We'll talk to him

1420
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:48,191
Talk about it

1421
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,751
That would be wrong

1422
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
It's a pharmacist

1423
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
The name of Ben

1424
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
5

1425
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,151
Alex interview

1426
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
Easy answer

1427
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,247
Because board member of youngevity

1428
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:06,111
The supplement company was one of Alex's main sponsor

1429
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,207
Beautiful

1430
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,743
Also been accused

1431
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:15,327
I host a show called Brightside Communications Network

1432
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
Talk about synergy

1433
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:23,263
It's important to point out that has a license.

1434
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,543
Don't have a doctor

1435
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,823
Or any kind of advanced

1436
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,871
Degree in the field or in any other

1437
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,175
He has a Bachelor of Arts

1438
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
In broadcast

1439
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
Open pharmacies

1440
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,831
I'm taking that information from his own bio on his own website

1441
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
You should also know that

1442
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,719
In 2011 the accreditation Council for the pharmacy education

1443
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,767
The organization

1444
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,047
Policy

1445
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,863
Postgraduate degree

1446
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Quiet

1447
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,911
For someone to be eligible to take

1448
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,959
The North American pharmacist license

1449
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,263
Ensure examination

1450
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,359
Doesn't qualify

1451
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
To try to

1452
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,735
Because I a doctor at a pharmacy degree is required to

1453
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,783
To become a pharmacist

1454
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,855
Schools in the United States don't even offer a bachelor Pharmacy

1455
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,903
As an accredited saying any

1456
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,255
Degree in 1986

1457
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,791
But doesn't exist anymore

1458
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,119
It doesn't even qualify him to pursue a career in the field of being a farm

1459
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,935
This man has zero qualifications

1460
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,471
Dispensing medical advice

1461
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:29,311
He has at least two conflicts of interest with doing so on Alex's show

1462
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,591
But that's the thing

1463
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,383
He's not here to give medical advice

1464
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,431
He's here to sell youngevity

1465
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,247
He doesn't give a f*** about the people who might be hurt

1466
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,319
By Alex using him to Advocate that his listeners go off their meds

1467
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,391
And most people throw it away I can possibly Express this

1468
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,183
F*** you been few

1469
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
That you can do that

1470
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:53,375
And I really don't think okay like she can just go

1471
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,679
Represented as an X

1472
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
And then

1473
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:06,175
587

1474
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:11,039
Undoubtedly causing harm upon harm upon

1475
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,159
Use less

1476
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
Irresponsible about an hour

1477
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,231
At least

1478
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,023
Couches so much of it in like

1479
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,815
You know what the great if you're depressed

1480
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,583
Sunlight

1481
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,351
Yeah

1482
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,143
So yeah

1483
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,447
What makes

1484
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
Even worse

1485
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
Is this is f******

1486
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,519
Paid time

1487
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,567
But you know how I know that

1488
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,615
Because listen to this clip

1489
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,895
Benfield

1490
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,175
Pharmacist Ben

1491
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
The question

1492
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,743
This is just

1493
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,351
Your show I've told you what I want you to ask

1494
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,911
Mia's setups for me to go into whatever

1495
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,751
It was next with Alex talks about his

1496
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,543
Get off your meds

1497
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,615
X his question about getting off your bed

1498
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,151
Varies

1499
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,311
The weather

1500
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:42,943
Started off as a question

1501
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
So he can introduce these ID

1502
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,903
Cabana outdoor pharmacist been out a little bit like

1503
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,255
With

1504
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,535
What he saying

1505
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,583
But doesn't give him any time tours

1506
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,655
Respond

1507
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,191
Supposed to

1508
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:04,959
You got it

1509
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,007
Let that happen again

1510
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,847
Who's Mike was probably off

1511
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,175
Becky realizes he's been ran

1512
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,015
Little bit

1513
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
2

1514
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,111
Leave the studio so Ben can talk

1515
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,679
Tryptophan

1516
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,847
Who's who's

1517
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,895
You don't want people getting tripped

1518
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,991
Government

1519
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
Actively

1520
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:56,415
Eroding our Thanksgiving being against vegetarian war on Chris

1521
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,975
I've Dan really not sure

1522
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,791
Alex

1523
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,071
Some folks

1524
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
From his past

1525
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,631
And also simultaneously

1526
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,952
No Alex the crazy thought.

1527
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,744
It's

1528
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,560
So

1529
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,096
Talking about youngevity

1530
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
Product

1531
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
It's just

1532
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,776
You hear him

1533
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:49,920
Ben say things like

1534
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
Care to discuss

1535
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:01,184
Is medical claim

1536
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
You can hear

1537
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,608
Dot-com

1538
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,936
Polymers Plus

1539
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,696
Dot-com

1540
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
Well

1541
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,936
Relaxation response

1542
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:29,248
I also I do like the idea for that because

1543
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,320
Anybody else

1544
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,856
Stole

1545
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,904
Because this girl

1546
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:39,744
Because this guy is paying for his time on the show I was at the let him him

1547
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,144
Funeral almost sounded like a little petulant when I was like

1548
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,424
Who's going to get out of the studio

1549
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,520
Because it's like this isn't my time.

1550
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,848
It wasn't petulance but what you're saying is

1551
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,872
Is

1552
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:00,224
Like I don't know this time

1553
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,040
Hot and bothered about telling people to stop taking their bed

1554
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
I think that was

1555
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,904
Do you like this

1556
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,184
Broker program

1557
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,464
But it wasn't

1558
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,768
Like it wasn't him

1559
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,144
Correctly God what I'm distinction

1560
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
Sing that is

1561
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,288
Is even while he sang like

1562
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,408
They're going to tell you

1563
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,200
Maybe you should stay on it

1564
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:33,760
Also

1565
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:38,112
Going there you know you're going to get the wrong answer

1566
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,928
Right now Alex isn't telling you that it's the wrong

1567
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
We're going to give you the wrong

1568
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
Sounds right

1569
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,728
Much like

1570
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,288
Pharmacist

1571
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616

1572
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
ISO

1573
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,712
Psychiatrist

1574
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
You should probably

1575
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,296
Be more specific

1576
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,672
There's a real Trend that's going on that Pharmacy

1577
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,208
Trying to present

1578
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,488
Himself

1579
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
You Scientist

1580
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,048
Perfect terms

1581
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,608
Gives you the etymology of Serotonin

1582
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
Not right about it

1583
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,704
He's trying to

1584
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,728
Scholarly

1585
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,032
Real scientific and medical

1586
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,688
Alex is getting weird

1587
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,712
East close

1588
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,496
Retaliation

1589
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:02,336
Eastern religions is just to calm people down

1590
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:05,920
You that are receptors for messages

1591
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:09,760
I got to go I got to go Alex I don't know

1592
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,600
That is not a corsi level

1593
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,672
They got along well cuz youngevity pay the bills

1594
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
Of course

1595
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,168
That was the 25th that was Friday

1596
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,472
And

1597
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,752
Beginning of the 25th

1598
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:35,360
He's on the Nightly News there's going to be big breaking news about Sandy Hook

1599
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:39,200
And did not have

1600
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,504
So because

1601
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,600
We're doing this episode and I knew that Alex said

1602
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
In from the Nightly News

1603
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,256
Will be good that'll make the episode whatever

1604
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,536
I watch the Nightly News

1605
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:56,352
It's nothing on there like well now I got to listen to someday

1606
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,936
Geo and says what the news

1607
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,704
Is

1608
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,264
Here is Alex

1609
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,288
Coming in on

1610
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,784
Yeah we got that right

1611
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,320
So

1612
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,368
That gave me a

1613
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,648
We're in for something

1614
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:24,512
Promising

1615
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,304
Do that immediately because he's got others

1616
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,328
Things to write about

1617
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,680
Impeachment

1618
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,496
If you had any kind of moral clarity

1619
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,032
And intellectual

1620
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,480
Wars

1621
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,272
Dot-com

1622
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
Area

1623
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,520
So if you're going to

1624
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,568
To complain about speaking fees and

1625
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,384
That that's

1626
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
Alex

1627
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,272
Jimmy Carter sold his f****** small-time

1628
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:55,904
Sheep farm just so you would be in violation of the emoluments clause

1629
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,440
Also

1630
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,488
Pretty sure that you have to be British

1631
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:05,888
Benighted I think that there is a difference of the state

1632
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:09,728
Still upon you like a friend or something like that

1633
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,312
Right

1634
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,336
You have to be British

1635
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
Anyway

1636
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,712
So we get now to the big news

1637
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,480
About that

1638
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,344
Nice Alex's

1639
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,392
I thought that was an actual

1640
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:30,976
I don't think that was intentional but it does

1641
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
Speak to wear his

1642
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:37,120
Yeah that sounds like he's speaking New York Post headlines now or it's just Sandy hoax

1643
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:41,472
?

1644
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:48,640
Confirm

1645
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,480
Screen

1646
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:57,600
That's the one

1647
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:08,608
Conspiracy

1648
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,896
I'll show you the rest.

1649
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:25,504
So it's the CNN Anderson Cooper video

1650
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,040
That is very well explained

1651
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,088
And as shaken Alex

1652
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:33,184
He wasn't going there with the actor stuff but now everything is changed

1653
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,512
He has turned the corner here on January 27th

1654
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,280
2013

1655
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,632
This is pathetic

1656
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
Him

1657
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,192
Having an egg

1658
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,216
Exasperated

1659
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:45,984
Tone

1660
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
When he says

1661
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,336
No Alex

1662
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:55,456
No it doesn't everything have to be an opportunity for your tickets for the money

1663
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:59,040
You're the reason it's hard also not to hear this

1664
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,624
Only a couple days

1665
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:08,512
James Tracy on recognize the profitability

1666
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:13,120
A million views and also a few days after Alex did that

1667
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:16,192
Durable display with the Lone Star College shooting

1668
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:16,960
Like it

1669
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,496
It's really hard not to

1670
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
See this

1671
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
Video

1672
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
The CNN

1673
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,664
Cooper video is being more of an excuse

1674
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,224
It is actually

1675
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
To Alex

1676
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,808
It does it does feel a little artificial

1677
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,344
So

1678
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,392
Still a little bit

1679
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,416
You can tell that something

1680
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,464
The direction of iskcon

1681
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,512
Towards

1682
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,792
Actors

1683
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,400
I show you the rest of stuff

1684
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,960
What's going on

1685
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Sources

1686
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,392
Which makes me think you're not real

1687
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,464
Because we

1688
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:15,584
So he's got he's got whatever pivot he's going towards

1689
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:25,568
Because August 27th Alex get the collar

1690
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,104
Towards

1691
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
The show

1692
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
And

1693
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,968
This guy might be someone who Alex is a real source

1694
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,368
Alex

1695
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,904

01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
Oh

1710
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,120
Interesting

1711
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:27,520
Pictures in 2013

1712
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,544
Calling in with

1713
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,152
Proof of an imminent false flag attack in Syria

1714
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,688
Betty's

1715
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,456
Fortune

1716
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,784
So this color is trying to

1717
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,064
This

1718
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,832
Fishing with Alex

1719
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,928
Syria and the information

1720
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,744
Nothing is really all that different back

1721
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,280
Really it's weird

1722
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,816
The more you look at it the more

1723
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,096
It pretty similar it is

1724
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,376
Even though somebody

1725
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,168
External appearances a thing

1726
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Have change

1727
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
Quite a bit

1728
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,776
So the case of this information is actually really

1729
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,080
The caller is saying with the documents

1730
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,104
Come from a hack

1731
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:04,896
To explain.

1732
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,432
That they came from a hack

1733
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,224
A group called Brittany

1734
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,992
Defenses

1735
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:13,600
And it is apparently true that for

1736
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,904
So that you know there is

1737
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,184
Some real world

1738
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,792
Much of the information that was

1739
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,888
They ended up getting put

1740
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
However

1741
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Expert

1742
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,776
Studied or certain

1743
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:34,592
The document about a pending false-flag in Syria is

1744
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:38,176
Steak was fabricated specifically to be put in this league

1745
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,456
And we planted

1746
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
Yeah in fact

1747
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,552
Britton defenses

1748
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
For posting a story about the

1749
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,368
This document and one

1750
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:49,184
Winning a settlement of 110,000 lb

1751
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
For libel

1752
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:54,304
Interesting Lee Alex posted an article about this

1753
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,584
I wonder if that has no

1754
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,352
Something to do with it

1755
01:33:56,608 --> 01:34:00,192
Man the fact that this fake document was planted into a legitimate

1756
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,216
Malika haqq

1757
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,264
The question who it was

1758
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
To carry this out

1759
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,080
It doesn't seem like it would be

1760
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,384
Some random person or low-skilled

1761
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,200
Britain was Operation

1762
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,272
The only real motive for inserting the false

1763
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,320
Which is the one that was publicized

1764
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,368
Not using the other documents as

1765
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,928
Support

1766
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:24,256
It was this specifically fake

1767
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:29,376
Thick got all of the media pushed its what this caller is calling in to try and sell a crime

1768
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:32,192
The only motive is to make any chemical attacks

1769
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,032
Immediately be suspected as false flag

1770
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,848
And the only people who really have that kind of emoji

1771
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,640
Would be pro-assad entities

1772
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,176
The list

1773
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,456
Is pretty short

1774
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,760
So

1775
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:48,064
Extremely powerful

1776
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
Or at least

1777
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:53,184
Sarah Elizabeth

1778
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,584
Eating propaganda narrative

1779
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,376
Community

1780
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:07,776
Right

1781
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:13,920
Just nobody I can think of not a single person

1782
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:18,016
Putin frequently made arguments that chemical attacks list

1783
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,296
False

1784
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:23,392
Probably a coincidence coincidence that this happened

1785
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,696
After Putin

1786
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Again

1787
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,768
Coincidence

1788
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,144
I don't know it's one thing to

1789
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
To save it

1790
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,472
Good

1791
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,128
That's feels like Russia might have been

1792
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,552
Entirely possible that

1793
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,904
Wanted to f*** around

1794
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,464
Jump to that conclusion

1795
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,744
2

1796
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
History pattern

1797
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,072
But that doesn't prove anything

1798
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,888
It hasn't been

1799
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,936
Who necessarily was behind

1800
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,960
But

1801
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,240
Whatever the case is

1802
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,288
This caller probably Unknowing

1803
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,312
Is

1804
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:18,944
Alex is getting this call and I don't

1805
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
Respect

1806
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,600
It is actually

1807
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,280
This caller is

1808
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
Trying to

1809
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:36,864
Trick Outlet

1810
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
Facts about something

1811
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,752
Layers of b*******

1812
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,544
More interest

1813
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:48,128
Alex by Zeppelin hook line into here is Alex's respond

1814
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,176
Why don't you

1815
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,256
I understand that Alex look

1816
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
I'm sending it to you at Chouteau

1817
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
You look at it

1818
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
You be the judge

1819
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,448
I'm telling you

1820
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,032
Damning

1821
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:16,800
Right now

1822
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
God help

1823
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:21,664
Me I'm probably signing my own death

1824
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:22,944
Send it to

1825
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,736
Infowars.com

1826
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:37,024
Demonstrative that Alex doesn't believe the bulshit he sells on his show

1827
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,840
The way you so dismissive of this caller

1828
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:45,984
Howard

1829
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:51,872
What is this guy some sort of secret information that you could be killed for 278

1830
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:57,760
No Alex is far more careful with his sources

1831
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
Is Ben The Intern

1832
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,320
It's an insane

1833
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:02,112
Level of distrust

1834
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:02,880
If its own audio

1835
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,904
Which I think is healthy

1836
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,696
But it doesn't match how Alex

1837
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,072
I asked you this cuz I could go either way on this

1838
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
At this point

1839
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
Alex

1840
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,448
Know that he

1841
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,008
Has a show tip email

1842
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,544
Yeah okay

1843
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,640
Alex says okay

1844
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,664
Posted to YouTube

1845
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:32,064
He was just trying to be like yourself

1846
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,464
Why don't you get this ball rolling then I'll cover your feet

1847
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:44,096
Don't want to create more work for Paul

1848
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
What I thought was interesting

1849
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,704
Christine

1850
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
I heard that

1851
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:57,152
And Alex information to comes out of anonymous sources and

1852
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,224
I heard

1853
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:04,320
Immediately I don't know why

1854
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:06,880
He's going to f****** report this as

1855
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,160
There's a story

1856
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:14,816
Like I just knew I have a hunch I had to listen to the 28th because I was like

1857
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:20,704
Positive you can report this report

1858
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,264
I was certain it was going to be the next day

1859
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
Here's what happened

1860
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,592
Alex is literally

1861
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:03,456
Completely right

1862
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:09,856
But everything that surrounds that caveat is to get people to not think that's the case

1863
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:13,440
Paul Watson he knows a lot about this job he thinks it looks good

1864
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,280
He scanned over to check that if it's a hoax elaborate

1865
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:23,168
Which is super unlikely guys and you know what I think it's credible because it matches up with things that I've said

1866
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,448
In the past which is

1867
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,496
Support of Assad

1868
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,312
Man

1869
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,848
You just

1870
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,384
You got tricked

1871
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:36,992
He went to bed he woke up the next day and was like I'm f****** running with it

1872
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,064
Siberian his defense

1873
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,392
I don't I hate that but

1874
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,440
A lot of other people

1875
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,000
A lot of people got tricked

1876
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:54,400
You know I don't have a scorecard of how people responded this early and all I'm interested

1877
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,264
It's really a

1878
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
Nice

1879
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,056
For me

1880
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,592
To have my instant

1881
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,872
Clearly

1882
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,408
Vindicator

1883
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,992
Here we go

1884
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
Amanda

1885
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:16,928
Throws me a curveball by being like it's usually government sock puppets

1886
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,120
Good I got to say

1887
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:31,008
So sorry sorry dude

1888
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:34,848
Fabricated document is not good

1889
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,968
Because it is

1890
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,760
Dropped on its face

1891
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:42,784
Prettiest

1892
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,552
Yeah

1893
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,344
Part of it is

1894
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,112
Email

1895
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:50,464
About

1896
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,256
Basically

1897
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:01,984
So even if other people do get raped by it they wanted

1898
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,776
Alex

1899
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,200
It indicates that he looked at it was like we can work with this

1900
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
So

1901
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,016
Anyway

1902
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:19,136
The rest of the 28th is mostly Alex just nothing

1903
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:25,024
It's not worthless

1904
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:31,424
To Death By ignoring airbox

1905
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,984
Texas

1906
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,008
Velo

1907
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:38,848
It's it's pretty crazy episode

1908
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,920
I mean there are moments that are kind of

1909
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,272
Bordering on entertaining

1910
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,576
Stretching it out

1911
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
Bra sever

1912
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
It's just

1913
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:59,072
Such standards

1914
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,144
And we are through the 28th

1915
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,960
I hear and that's the

1916
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,776
I think I think there's massive

1917
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Progress

1918
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,080
Here in this

1919
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
This time span

1920
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:13,664
I also just like

1921
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,456
I look back at this episode

1922
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,832
No more episodes

1923
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,392
The experience of listening to all these episodes

1924
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,928
It's just a wallet

1925
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:25,952
Yeah

1926
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:28,000

01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,240
As up as a signpost

1932
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,032
Get people to stop taking their medication

1933
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,056
Isaac

1934
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:48,224

1935
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,016

1936
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:56,928
Trash Operation Paul Revere contest that ended

Sucks

1942
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:10,496
I disagree with you on one point

1943
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:14,336
What's up I really did find a cute when he in Jerome corsi

1944
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:20,736
Got into that little sitting there I was I would not

1945
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,784
But I don't agree with you

1946
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,552
Start something

1947
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:27,904
There's something to that

1948
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:34,304
You guys are having a great time Lex Luthor

Make a career out of tricking p

1952
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,408
They might combine

1953
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,176
There are ever

1954
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:56,576
The Legion of Doom from the 60s Justice League cartoon

1955
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,856
Yeah

1956
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,184
Wow there is acumen

1957
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,720
Lightning

1958
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:03,744
It's ugly

1959
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,768
All that is just

1960
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,304
Crashed

1961
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
If you look at that

1962
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:08,864
24th

1963
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,632
25th

1964
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,192
27th 28th what is that

1965
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:12,960
Like

1966
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:17,568
15 hours of

1967
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:19,104
It's worth it

1968
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,128
Because

1969
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,920
You scatter that trash

1970
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:26,528
Kika decide clean your room by Jordan Peterson

1971
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,064

01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,344
Is Alex

1973
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,136
Rationalizing

1974
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,160
And pivoting

1975
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
On the twenty

1976
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,512
And I think that is

1977
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:37,792
Crucially

1978
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
Important dates

1979
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,352

Cooper's nose

1983
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,520
Being to just

1984
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:49,568
You say things

1985
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,336
A fake

1986
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,616
Interactor

Enso

1988
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:57,504
That's going to be a real real fall off

1989
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,832
Really big

1990
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,368
Alex being a piece of s***

1991
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,160
