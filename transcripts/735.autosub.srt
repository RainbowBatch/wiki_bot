00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736

MoneyGram

Knowledge vype.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
At the altar of Celine

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Byway regrets

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Had a few what is your regrets today actually

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
On Wednesday

9
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,344
Sort of a tradition because we put a too much content

10
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,512
Bab instant reaction the pro pad I got a lot of messages about although there's going to be an emergency episode tonight

11
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,632
Well that was on Wednesday. Wednesday's Survivor

12
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
Happens Angela Lansbury

13
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008
Generally get together and watch Survivor also

14
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
We've not been able to this already like

15
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
Three episodes into emergency episode

16
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Simultaneously everyone's off between to it is a difficult

17
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,672
Situation so I watch Survivor

18
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,048
Pretty fun

19
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
But I also I went over and I got this enamel pin Angela Lansbury

20
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Kevin

21
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
From Up

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,336
The bird said you love Kevin from Up Hubbard

23
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432
Thing animated character of all time

24
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Lefou

25
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Makes up for how bad up is As a movie yeah I said it

26
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
The first five minutes and then forgets the rest of it I have some troubling feelings about that movie as a whole

27
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
First 5 minutes

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Was a problem

29
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
God passport

30
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
Stop the darkness of it

31
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
Popular opinions about whether or not

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
Their relationship was healthy

33
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
I didn't entire podcast about this years and years ago back in stand-up days I don't want to rehash it now

34
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
Has a stand on it

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,744
You can stand it up so it's going to be with me

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Forever

37
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,352
I appreciate it absolutely

38
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,216
My bright spot Dan is two albums got dropped to

39
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
On the same day

40
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,056
Very very good but whatever

41
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
Freddie Gibbs Freddie Gibbs

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,480
Killing it everybody's it for the past is last three albums are like he's the best route he's pretty great

43
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
And then the Yeah Yeah Yeahs came back on new album I know

44
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Sound like

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,976
Different band it sounds more like Karen owes more freezing

46
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,816
Is really good

47
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
I got to be honest with

48
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,496
What Yeah Yeah Yeahs are right in that spot where like I think I was in college when they were really

49
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Play Popular

50
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
I hated the people who are into quote College Rock and they got put in that box but I do know Maps

51
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
From Rock Band

52
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
This is not

53
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:11,392
We're all very excited for that maps from rock band that's how I discovered

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
They really interesting backstory

55
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
No no it would be damned

56
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
It's Punk scene from the with the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem and Yeah Yeah Yeahs all coming up the same time

57
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
Released their debut massive album on the same day

58
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,015
Blueprint

59
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
The blueprint

60
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
And it was also 911

61
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
The reason that I remember that specifically

62
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,935
Yeah I was actually I just as you were saying that I got really deep into my head about

63
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,567
Like how much stuff I discovered through Rock Band and honestly

64
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,895
My parents didn't like the Beatles because they were very druggy

65
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Until there wasn't there wasn't like

66
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
That influence in my childhood a ton of like older music as I

67
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
I was coming up

68
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
Write like a lot of energy got put into weird hip-hop and so like

69
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,631
Encyclopedic back

70
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:32,031
I don't I don't have that about classic rock stuff is kind of like

71
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,919
Blind-spot classic rock

72
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,991
Beatles Rock Band came out I didn't know

73
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
Most of those songs

74
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
And then yesterday

75
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,439
Is on there as a kind of this song

76
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,839
I am unpopular opinions about The Beatles

77
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
And how much I despise them

78
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Wow but what you going to do

79
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,799
Well let's not get into it now let's shoot another case

80
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,199
I heard the verdict came in on Wednesday and like I said people tried to get me to not watch Survivor with my friend

81
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,551
But I persisted and watching Survivor and here we are

82
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
We didn't want to do this on Mike

83
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
Because

84
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Run the risk of getting a bunch of

85
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,631
Champagne on my table but we have a bottle of champagne and that we are raising this is a Argyle

86
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Is the name of

87
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
Yeah and it's in Chicago in uptown restaurant

88
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
A lot of are alive or episodes recorded on Argyle not true Ainsley the street

89
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,111
Podcast

90
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,743
Answer yeah we're having a little champagne while we discuss this

91
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
Circle back to Our Roots Aw

92
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,655
I wish I could

93
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
I understand it and there was just one

94
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
I feel like

95
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
That wasn't the

96
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
First

97
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Wine and weed

98
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,175
No not the first one we drank was very cheap

99
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
So was boba

100
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
Yeah anyway

101
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,183
Yeah that is the day of the the announcement of the verdict is Right today

102
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
And so there's a couple things

103
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
That we're going to

104
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
Recovering

105
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
We'll have an episode 2 comes out this weekend it'll be a little bit of a special thing for folks course but then

106
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
And on Monday I hope to get into a little bit more even of the aftermath

107
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
But I decided

108
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
You do is we'll talk about Alex's

109
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Response to the verdict

110
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,247
A little bit of the war room and then Alex did a special show that evening

111
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
Answer will talk about

112
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,111
You're saying is thoroughness is the enemy of immediacy

113
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
That's what I'm hearing

114
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
Sometimes things need to marinate a little bit

115
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Tile work

116
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
So we're going to get into this talk about October 12th and the b******* that happens

My enemies

A list for me

138
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
And then we're going

139
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
To come back

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
And I'm going to

141
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Start the show over

142
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
F*** you

20 words for you but

145
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
At the end of the day

146
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
F*** you and your new world order

147
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
She rode in on

148
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
And all your s***

149
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Maybe today

150
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

151
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Got to hear tomorrow

152
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
And you never see me again

153
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
I never want to come

154
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Back here again

155
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Apologize

156
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Today that I

157
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Was legitimately having right now

158
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Better tomorrow

159
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,639
He may never have to come back here tomorrow at some point

160
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,479
To the door and I have another contacts drop for you to enjoy

161
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Is your awesome

162
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,975
We don't fart here we don't fart here

163
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
We don't fart here

164
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
If you want that s***

165
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
You go to onlyfans

166
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
I go to onlyfans for fart

167
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
Alex on onlyfans no.

168
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,871
There's an interesting aspect to this that like

169
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
Think Alex could fart and I have just the audience that he does because the things that he does aren't any more info

170
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,623
That's true that's true, largest stuck

171
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,695
It reminds me of

172
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
French

173
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
Man I believe was called Le Petit May

174
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
And he would fart

175
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,215
I bet he was really really good at it could make a bunch of different impressions of animals farting

176
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:26,079
He was famous for having an enema every morning

177
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Four Kings

178
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,991
My friend

179
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Alright

180
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
I want to start a life

181
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,671
So we all know why we're here today so I decided to

182
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:46,559
Blow past the first few hours of b******* and rambling about nukes on out to show to get down to the verdict

183
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Is red

184
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Literally

185
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Signed off

186
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
In the fourth hour of his show

187
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:59,615
That is break for commercials at 16 after the top of the hour you just leave

188
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
T-Rex

189
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
It all infowarsstore.com

190
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,231
That's 45 minutes then I would throw her like I sell tobacco

191
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
6 p.m. central

192
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Please

193
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Magnify the broad

194
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
You are the power

195
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
You're the reason we're successful

196
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Naturally Alex did not leave

197
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
The bump

198
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,127
Because after the commercial break

199
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,759
Alright was set to host or they just handed me a note

200
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
What is that

201
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
Will be about 2

202
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Minutes

203
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
That's from my lawyer Norm pattis

204
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Show trial

205
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
They are now having the

206
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Secretary of State

207
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
In Texas

208
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
Zoomy for Quest

209
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
The elections

210
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
Hell on them

211
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
That's an unfortunate reveal of Alex's true feelings I didn't question the Texas election because Republicans

212
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Duh

213
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,695
Sure sounds like someone is driven by concerns that are sincere about Alexa

214
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
Hey now that might be him revealing too much in an offhand comment that he didn't think anybody would

215
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
Pay attention to his above the left-right Paradigm and that's when you're above the Left Right paragraph

216
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,895
Show about this the Texas Secretary of State came out and made some comments about how severe the harassment that

217
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Alexa

218
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Kitchen workers

219
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Have been getting right

220
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
Right and Alex Jones is

221
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,063
You know definitely a part of that

222
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
That's that's not

223
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:52,255
I don't think I was even in a written article in the hill about it that wasn't even like

224
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,351
A part of like you should face consequences for this is that there is

225
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,447
This consequence for already we're already there

226
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
We've got the consequences.

227
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:07,871
Alex Goes to the verdict and I will send it to his credit

228
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
He is not under any pretense that this is going to go well

229
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Total made-up crap

230
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,063
We're a public official

231
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Who is

232
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
We watch lie to me

233
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
Weaver 550 billion dollars

234
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Warriors app for last week

235
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,063
Let's go to the audio of the bigger show trial in US history

236
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,415
Where the jury was supposed to go away then

237
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
See if we repelled them

238
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
Throw this one out there I think Norm well might as well

239
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
Being like I'm going to get down on my knees for a little while

240
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,847
I'm going to pray into this microphone

241
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Find the news is going to be bad at the same time I'm under no pretense that this is

242
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,807
No good news coming folks

243
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Let me ask you folks

244
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
You know how much I believe in God

245
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
Well I don't believe in him enough to think he's going to help me out here I am not going to get a miracle no so he has a predict

246
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,631
Fiction about this

247
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,055
I don't have any money so it's all Big Joe

248
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
There's Blumenthal son

249
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
The anti-gun Democrat

250
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Running

251
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,135
Got so this is a good way to experience at one of the

252
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,975
Lawyers is the son of Senator Blumenthal and so right

253
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
This is

254
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
All because of the app that makes

255
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,727
Perfect sense is a convincing thing that Alex is saying right now I find myself

256
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:15,359
I mean it's obviously this is 200 million is what he saying he think

257
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
Sure he does say that he had it all hands meeting

258
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,271
Like a couple days before

259
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,927
So I don't know if there was something about the judge's body language that talked him down from that billion prediction

260
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,303
To 200 million but as the the 900 million +

261
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
Verdict comes along as I always well it's nice to be an a******

262
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,823
It's also nice to just play fast and loose with prediction

263
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
If if

264
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
The only hashtag

265
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
For Alex Jones Is Right

266
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
Was him predicting he would lose a billion dollars

267
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
I would I would agree

268
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
I'll be like hashtag Alex Jones

269
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
To be fair I'm not sure there's any public version of him predicting that outside there

270
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,655
So I'll talk about what's going on in this courtroom and they're pretty troubling

271
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
Convert 2 mi

272
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
Everything

273
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Sorry when

274
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,439
Weird, cuz it away what he's suggesting is that he's some kind of an unwilling

275
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Christ figure for the media

276
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,327
By sacrificing him their purging their own sin and casting it onto a lie

277
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
And he doesn't want their send so this is just bizarre

278
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Yeah

279
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Yeah

280
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
I mean

281
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,383
Wait so Alex is hated the mainstream media for forever

282
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,711
For doing things that he insists that he never does

283
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
Right however the mainstream media has apparently chosen

284
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Him

285
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,623
As the avatar for all the bad things

286
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
They do that he does

287
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Sprite

288
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
Right so either many that he does

289
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
No no I don't think so

290
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:19,007
He is without saying that's why he must be the vessel for their sin

291
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
The real cry stories of an a******

292
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
I killed a cat

293
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
That well I mean he fought dragons he killed a kid he brought the kid back to life though whatever

294
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
Were the case

295
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,319
Does sincerely look at this as like

296
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
I am

297
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623

Call Jerry how guilty I was

305
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
Pausing to get the media time to call Darlin

306
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
The full effect

307
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,575
Try to get credibly the corporate system again which they'll never bring back

308
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
Is a dinosaur

309
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
Come on Christopher let's get it going

310
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,631
Really feel like he's getting impatient with the process and just being like what I'm doing

311
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
Yeah I'm tuning in for the verdict so I can do like some sort of the pageant about it and

312
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,407
There's Lowe's here in Brighton

313
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Right

314
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
And that that's kind of attention so what you should do in the trial where the

315
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,183
Point is you made a bunch of money off of hurting these people

316
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Is

317
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
Try and make a lot of money

Well that's pretty much what's going to be happening I mean here's a plug in the middle of waiting for the number

321
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Aesthetic

Absolutely

335
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
There is a weird thing where he saying like the judge is pausing in order to get the media to TuneIn for Maximum Impact

336
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Right people are tuning into him to see his reaction to the verdict

337
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:55,679
Like plugs in the law but the same game he's accusing

338
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,983
The court of doing I will give

339
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
The judge

340
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Perhaps

341
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,639
Some of the most credit that a a reactionary person as myself can give

342
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Which is that

343
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
She read

344
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Pages

345
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
Upon pages

346
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,647
Like 15 pages I don't know how many badges so quietly

347
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,256
Didn't say a word emotion she was reading out

348
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,560
A billion dollars and was like

349
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
A billion dollars you know what what you have to do to pass the the secondary bar that gets you to be a judge

350
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Just faceless have to wear one of those clear helmets with a scorpion

351
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
That's a good idea

352
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,624
Be able to keep a stiff upper lip

353
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
First page she read the first page

354
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
As an adult a human adult

355
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
And it said

356
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
120 million dollars

357
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
And she did not immediately go

358
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,752
You have a job position in an office

365
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,024
And fairly close to Accurate in terms of how

366
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
The projection

367
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,376
How the process could work out

368
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,032
Losing faith if they're going to read the verdict solenoid

374
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
It shows how

375
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
Tone-deaf

376
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
These people are but I want to report I said I would get to it I didn't

If there's a problem

383
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
If whether weapons are real

384
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Right

385
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
Honestly losing a billion dollars doesn't seem that important debate

386
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
I'd be like

387
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
They have weather weather

388
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
All is all bets are off

389
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,448
If Alex's s*** was real at all there's so many more important things to do than Amelia

390
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,032
Navel gazing your trial

391
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
Absolutely

392
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
I know it is what it is

393
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:48,992
What are you mad about millions of dollars with 90% of the population is going to be dead soon

394
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,648
Well yeah a nuclear war millions of people being killed by the covid vaccine whether weapons the whole thing

395
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Severe

396
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
But if so

397
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,536
He's having a good time so

398
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
He's having a great time he's very

399
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
I just bear with me

400
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032

No One Believes them

Everybody hates

405
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
Star systems over there in full panic

408
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:33,280
They're the bad guy knew I was walking into the lion's den I'm not surprised their Alliance

409
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:39,680
I got it and you know we talked about this a bit this Dynamic of Alex interpreting consequences and

410
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
Negative feedback

411
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
As virtue

412
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,568
Symbols of virtue

413
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,968
Basically a revealing of how virtuous yeah well understood

414
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
World this is

415
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Like

416
00:24:54,016 --> 00:25:00,160
How over the target Amaya billion dollars over the target 965

417
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
5 million good person units

418
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,280
That I was awarded

419
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
In this trial get money but I got good person units in

420
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Real

421
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
Actually believe that deep down

422
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,592
That is the Public Presentation of it so

423
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
When we get to the first

424
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,528
Account for the first plaintiff which is Robbie Parker write 20 million-dollar judgement

425
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
Alex

426
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:36,000
Definition

427
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
60 million-dollar

428
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,376
Emotional distress damages

429
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,936
60 million dollars

430
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Here's what I'll say

431
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Evicted me

432
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,488
And got a judgment of 120 million dollar

433
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
You know

434
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
I'm going to laugh

435
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
And Shout because

436
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
F******

437
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Go for it man

438
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,472
You can have all of my money and a hundred million dollars

439
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
We got

440
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Fine

441
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
You know what you're doing before is what I've got

442
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,992
Alex actually has 120 million dollars so that first judgment must have been like

443
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,184
I mean like if I'm sued for an even if I have 120 million dollars

444
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,768
If I'm in the judgment is being read

445
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:46,656
Am I also have other cases that are still pending that's not. Probably not going to laugh at that judgment

446
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Right

447
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:53,312
Little bad in terms of like going to play this through the courts with a

448
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,896
Billion dollar judgment

449
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
You're right

450
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,832
It probably leads one to believe that these these puppies cannot be high enough

451
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
Terms of getting him right he's kind of experiencing a moment

452
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Like a like

453
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,352
How it looked in the nuclear bombs

454
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,168
Like it weighs 8 was that kind of like he's

455
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,520
Slim Pickens on the nuclear bomb just riding

456
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
Slim Pickens dies immediately after that he doesn't have to think go to court that's why it's art

457
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,832
I mean it's like a child who gets sent a timeout need to go sit in the bathroom and then they break things in the background

458
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:42,976
SoundCloud

459
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
Sorry I mean basically all you can do is cheat

460
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Francine wheeler

461

Acquainted Francine wheeler

Total Fitness

466
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,536
Nothing really more insightful than that yeah and a

467
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,400
I think you should try to put a brave Face Forward

468
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,544
And again play into that like this means I'm so right right that afraid of me

469
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
I find it a little bit boring

470
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
Xbox

471
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
I mean I can't I can't imagine my response

472
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
Because that's

473
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
And upstairs

474
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:44,160
Like I would have to go through to get to the point where you would be experiencing this respond

475
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:49,280
In the moment

476
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
I think just

477
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,912
I wouldn't be surprised really hearing those words

478
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:01,312
Come off as unreal to have like a surreal moment for me like the moment the

479
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
First moment they said

480
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
60 million dollars

481
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
I lost my s*** ghetto like I was like I can't believe that this pretty surprised it was and I

482
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
Imagine for Alex it has to have been like

483
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:20,000
Well this is clearly pretended I'm dreaming you know cuz he's very little attached to reality in the first place

484
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Sure sure

485
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
Is there any movie about

486
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
Has predictive programming for him

487
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
I'll tell you this

488
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
Not f****** yet

489
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
No there will be

490
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,640
Fingers crossed one day you get to make that movie Jordan in the casting will be weird

491
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,224
So yeah I mean the news a bunch of Celebration they like

492
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
It just feels like a game to him honestly

493
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,376
Emotional

494
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
43 Nolan

495
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,360
So close

496
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
81600000

497
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
Not good

498
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,880
GE keep saying like it up yeah

499
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
At a certain point it's like

500
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:28,096
You're going to you're going to have all this above you might as well like make a comical

501
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
Or like

502
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,192
This is your team in the Super Bowl

503
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,496
Right and you're down 21-3

504
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,080
And the other team is at the 10-yard line and you're just like

505
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,664
Yeah man run up the score I want to lose by 100

506
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,064
F****** great man I didn't like this football game anyways I want to set record totally

507
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,464
If we're going to lose we should lose by the most there's ever been in the Super Bowl

508
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,816
Just proves how right you are about football

509
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:03,168
Oh yeah and along the way there's not a whole lot of content but

510
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,008
He does takes a couple Avenues to introduce some like I don't know

511
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
80 trans commentary

512
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,360
18600000

513
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
So let's just what a show trial looks like

514
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
The left completely out of control

515
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
This is this is there

516
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
They're Panacea

517
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
57600000

518
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
7 million

519
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Nice Oprah there

520
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
Reference to Oprah that was your friend Oprah Winfrey

521
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
Look I mean there's not a lot going on here outside of this

522
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,088
Totally

523
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,928
You can watch the video and see his facial expressions and what have you but like

524
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:03,328
It's just a bunch of played my way

525
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
Slowly like

526
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
A little bit underneath the verdict perfect

527
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Immediately like

528
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,616
Interspersed with the verdict being read like

529
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,968
60 million dollars

530
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
Somatic

531
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,576
Artistic

532
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:30,976
Purpose there this is just kind of boring and I think Alex even gets bored of listening to

533
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Today's numbers

534
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:38,656
Plaintiff here about the billions and billions and billions

535
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
Was put up Drudge Report right now for

536
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
Billion dollars

537
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
Personally don't have two million dollars

538
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
The company's almost completely out of money

539
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
These are two appeal take gears

540
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,760
Scabs almost all of us

541
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
This is just

542
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Completely

543
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Lemay.

544
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,928
Party run

545
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,512
Drudge Report

546
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,584
I want to scare everybody away

547
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Freedom

548
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,936
Scare us away from questioning Uvalde

549
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
Other event

550
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
Guess what we're not

551
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
Amber not going away

552
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
Literally

553
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
For hundreds of thousands of dollars

554
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
Keep them in court for years

555
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Appeal this stuff

556
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,064
We can stand up against this travesty

557
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
Against the billions of dollars they want

558
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
It's a joke

559
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
Please go for store.com

560
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
He's decided that the Drudge Report is bad now again

561
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
Hero who received an

562
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,520
Unfair Kangaroo Court billion-dollar judgment is now

563
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,152
Easy shifting alliances are are hard to keep track of when the devil's involved

564
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:59,552
Tower it takes a while for these verdict to be read and so Alex

565
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:05,440
Room starts riding shotgun with a ballroom stay in the chair

566
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
Nah I want takes over

567
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:12,352
Boo I will say no and tries to

568
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
Put on a brave face hear it

569
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
All you liberals

570
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Volume

571
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Call you Eva

572
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Pedophiles

573
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Hoping that you're going to be

574
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
In our depression

575
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
No

576
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
We never felt better Act

577
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
The biggest Victor

578
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Three of all time

579
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
You couldn't

580
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Confirm that

581
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Everything we've

582
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Women fighting for is

583
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Real

584
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Are you doing for and everything or fighting

585
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Israel

586
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
You've only

587
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Solidified

588
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
The truth

589
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
This seems convincing

590
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
Oh man

591
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,176
Man if everybody was celebrating my downfall the last thing I would do was get up on

592
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,712
A public place and be like

593
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,480
I'm not

594
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:06,880
Down falling

595
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:13,280
Billion dollar company that is the only people who would ever employ me in any meeting

596
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
Capacity is not a problem for me

597
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,472
On the screen

598
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
The years I worked for it

599
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
Whatever I could be like someone frankly with Owen just demonstrate basic Excel skills

600
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,904
That'll go a longer way than anything else he does right now

601
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,304
So what events does not juggling not Excel not plate-spinning

602
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Norcos on

603
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,824
How does Batman live on the day-to-day when he wakes up and looks at his dumb ponytail in the

604
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Mirror every morning

605
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
What does he think

606
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,224
You don't ever see Matt Faithfully video by Journey

607
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,624
So the music video the road is no place to stop

608
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,744
There's a shot in it always sticks out in my mind and Steve Perry has a mustache

609
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,144
And there's a shot of him very soulfully shaving his mustache looking in the mirror and

610
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:30,336
After a beating like Norm had in court I just picture him like looking in a mirror and just soulfully cutting

611
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:36,736
We have to take me to Rebrand feel like there's some

612
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:41,856
Sort of warrior code where if you lose that men not saying that there's any kind of

613
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
But it's just

614
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,184
You know you cut your ponytail off if you lose that

615
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
I will say to Norm's credit and one of the few times I'll say that

616
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
Owen is trying to do this like

617
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,680
We're actually ever been at least as the perspective of like

618
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Good

619
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
There's a lot of things we can do

620
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
But that was bad

621
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
That was about as bad as it could go

622
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:11,040
Yeah actually is message that he brings to Owen

623
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
Presenting Alex Jones

624
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Casey was in

625
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
In the courtroom there

626
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
He has

627
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Joined us

628
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
The phone now

629
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Respond to this

630
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
1

631
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
Billion dollars

632
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
Norm it's time to

633
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
Jack's

634
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Yeah well let me

635

Always prettiest

636
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
And what's more

637
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
Just the beginning

638
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
Belbien attorneys fees

639
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Increase this by

640
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
The ability to

641
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Damages

642
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:03,008
This is bad let me dumbass or you mad I could not be happier with norms

643
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,592
What blanket on Owens b******* Brave face

644
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
End up with 1 billion hits

645
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,184
I do appreciate that Norm really really feels

646
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
Like in the moment

647
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
That

648
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
This is a problem

649
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,376
That is worth two and a half billion

650
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
He really feels it

651
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Nintendo chilling message

652
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
That little thing

653
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
It's it's to Alex

654
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,616
No. Other people who want to have free speech

655
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,968
Alex has been just crowing constantly about how like this

656
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,296
He's going to appeal in a auger going to fight this forever

657
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:52,416
Norm is his lawyer and Norm in this clip says he doesn't know if Alex is going to appear

658
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
Huge verdict

659
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Chile message

660
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
The message that it's

661
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
If you're challenging your

662
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
India

663
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Determined

664
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
There's now a body of

665
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
If the stands on

666
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
An appeal

667
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Did you respond

668
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Anybody

669
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
You better.

670
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
That's not the message at all

671
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,976
If Alex takes the appeal Alex's fundraising for the appeal

672
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
Incessantly already

673
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
So that doesn't

674
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Feel-Rite know

675
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
You should be saying we're already at work on the appeal mean

676
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,520
He should be saying that Alex is fundraising to avoid having to deal

677
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
I mean

678
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Here's the problem with an appeal

679
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,432
Okay is it appeal unlike at this current trial

680
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:51,552
They can't bring in the evidence that you know there was already a $50 judgment

681
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,624
At no point in time in the trial could they be like

682
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
Hey Jerry

683
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,256
Just so you know we've run this game before and Alex lost

684
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
You know

685
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,120
In an appeals court you can be like hey guess what

686
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
4

687
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,448
Separate juries

688
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,104
Awarded billions of dollars the question becomes like is there a procedural problem

689
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
I'm with this k

690
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Sure

691
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,456
That would be what you would be appealing on

692
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
And if Norm

693
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,112
As the lawyer like you would know what the grounds for the appeal are

694
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:31,488
Probably be involved in it at Alex's lawyer well he would be the reason that it's

695
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,048
That's interesting

696
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
Hey this one's on me

697
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Mistrial in history

698
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,408
This feeling's of the sentiment that consequences are a sign of virtue right it's just

699
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,248
Everywhere everywhere

700
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,296
Very deeply entrenched in the

701
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
I think that

702
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
Most people would say

703
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
Then America is

704
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
Is corrupt

705
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
This country has a corrupt

706
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Politically

707
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
And so then you would met

708
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
The state menu table how do you know who's

709
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Corruption

710
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
Once again the name is

711
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
Institution the news organization is

712
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
Infowars

713
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
I don't know if you can get into

714
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Future as far as

715
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Appealing this

716
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Or whatever cuz I know the audience

717
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
She's going to want to know

718
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,832
Future might hold

719
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
As far as appeals are

720
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Concern

721
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
Put it into a real world

722
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Computer

723
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
Let's say that

724
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
In

725
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
December of

726
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
2020

727
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
You go on air

728
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
And you question

729
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
The app

730
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Efficacy of the

731
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
The covid vaccine

732
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
Well now you're getting sued by the

733
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Companies that made the

734
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,616
But here we are a year later and now they're admitting

735
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Vaccine

736
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,919
Not safe or affect

737
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
They're trying to silence

738
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
They believe to be true

739
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
Ultimately be the truth

740
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
They don't want it out the

741
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,927
So no one's getting sued for that

742
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:10,559
Here's a shortlist of claims that might be actionable go against Alex

743
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:15,423
Four family members of people who lost people to covid who didn't

744
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,727
Do anything because Alex said it was safe

745
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
Remember when you said it was

746
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
I was a race specific bioweapon

747
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
I mean it seems like something that might be weird already said it was only killing males that was a that was a little thing

748
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,831
David Icke on a David Icke said viruses aren't even Island that's true

749
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
You only accept them into your body

750
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,631
Just said is we're grateful that the vaccine itself does not have grounds to Sue or a conscious

751
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Elizabeth

752
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
It would

753
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,823
Well no I think Osiris with OLX the virus owes Alex a lot

754
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
I think that owns example that is using there is because Alex would never have been sued if all he was doing was

755
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
Was questioned in a shooting

756
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,367
Yes come up with these fake argument because the underlying points that he's trying to make those aren't true

757
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
I mean

758
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:12,511
Easy entire show is evidence for why this is different

759
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,607
Like he does all the stuff that he says he's like

760
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
And no one has a problem

761
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,239
It's this what he's getting sued for

762
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,775
How is that not

763
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,311
Consistently pointed out

764
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
It seems relevant

765
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
Also this brute is not very good

766
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,455
Are you sure this isn't like a giant champagne

767
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,271
Bottle shaped

768
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,927
I think of cologne L man you are I'm going to tell you this right now the Willamette Valley

769
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:45,023
Is not going to be happy with your reviews

770
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,863
Adventures Isle of Oregon I'm going to tell you something with him at

771
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,263
So Norm like I said I think some of his perspective is maybe a little bit more forgivable or at least more power

772
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,663
Audible some of the other folks in there that is being like

773
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
If I hadn't shown up

774
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
I wouldn't

775
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
It maybe you'd be better off

776
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
I think that's

777
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
That's what they used to do today

778
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Call Amy Goodwin

779
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Things to argue

780
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
I had to move mountains

781
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
The wind right

782
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
Make the Limited

783
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
I was permitted to make

784
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
The bottom line is

785
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
I stayed home

786
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,575
It's debatable like he might have been better off

787
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,159
Is there a mention of any other lawyer who didn't say

788
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
Hey maybe these people are exaggerating their grief may be a different different lawyer

789
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
Maybe would have done better

790
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:57,983
I think I think Norms exclusion from this case might have been advantageous to LA

791
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Will die

792
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,543
Believing

793
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
That is

794
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,871
They had not presented any defense

795
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,431
If they'd just been like listen

796
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,503
We do not have any defense for our actions

797
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:16,159
The Judgment would not be a billion dollars I would say so I think that they made things worse for themselves

798
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,815
If if there was just sort of like a opening statement and closing statement about like the philosophical idea

799
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:29,215
This is what this is our belief

800
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
No questioning Noah

801
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
IAAI

802
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
Think they would

803
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:39,199
Definitely come out looking better and the way things went

804
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,783
Well what is your apology if your apology isn't

805
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
In the opening statement

806
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
And the closing state

807
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:49,183
It doesn't work to your advantage

808
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:53,023
Do you have Alex yell about how this is a struggle session real problem

809
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
That's a real problem

810
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,351
Yeah yeah

811
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
Easy pretty chill about this

812
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
I'm sure you now

813
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Alex Jones

814
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Probably side

815
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
And that you never

816
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
Oh yeah I mean

817
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
Getting phone calls

818
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Text messages

819
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,039
Maligning my lawyer ringing

820
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
Keytruda case

821
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
But I'm in Campo

822
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,999
Believe all three

823
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
It hurts I don't like

824
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Paola

825
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Headsets

826
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,471
Haters are going to hate

827
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,775
Haters are going to hate haters going to hate

828
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
Haters are going to hate

829
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,127
That is that is the voice of a man

830
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,199
Who is going to get paid despite having lost

831
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,599
A billion plus a billion dollar case it is what it is

832
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
Are still billable

833
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
Haters Gonna Hate Hey listen Alex sorry about that

834
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
Play Shake It Off

835
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,887
Shake It Off lyrics

836
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
You know what the most important lesson for a lot of people

837
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
When did take the

838
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
And Norm knows

839
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
This is Adele

840
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,223
Maybe you pretend that you could have one or something nope but don't fight it too hard

841
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,063
If I had if I had had my druthers

842
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
We could have one

843
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,135
Anything right

844
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:29,535
Right right then maybe but as it is turns out that lying is not okay in court

845
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
Haters going to hate

846
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,143
Sonoran believes there's a question that no one asks about Infowars

847
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,703
This is the essential question

848
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
The question that nobody asked

849
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Must be an answer

850
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
What makes

851
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,663
Alex and Infowars

852
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
You don't

853
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
Drug that is

854
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Foreign to their body

855
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Obvious

856
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
And I'm kill

857
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Began under

858
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Understand what makes

859
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,767
Infowars

860
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
Ocular

861
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
Can the wrong

862
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,263
I agree with Norm that this is a factor that's underappreciated in terms of understanding Infowars and misinformation in general

863
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
His conclusion is childish

864
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
No one actually gravitates to Infowars or Alex because of his handle on information or the idea that you talked about stories

865
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,503
No one else has the nerve to cover

866
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:27,903
And I would say he's a drug that he hopes his listeners on even ignoring the dump lisabo a supplement that he sells it he

867
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
Markups

868
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,743
If he sells to People by pretending they have a deficient

869
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
Fancy that he can solve

870
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,583
Like you don't have iodine in uz need it

871
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,887
Alex creates emotional hooks

872
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:41,471
The get into people and they operate very similarly to how a drug

873
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,383
The truth or falsity of things Alex says don't matter to the audience because he's a listening of feeling that they believe is true

874
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:55,039
Some story about an immigrant murder in a white woman that Alex yells about may not actually be true but the audio

875
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
Doesn't care because to them

876
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:01,951
The feeling he's promoting with that story that you should be afraid of immigrants in that they want to kill white women

877
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
Is true

878
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,303
That's the majority of what Alex has gotten his skill saw

879
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Evoking

880
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Feelings

881
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:13,471
It's pretty easy to see why his show is successful well Owen and Harrison are just pathetic also-ran

882
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,031
They can't stir emotions like Alec

883
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
Text Cam

884
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:23,199
Owens just doing a bad Alex impression most of the time it doesn't come off as sincere at all and Harrison's just too clearly

885
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
A whiny baby dweeb

886
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,295
They can get a little bit of traction but they

887
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,903
They can't come anywhere near to even being like Alex's second because they can't do this

888
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:37,535
That's why pjw sucks on Alex's show but he's really successful on YouTube

889
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:43,935
In that format with the Quick Cuts in the weird close-ups on his face looking very emotional able to make the AR

890
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Fuel thing

891
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
Even David night at a bit of this

892
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,847
Which is why I was so dumb for Alex to fire him

893
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
Do you or I David night was a painfully boring snooze but his rhetorical style was good at reaching the older demographic

894
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,599
Who really don't care for Alex's Pediatric

895
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:06,463
He could elicit feelings in the older a supplementary for the people that Alex

896
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Can't hit exactly

897
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:12,607
No one goes to Infowars because they want information or hard-hitting reporting

898
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,239
That's the LIE they tell themselves so they don't have to admit that they're going to Alex for a hit of emotion

899
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,055
They crave for some reason or another

900
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Usually two

901
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,175
Justify unjustifiable positions that they have like racism or homophobia

902
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:31,551
They canceled their able to intellectualize those feelings by Alex appealing to those those feel

903
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:37,951
No and we we all instinctively know this not Lisa what like if you want to get into brain chemistry

904
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:44,607
The feeling you get from being right over and over again during a broadcast

905
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
Do you know like

906
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,911
Alex so off

907
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,239
Didn't consistently massaging your ego you know

908
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,311
How different from that is getting high for 3 hours

909
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:59,711
Save the World by giving him money

910
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,831
Jerk my ego offer I get high like it's very similar kind of things you know

911
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
Yeah not too dissimilar

912
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:10,463
The old wants to sue people now too because like

913
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,303
Popular

914
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,095
Yeah it so people call him a racist

915
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,679
And so he wants to see Norm has an interesting response

916
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
You know it's funny hearing you say all that

917
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
You know I'm banned from pretty much all big

918
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
Can take an Uber

919
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
Can't take an Airbnb

920
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
People call me a racist all the time

921
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,407
Contractions all these lies about me

922
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,223
24 billion dollars Norm

923
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
You can try

924
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Just got to find

925
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Yeah you can try

926
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:44,255
That's probably not the response that you want to hear from the lawyer I go for it

927
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,839
Because you never win tonight

928
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
In private

929
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,167
That's the response that you want to hear from a lawyer

930
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,471
On your show you want to hear

931
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,871
Hell yeah we can all Sue tomorrow

932
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:12,671
Walked off the stage after bobbing for an hour I would be very difficult to talk to go here

933
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:18,815
For like a half hour so you came offstage to a bill of a billion dollars from the bar

934
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,911
You drank the wrong bottle that is not

935
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,495
Far enough relatively speaking from a lot of my life

936
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:31,871
In my world at the time I bill my bar bill was about a billion dollars

937
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:35,455
The interview is not very interesting past

938
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
Pastor insight you're getting good sort of a lot of the same like we're going to appeal take two years

939
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,671
Spray blah blah give Alex money

940
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Yeah

941
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
So the War Room

942
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,375
The rest of it's just going to be a knowing and I don't care later in the evening

943
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,655
Alex comes back

944
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,983
He does his evening emergency broadcast

945
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,031
This point he's got himself a clip

946
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
Of Chris Maddie

947
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,175
On the on the steps of the courthouse afterwards with the family's behind him

948
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Giving press conference

949
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,527
And Alex

950
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,159
Plays that this is this is sort of

951
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,463
Got our finance

952
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
Give him money

953
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
Obviously

954
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
Red party

955
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
King daddy

956
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Uhaul.com

957
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
Listen to your

958
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Change it.

959
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Support

960
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
As long as it take

961
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
If you're out there right now

962
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
When you're 10.

963
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Audience member

964
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,479
The only

965
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Today

966
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
Thanks for your rig Court

967
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,047
Two things stick out to me here

968
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:32,447
The first is that this notion that Maddie would have a plan to discourage Alex's listeners from donating so Alex

969
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,519
Have enough money to appeal the cases to purchase on it

970
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:42,175
Is this case what I was as much of a railroading is Alex insists it is he should have no problem finding someone to

971
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
To defend him pro bono

972
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:50,111
Good buddy who clearly feels this cases of threat to the future of the world media star Bobby Barn

973
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:55,231
Barnes any of this were true that this case impinge Don

974
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,023
Fundamental constitutional rights

975
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:03,423
The ACLU would be all over defending our child printable goddamn Nazis over the years

976
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,799
Alex is not worse than them this was a principal matter they sell you couldn't

977
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
You couldn't stop them from

978
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:16,223
Begging we can't wait to show off how ACLU we are

979
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:21,855
The second thing is that tone at the end there were Alex's saying this isn't going to stop is probably unwise

980
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:28,255
There's still the Posner case to go you may remember himself fly a little too freely it feels like

981
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
That could haunt him

982
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,095
Particularly because that case is one where he is

983
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Super guilt

984
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,447
Could end up being way higher than the Lewis S11

985
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:43,359
Alex is trapped in a space between being essentially impotent to change reality and a defiant to the audience

986
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Or risk the cash drying up

987
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,455
If what Norm says means anything

988
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:52,319
Sure to be a while before this appeal is decided and ends up losing that

989
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,111
Unlikely ends up being

990
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,183
Thanks for the time for abuse of the appeals process along the way

991
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
But if the audience loses heart

992
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
That's a bigger Danger

993
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:07,423
I went over to save Infowars the other fundraiser they had to see where things he was about

994
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,239
Thousand dollars on the afternoon of the 30

995
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:16,383
Haha the day after the verdict came at 2 that evening of the 12th okay

996
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,199
He can muster

997
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:25,855
I went all out on his show on the war room and then here we have Alex doing an emergency

998
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,439
Guess that retroactively became part of a marathon that became

999
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,023
It started at 8 a.m. that day and then went till midnight

1000
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,607
Owen spent like three hours taking calls after Alex left

1001
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:40,191
In the first episode of Alex's long-awaited all colors show

1002
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,007
Actually still isn't the thing it was just feeling timeshare

1003
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,287
They pulled out all the stops

1004
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:48,383
And also this is Vitaly after Alex's show on the 13th

1005
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
And this is where they got to

1006
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:56,575
It's a respectable number for sure but it's not going to do s*** for him in terms of staving off bankruptcy or paying lawyer

1007
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,367
There's enough to fight this two-year appeal process

1008
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:03,743
Seems like a free market is saying that the demand for Alex's show just doesn't justify its exist

1009
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Anymore

1010
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Amtrak

1011
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,071
Like I said

1012
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
This is never going to stop thing is

1013
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,887
Making the

1014
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,703
Lawyers the plaintiff lawyers case for

1015
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,543
Okay so one million is 1

1016
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
Percent of a bill

1017
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,151
Am I right in saying that

1018
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
It's a thousand million

1019
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,479
Wright's Auto

1020
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,527
Is 1.1

1021
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
So that would be

1022
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
0

1023
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
2%

1024
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:37,279
Of the total amount needed to pay that off yeah but that notion is I need

1025
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:43,679
Enough money to pay the lawyers to make the business of pure profitable ship Bankruptcy Court

1026
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
And then it'll be smooth sailing

1027
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:50,079
So maybe $200,000 a Piers to be close to enough

1028
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,127
Of a supplemental money

1029
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
It's a

1030
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
It seems like

1031
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:02,367
Not enough if he gets a billion in Bitcoin it will really narrow down the number of people who could be

1032
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:06,463
That's true you know like a lot shorter

1033
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,863
Bissell barely wide range in America now but but I think I think Logistics put aside

1034
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:20,287
In fact they could do this like really go all out have a billion-dollar judgment against the company

1035
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,103
Muster out of the audience

1036
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,383
It's not good

1037
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
I mean like

1038
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
Just sort of

1039
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,503
Sending buttons to people for free

1040
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:33,599
Bright and if people want to donate to charity

1041
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:39,999
Like what $35,000 Plus for it

1042
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:46,655
It's a 200 Granda we also don't have a billion-dollar judgment against us and we're not begging

1043
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:53,055
People to donate to that's a big part of our overhead keeping it low

1044
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,591
Like $200,000

1045
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,663
In Alex music like with his circumstances

1046
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:03,039
I just think it's a bad Omen of what he can muster out of the audio

1047
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,599
Yeah they should be should be over a million

1048
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,391
Yeah I would think

1049
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,415
Based on

1050
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
Actually

1051
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,255
The fundraiser the goal is five hundred

1052
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:17,631
Right so mad and recycle they should have hit it they grow

1053
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
If anything about Alex

1054
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,519
His reach is audiences commitment any of that

1055
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
We're

1056
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:30,687
Like meaningful I find that to be a real real l

1057
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
If we actually had

1058
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,295
10% of the world listening to knowledge fight

1059
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,623
We would be able to drive more than 200

1060
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,927
I was going to say that

1061
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Oh no

1062
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,999
A real lack of Engagement commitment

1063
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,839
Alex is at Tom's people offer them jobs

1064
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
But he doesn't give a s***

1065
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,167
Hate to take one of the

1066
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:57,055
Play clamps Capers good landscaper

1067
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,127
He was I can take those cuz he'll be fired from them immediately

1068
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,199
But he he reached out

1069
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:07,807
Tried to find somebody big to have on for his marathon of course he's got Steve Quayle

1070
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,367
Guy who believes in write Biblical giant

1071
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
Right

1072
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
Organization

1073
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,999
Put us on are anywhere you're not shutting

1074
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Crackdown

1075
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
In Defiance

1076
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,911
Steve Quayle when the icons

1077
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
Liberty Movement

1078
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
Totally dedicated world

1079
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
Not the oven

1080
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,799
Nuclear war all of us here

1081
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:34,175
Everybody's been Vindicated and of course that means I don't know if you saw down

1082
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
Where was this

1083
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,039
I think this is over by Navy Pier, there were a bunch of giant

1084
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
Oh s*** yeah

1085
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,391
Oh my God the last time so here's the problem

1086
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:49,023
Like we've I've lived in uptown 45 years when I moved into uptown

1087
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:55,423
Unfortunately it appears that I was gentrification but I wasn't anywhere near as bad as the Giants

1088
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
2 moved into the past

1089
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
I mean they're nice

1090
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:04,639
But they take up a lot of room in ruins the lakefront

1091
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,967
View Skyline

1092
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:14,623
Just talked about the b******* about how World War 3 is here

1093
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,439
That World War 3 is here

1094
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
According to them

1095
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,255
The international Banker is in global

1096
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,327
Play Store afraid because Putin went to the gold standard

1097
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,655
Meanwhile just wanted people to respect

1098
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
His borders that was his whole thing

1099
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:32,031
Like you went to the gold standard and everybody else

1100
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:37,663
So mad at the problem

1101
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:43,039
Well that's probably just announced that they would buy goals from domestic institutions for a stable fix

1102
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,391
Price from March 28th to June 30th 2022

1103
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,791
They didn't anchor the rubles value to gold which is what Steve is saying that they did in order to justify this can be

1104
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,607
That the globalist want to start World War 3 over

1105
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
Right

1106
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,471
Russian made this move because they had a giant domestic gold Supply

1107
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:08,127
The craps vetement plant in Siberia is one of the biggest in the world and after they invaded Ukraine these them

1108
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,199
Plastic gold producers were barred from selling to International Market

1109
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,551
That would be really bad for a lot of folks with a lot of money and valuable commodity

1110
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:22,207
Putin announced that the Russian government in the central bank would buy their gold at a set price to offset

1111
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,767
The setbacks that were caused by invading Ukraine

1112
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,071
The way the United States does for like cheese

1113
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:32,447
Yeah this was set to start on March 28th and the price was cited 5,000 rubles per ounce

1114
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:38,847
However that announcement made the price of the ruble jump about 20% and on April 7th Russia decide to go

1115
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,943
Back on there. Spent it begin buying gold quote at a negotiated price

1116
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
Berry Rush of them

1117
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,623
The rebels have gained in value so they were getting screwed on the set gold price they decided to end it months before the program was set to run

1118
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:57,279
So just to clarify stiva saying that the globalist want to start World War 3 over the fact that Russia put their currency on a gold

1119
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,095
Standard but in reality the ruble isn't on the gold standard

1120
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
Spanish Fork turn buying of gold is that price

1121
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:06,751
Was just done to offset some of the market inconveniences that came after invading Ukraine

1122
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,823
You could say that Steve is on here just spouting

1123
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,687
Complete b******* in order to spread pro-russia messages and talking point but

1124
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
And this is not

1125
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,015
Protrude

1126
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,295
I stand corrected

1127
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,623
I got you so that's that's a large portion of

1128
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:29,279
What they end up talking about super interested in it

1129
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:34,399
Weird stuff ends up happening I kind of enjoy

1130
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Alex

1131
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,215
One of his big

1132
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
Dwayne

1133
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,799
Did this is profitable is

1134
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:43,103
There is a very severe thing that's happening

1135
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,407
But there's a chance we can stop it

1136
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,199
That's the gate there needs to be

1137
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:50,015
Denise me that window the maybe we can get out of

1138
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:56,415
It's going to be expensive tragedy we cannot stop however if you donate to us we can stop it there's a chair

1139
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:00,767
Exactly so he asks Steve If This World War 3 can be stopped

1140
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,327
Do anything the silencer

1141
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,351
The true silencer

1142
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
Even

1143
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
2 Pro

1144
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Vokey

1145
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,215
World War 3 in this is

1146
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
Big issue

1147
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
Tonight Alex

1148
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,543
We're on together

1149
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,591
It's not something they don't

1150
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
It's not something babe

1151
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,663
I fear they want

1152
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,687
With all

1153
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
Out there

1154
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,223
Globalist

1155
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,759
Luciferian Mike

1156
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,551
Because at the end of the day

1157
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
You've talked about not your videos

1158
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:26,879
Population

1159
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
Depopulate

1160
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Quads

1161
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Clams how's it going

1162
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
How to do it we watch

1163
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Millions

1164
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
Probably more

1165
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
Like at least

1166
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
I'd say

1167
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
50 million

1168
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,143
Why would you believe

1169
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,703
People have never familiar

1170
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,007
Can we stop it or is it biblical as I'm stopping

1171
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
It cannot be stopped

1172
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
It cannot be

1173
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Canopy

1174
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
These are the days

1175
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
That obvious

1176
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,247
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

1177
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,623
My house

1178
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
Interchangeable

1179
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
They used

1180
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,255
Conquer the f*** down then right I believe me

1181
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,327
How do you say that and not also be like

1182
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Hug your loved

1183
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
No like

1184
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,167
You're saying to me

1185
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:16,031
Global thermonuclear war is inevitable beyond that

1186
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
Horsemen of the Apocalypse

1187
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,639
Explain to me why I go to work today

1188
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:27,295
Unless your job is digging the hole for your family too high didn't know why you would

1189
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,367
Well then let's go dig a hole for my tablet

1190
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:36,767
Inconceivably it's go to the bunkers right I mean like that's the only

1191
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
X I mean okay

1192
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,863
So here's I feel like the game that is

1193
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,935
Happening there is he's playing a game of chicken with

1194
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
Where is like okay

1195
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Go to work

1196
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
Have some time

1197
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,639
Go out to eat dinner all the time but

1198
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,407
It's coming

1199
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,431
So you got to guess

1200
01:05:54,687 --> 01:06:00,831
Well I will say that I think it's Steve said s*** like this before and it has really hurt his career so I think he's probably

1201
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:07,231
He's probably a little bit jaded to consequences

1202
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
I might feel like he he suffered cons

1203
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,071
Brighten on

1204
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:17,471
Also Steve is like an end times guy like he's on Jim Bakker Show a bit looking at one of the few people

1205
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:22,847
The show that has like cross over to Baker

1206
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:28,991
Always Unstoppable is always happening we're already in the first of the

1207
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,271
The circles and

1208
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,575
Yeah like I said

1209
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
Checks up something happy

1210
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
Have they talked about Jesus a little

1211
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
Now you know I love it

1212
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,487
Steve

1213
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,071
Has an interesting relationship with Jesus

1214
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
How can you okay

1215
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
Let's hear it

Talking about

1221
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Your Awakening

Travel time on that

1226
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
Number one

1227
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,647
When when

1228
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
You would ask me invented

1229
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,975
The bottom line

1230
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
Bible

1231
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Claire's at the

1232
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
Testimony of Jesus

1233
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
Spirit of Prophecy

1234
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
God is the only

1235
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,703
Supreme deity and being the god of the Bible

1236
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,287
Until the end at the beginning

1237
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,103
And if you do I had an encounter with Jesus

1238
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,895
Physically song

1239
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
He gave me a

1240
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
Panorama

1241
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Yeah he

1242
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
Physically saw Jesus

1243
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,111
What's a panoramic

1244
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:44,767
What we've talked about this before he said this we we've discussed him saying this on the show before

1245
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:51,167
See the beginning of the end see everyday life

1246
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:55,775
Give him every bit of

1247
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:02,175
It's sort of like going through fog you know like you can see something a little bit of head but I'm not going to like not Runaways

1248
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,879
The next talking point God gives it a vision but not like 234 steps down the road

1249
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,671
Panorama

1250
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,951
One thing I've noticed about God

1251
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
Huge fan of plausible deniability

1252
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,607
He loves giving you just enough information to convince

1253
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
Just enough people

1254
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,935
But not enough information to prove it

1255
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,751
Understand strategic flexibility

1256
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,567
He's such a good guy

1257
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:33,919
Does Steve tells the story of meeting Jesus in The Flash

1258
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:40,575
This is the night that Alex lost a billion billion dollars

1259
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,623
In this case Alex I accepted

1260
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,951
Jesus out of Hal Lindsey meeting it's a Student Union building

1261
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,231
I didn't know you know

1262
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,023
Explain to me who Jesus

1263
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,583
First time I had anybody

1264
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,351
Play me Luigi's

1265
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191

1266
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
Elite blocks from

1267
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
Montana State

1268
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,311
I walk into my room which

1269
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,591
I have a bedroom in the basement

1270
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,127
And the bottom line is

1271
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,943
Jesus physically appears by the way I wasn't drunk

1272
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
And I wasn't doing drugs

1273
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
And

1274
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,063
All the sudden

1275
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,815
The glory of the Lord and when I say Glory if you want to know what Jesus

1276
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
Revelation

1277
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
Because

1278
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,703
When he lifted me up and I said Lord

1279
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
Who are you

1280
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
He said I'm Jesus

1281
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
As your savior

1282
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
And I'm

1283
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
Giving you a joke

1284
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
I didn't know who Joe

1285
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,479
When you look into my eyes every cell in my body

1286
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Islam

1287
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,551
Is Forgiven

1288
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,111
I had an understanding

1289
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
The Magnificent

1290
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
Told you one Bible

1291
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
Story

1292
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,047
You know probably maybe one Adam and Eve

1293
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
And the bottom line is

1294
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
It was so overwhelming

1295
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
3 hours

1296
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
Bastide issue

1297
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
Should say pray xeomin

1298
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
And is it in

1299
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
Presence of the Living God

1300
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,615
And after that he told me I would

1301
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
I would know him

1302
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:11,711
Understand this is not a dream it's not a vision this is like

1303
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
Terrafirma on Eartha

1304
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,319
And he said I'd know him don't do that ever again

1305
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
Through his word

1306
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,623
Alex

1307
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,159
Fast forward

1308
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
Experience

1309
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,279
Speak to an Assembly of God pastor

1310
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,839
Because he's the only one that could let me know

1311
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,631
What it meant to have an encounter

1312
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
Oh Jesus Christ

1313
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,471
So he was on campus

1314
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:39,359
Lindsay meeting

1315
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Not knowing

1316
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Everything about

1317
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:45,759
Nothing to do literally knew nothing weird things to do at home

1318
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,039
Yeah it went to the basement

1319
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
IPad 1 boom

1320
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,879
Jesus in The Flash

1321
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Wow

1322
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,975
What are the odds

1323
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,279
Explain to me

1324
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
Explain to me honest

1325
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
What is Jesus going to Mont

1326
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
Gorgeous country

1327
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Balance

1328
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,495
That's

1329
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,287
You know I saw Jesus once

1330
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:14,687
Like actually but not in a romantic Breakneck exactly

1331
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:19,807
I was having so many hallucinations like it was one of my first ones

1332
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,111
I was gone for like 2 or 3 weeks

1333
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:26,975
And I remember seeing Jesus I was playing pool in my basement

1334
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,815
No no

1335
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,095
You can't play pool against Jesus

1336
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,191
But now I remember him like a

1337
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,471
Talking to me

1338
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,775
And II was very much like

1339
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:48,223
Use the horse it was it was cool being in a manic episode when Jesus meets you because at the same time when you're in a manic

1340
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
Episode you like

1341
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:55,391
It's nice to meet you is equals Jesus you know like I'm the savior of humanity you're the savior

1342
01:11:55,647 --> 01:12:00,767
Got a lot in common Manuel it certainly is someone you'd want to meet in a vision other than like

1343
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
Pete

1344
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,399
You know District

1345
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:12,799
It's like what everybody talks about status hallucination

1346
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:16,383
Queen Cleopatra it a bit like if your past life is I was like

1347
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,431
I was David he died at

1348
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
5

1349
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
You know

1350
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,991
Let's not excited

1351
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,647
Selena doll that aside we have Alex doing the show where Steve Quayle is on talking about how he physically met

1352
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:31,743
Jesus and Alex's being like yeah but you did love it

1353
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:40,447
Reality

1354
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:45,567
Believing everything speak whale has to say because he has been

1355
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:51,455
Well I mean I'll just let him know by the Lord

1356
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
Why God

1357
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Shows me a lot of

1358
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,271
You're such a

1359
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Blah blah blah

1360
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
God chose

1361
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
And he

1362
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,879
When he said he'd give me a Joseph Smith

1363
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,951
Prepare the people of God

1364
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,791
As we come into these anti Jose's Ministry

1365
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,351
You know that you've hurt me so many times

1366
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
I always tell people look

1367
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
It's not like I just

1368
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,471
Sit down and figure this stuff out

1369
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,055
His mercy and in his calling to me

1370
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
Opens up events beef

1371
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
Before my eyes and I get flash

1372
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
Four words

1373
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,711
You know so when you talk about Jesus

1374
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,807
No I wasn't

1375
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
I was on

1376
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,855
Heavenly

1377
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
To get up that's

1378
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,207
Been my experience

1379
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Like Moses couldn't even

1380
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
See God

1381
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
It's like

1382
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
I've had it happen

1383
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,583
A couple times I can't even I'm slide

1384
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,863
It's like

1385
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Total knowledge

1386
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,983
God dumpster

1387
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
The data dump

1388
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,615
I think Alex is like I think what he has is night terrors

1389
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,943
Yeah like he's describing not being able to move

1390
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,991
And like so many of

1391
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:01,343
The things that he comes up with are based on movies he seeing

1392
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Horrifying

1393
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,975
And that kind of feels like maybe he wakes up with like sleep paralysis

1394
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:12,095
Like I don't know didn't think that makes total sense to me where is Steve is just

1395
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:18,495
I had a I had a really terrible incidents of sleep paralysis one time I was in this place in f****** blue

1396
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:23,871
Bloomingdale Illinois and you're watching Jesus play pool

1397
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
And

1398
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:28,479
You know that night terror where you do the hallucination think hookup

1399
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:34,879
And there was a man in a wheelchair slowly Wheeling his way into my room in it I don't know why

1400
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:39,999
That is so scary but the speed at which he was doing it was like

1401
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
Wow

1402
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:47,935
He's not even trying to murder me and there's nothing I can do you know there's that kind of lazy as murder

1403
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:54,335
It's not even a hard murder for this dude you no Terror for me would be like if

1404
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,871
Time there and I can't move

1405
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,943
Alright sleep super sleep paralysis

1406
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
I meant like

1407
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:06,111
Kevin the bird comes out and I can't hug

1408
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,183
Derrick Byrd my bad

1409
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:13,535
Yeah I think Alex has night terrors I think Steve is delusional

1410
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:19,167
Good good use of time on this emergency

1411
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,471
Did they lose a billion dollars today

1412
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,263
It's so weird

1413
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,079
Play evil I guess we will be included in that

1414
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,383
Try we're afraid because Steve has met

1415
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
Jesus

1416
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,199
Crazy

1417
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,735
That don't want to admit they're such

1418
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,783
The sickness in the rain

1419
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:35,807
Because this

1420
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,575
Real

1421
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,879
I mean this was like you were able to look at

1422
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
Just like

1423
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,023
Hamburger

1424
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
This is

1425
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
So dumb

1426
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:55,007
Any weight that they spend quite a bit of time on this this emergency episode talking about

1427
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,591
World War 3 Russia School actually

1428
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,151
And then quite a bit about how

1429
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:07,807
I mean that makes sense apocalypse a country where I wouldn't be prosecuted

1430
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:14,207
And the salvation of the Earth yeah that does make sense for us lost a billion dollars

1431
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:20,607
How to be prosecuted Russia for something else

1432
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
Prison food

1433
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:25,471
So Alex said goodbye to Steve Quayle

1434
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
Farewell

1435
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,031
Give the Giants my best

1436
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,079
And some other guests

1437
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,127
Like we got Robert Barnes at work

1438
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,455
Oh my God

1439
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,295
So we're going to sue

1440
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
Call fraud he was ride

1441
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Comeback

1442
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Very short

1443
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:53,375
How dare you

1444
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
Dare you

1445
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,471
Are you get the weather weapons right now

1446
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,263
It took him hours

1447
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:05,919
He tried to get to it right before the verdict in the evening so he's finally getting away with it

1448
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:10,271
Continuity it's a payoff before Barnes shows up

1449
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,855
Tia Barnes coming on I love the idea that like

1450
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,391
He was too busy

1451
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:19,231
I didn't follow through with the case

1452
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,791
The idea that

1453
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071
Barnes

1454
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,095
Was like hey

1455
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
Let's cooperate fully

1456
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,703
And Alex said no

1457
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:35,615
Infuriates me so hard let's do this by the book

1458
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,919
Motive here I swear to God

1459
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:44,575
Barnes is on and the two of them just talk s*** with each other about how you know

1460
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:50,463
Everything is unfair the world is against them they're Heroes everybody's mean

1461
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,863
There seems to be like a through-line between normal so comes on a little bit but both

1462
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Have this like

1463
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,703
Suspicions about how like

1464
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,239
Chris Maddie said

1465
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:06,335
Don't donate to Infowars that's not a good investment not a good bat

1466
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,383
Right and they're like hey

1467
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,431
Shouldn't he be wanting everybody

1468
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,527
Give the money to Infowars because then his clients get more money

1469
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
It's like

1470
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:21,695
I don't think you're making the argument you think you're made they're trying to fundraise off like a

1471
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:27,327
They're trying to fundraise off of them telling their people that they're going to lose their money if they fundraise

1472
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
Yeah

1473
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,471
Secretly we're not going to give them any money

1474
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,543
Yeah it's very weird uncompelling

1475
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:41,663
Define compelling is that Alex I think maybe had a few pops

1476
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,455
Because he seems to be

1477
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,295
No he seems to be communicating a little bit differently

1478
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,831
Again the whole thing

1479
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,855
The billionaire

1480
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,879
Ask everybody

1481
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,927
Was just really meant to do and then

1482
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
You predicted this

1483
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
On the show 20

1484
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,279
Anna Connecticut

1485
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Do you shed

1486
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,423
Yes we know me

1487
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
Two people

1488
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
And when

1489
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
Criticizing

1490
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Here is this

1491
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,383
Texas

1492
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
Major

1493
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
Government official

1494
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
Secretary of State

1495
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
Was he in

1496
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Heart rhythm

1497
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
Every

1498
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
Texas TV station

1499
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
We looked at

1500
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
Said

1501
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Alex Jones

1502
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,815
How you doing buddy

1503
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
Hell

1504
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,631
Questioning

1505
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,423
What 2020

1506
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,079
He seems to be suffering to get these words out

1507
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
It's better to struggle

1508
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,943
I don't know he's like had a few drinks or if like he's just

1509
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,735
Gassed but like it's

1510
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
It's very weird

1511
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,295
I would

1512
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,599
I I swear to you

1513
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
In this

1514
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,647
One instance

1515
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
I cannot

1516
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,511
Judge anyone's Behavior

1517
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:04,095
For the moment after they receive a billion-dollar judge

1518
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
I just

1519
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,679
I don't know how you would behave at Baseline

1520
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,959
Absolutely

1521
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:15,360
I feel like getting absolutely s***-faced beyond all reason makes just as much sense

1522
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:21,760
Anything else and he was wearing a lampshade

1523
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:28,160
Absolutely

1524
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:34,560
Live together yeah that makes more sense than going on trying to defend yourself I would have known

1525
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:39,936
No qualms with that I would have some no confusion nothing no

1526
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:46,336
Nothing to report Alex was wasted you know it's crazy baby it's for the first time in anyone's life

1527
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:51,968
Life you could have truclarity after receiving a billion-dollar Judgment of just like you know what

1528
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:57,856
Literally nothing I do matters at this point you know what I think would be like that

1529
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,160
Episodes from like Wayback

1530
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:05,536
Where he gets really drunk and yelled at Adam Schiff on human skull

1531
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:11,168
That should be what he bet show tonight I'd solutely

1532
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:17,568
Absolute Insanity yeah that would make sense

1533
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:22,432
Play about physically beating Jesus and then is like burping through

1534
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:27,808
I've been sort of banal conversation with Robert Barnes it's like I don't know it's disappointing

1535
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,112
Yeah start screaming about art

1536
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,648
Finding skulls in

1537
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:38,048
And the ways to learn come on buddy I have not said this before too too many people but Alex I think you should

1538
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,072
To get drunk at work

1539
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:45,728
If there ever is a time when everyone would think it's fine totally fine if absolutely yes

1540
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,776
So

1541
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:50,848
Alex just like they're not getting my money

1542
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
And it's long

1543
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,896
People keep

1544
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
Infowars on the air

1545
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,456
Bye-bye Prada

1546
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,736
Anyway

1547
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,016
At good price

1548
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,296
They will lose

1549
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,344
Good prices Barn

1550
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
What are ghost weapons with

1551
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
The bankruptcies

1552
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,928
Regardless of what happens

1553
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
As long as

1554
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,512
The people stick with

1555
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
They cannot break

1556
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
Through that line and don't notice

1557
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
Chris Mattie said that

1558
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
I don't

1559
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
Give

1560
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
Air money

1561
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,240
Supposedly his finest are going to get it

1562
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,544
He doesn't want that

1563
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
Absolutely

1564
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,272
But they've figured out

1565
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,040
Is that

1566
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
The audience

1567
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
Forza live

1568
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
And they thought they

1569
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
Looks Maricamp

1570
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Republic show

1571
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,976
The show trials are all about

1572
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
To be able to

1573
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,304
Get the audience

1574
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
To turn

1575
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,096
Away

1576
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,376
Infowars

1577
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,544
I think the journey past the stevequayle portion of this

1578
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,824
Episode is

1579
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,872
Just kind of the same s***

1580
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,432
He says with Barnes normally yeah

1581
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,504
And then it just a progression of him

1582
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,552
Audibly falling apart okay

1583
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,576
It's about getting it

1584
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
Audience

1585
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
10. Listen

1586
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
Did not supported

1587
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
Denali braces

1588
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,256
Itself

1589
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,048
O'Reilly's

1590
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Point

1591
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Hey

1592
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,632
I hate the audience

1593
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
So I can hear it there

1594
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
Don't give a

1595
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,240
I don't want my

1596
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,520
Honey

1597
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
What about that

1598
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
About silencing

1599
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
The best

1600
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,760
And what they wanted people to

1601
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
Begin to self C

1602
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Supportive info

1603
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,136
Go to Barnes trying to do some heavy lifting

1604
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,184
To like carry the weight there

1605
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,280
Yeah you can even get a little bit of that vibe off Alex and it's not

1606
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,096
It's not inspiring I feel like the

1607
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:52,704
Traditional like stereotypical child of divorce you know with that like

1608
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:56,544
Hypersensitivity towards the moods of sirte

1609
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,824
People I still like

1610
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:04,224
Oh I know what happens next whenever this type of tone like when Alex starts talk

1611
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,296
Walking without that kind of thing it's like

1612
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:13,696
Oh man I'm so hypersensitive that like I know what's coming man you know

1613
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
Like not

1614
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,512
Be seeming like I'm being a

1615
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,304
How to use or anything there is no like

1616
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
Blow up

1617
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:25,984
He just seemed not on air

1618
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,848
Really going on that doesn't inspire a lot of

1619
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,152
Confidence

1620
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
So Barnes

1621
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,272
Set some shity things

1622
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,320
Was never about

1623
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,624
It was never about

1624
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,904
Other families

1625
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,184
They were simply

1626
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
Tool by which

1627
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
They could

1628
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,256
Try to

1629
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,792
Shame the Infowars audio

1630
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:50,816
The silencing

1631
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
But I'm proud of you

1632
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,752
Stay right there let's

1633
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,128
What you guys go back

1634
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,664

1643
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,936
Hey that's

1644
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:34,336
Compound problem that is far beyond Barnes has ability to understand at all mutually exclusive

1645
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,152
Naruto in fact almost

1646
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
In their relationship

1647
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:45,344
Norm says a lot of basically the same s*** that he said with with Owen Earl

1648
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,368
Earlier and

1649
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,648

Talks

1652
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:58,656
In court I will say there was one moment that I didn't cut a clip from but I thought was pretty cute and that was like Alex asked Barnes

1653
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:03,264
Oh I'm sorry I've been talking too much

1654
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,544
Haters going to hate man

Nuclear war

1660
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,184
They've killed twenty million people with poison

1661
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,256
Being a man of the year

1662
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,584
Globalstar for me

1663
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,888

1664
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
Kids

1665
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704

1673
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,504
Shameful Barnes

1674
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
It is a

1675
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,880
Moment maybe one of these most

1676
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,648
Shane Pomona

1677

History of American law

1678
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:59,328
I thought you meant the show we're doing right now

1679
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:04,960
Sorry I misread that never said anything more true unintentional

1680
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:09,312
That's the most adults the most true thing I think he's ever said honestly

1681
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,104
Alex like

1682
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,128
Being like

1683
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
F*** it

1684
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
Alewife

1685
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,712
Give us money or don't come get it

1686
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:22,880
That is still like a desperate plea for money it is the appearance of like I do

1687
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:26,464
Yeah totally

1688
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,536
I have got so much money I mean

1689
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:35,680
Powerful I've got the will I got the will to give me your money or not

1690
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,776
But seriously it's not

1691
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,824
It does lead

1692
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
To Alex doing the interesting

1693
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
Unplug

1694
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,664
And it leads me to think

1695
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,968
Things are worse than he wants to let all

1696
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
But I mean

1697
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:49,760
Can you donate better

1698
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:50,784

01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,160

1701
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
Money

1702
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
The lost cause

1703
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,488
He needs your loss

1704
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
He wants to break

1705
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,584
He hates the show

1706
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
Because I'm a focal

1707
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,144
Liberty and freedom

1708
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,704

1709
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
But I'm not worried

1710
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,176
And

1711
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,456
So many of them,

1712
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
But I've got

1713
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
More to do in the fight

1714
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,160

477

1728
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,640
So the idea of this coin

1729
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:55,040
Is we're selling it at a high market rate fundraiser for the show

1730
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,832
If you want to buy this

1731
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
It cost more

1732
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,672
But it's symbolic

1733
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
Right

1734
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,488
Now

1735
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,024
We're offering this

1736
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:11,936
The way cheaper

1737
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,240
The fundraisers good

1738
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:19,872
But we got to get the s*** out of here commitment to the idea of that fundraiser

1739
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:26,272
It has no chill to it really stinky desperation

1740
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,600
What exactly do you think I'm going to do

1741
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,648
With 20,000 coins

1742
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
With no value

1743
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:37,024
Nothing create a Teddy Roosevelt room

1744
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,608
Oh yeah that that to me was a sign of

1745
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,728
You gotta move these f****** coin and we need whatever we can make on them

1746
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:50,592
Now f*** the fundraiser thing they need some money slowed

1747
01:29:54,176 --> 01:30:00,320
And raucous Applause from everybody I think Chris Maddie called in was like that guy

1748
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,648
That you apologized and now we know none of that

1749
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:06,720

Weird quite good-looking goodnight

1780

Very different tone of good luck

1781
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,136
What kind of luck

1782
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:13,024
Does the audience need here whatever if you just told me an hour ago

1783
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:16,096
That nuclear war was inevitable good luck with

1784
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:18,656
And there's no stopping

1785
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472

Good luck

1787
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:27,360
I will call in this individually find myself quite uninspired

1788
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:30,688
Look we have the billion-dollar.

1789
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,736
And obviously

1790
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,832
Alice's response at in the moment is about what you'd expect

1791
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:42,720
Cheering it on and started making the game

1792
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,000
That's

1793
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
What it is

1794
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,816
Later on in the evening

1795
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,144
He does his emergency show and

1796
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,424
At this point

1797
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,984
I would say the mission

1798
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,544
It's best you could possibly do

1799
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:03,456
Do a show that lays out some hard-hitting information that the globalists don't want people to have right

1800
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Prove your worth

1801
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,808
Right do something that is undeniably great

1802
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,344
Because here's the deal

1803
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,160
I've already f****** knows that you lost a billion dollars

1804
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,696
Audience knows that

1805
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,792
Do you need money you don't have to be a desperate weirdo

1806
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:24,448
Do something don't spend a f****** hour with Barnes & Noble complaining and whining about now

1807
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
Nonsense

1808
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:28,032
Do something that really changes the game

1809
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,080
Because you probably have the most eyes

1810
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,408
Possible on things the most attention the most

1811
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,736
Like if your mission is really about an information War

1812
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
Information

1813
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:43,904
Don't spend time talking with Steve Quayle about how he physically met Jesus

1814
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,184
Don't do that

1815
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
It to me

1816
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,488
The reason that he did that

1817
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,512
It's cuz he has nothing

1818
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:53,120
There isn't something else that he can do but there's no elevation

1819
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:57,984
No no there's no way that he can be like the rest go back to basic

Politeness through. Give him a lesson in manners and I found that to be disappointing
