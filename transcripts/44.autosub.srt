1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,616
We're couple dudes you like to sit around slightly different introduction today

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,384
That's right

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
Fake news

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
I'm not drinking wine

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,832
Unfortunately all too real news

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,416
I don't want to come to you with the pity party

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
It's not what I'm about but I

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
You want to say

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,304
I think that this show

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
Is taking a massive effect on my mental how

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
Which is something We've joked about in the past

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
And people have expected

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
And unfortunately it's kind of true

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
I think

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
Maybe you were joking

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,456
You can't listen to copious hours of Alex Jones

18
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,784
And not having to take some sort of negative toll on you

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,112
I am a combination of excessive drinking

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,696
In my life

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Reinforce

22
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
Drink menu list

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
Alex Jones

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,424
For comfort

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Yeah yeah yeah

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
It's a it's a disaster

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,872
Moving forward we're going to stop drinking wine

28
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
We're going to start drinking

29
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
Comical beverages

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,808
Until today we've got strawberry and Perrier plan forever

31
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
Yeah

32
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
Whatever Alex

33
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
Cuz doing to me

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
Over

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Not

36
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
Because I do believe the word

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Doing something

38
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,544
Important important than most of what else were doing

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:53,152
Myself that I would listen to him everyday for a year

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,224
What kind of games are no matter what happens

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
Cancel my mental health

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
We stopped doing

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
Michelle

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,952
Make it to that point I am going

45
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
You need to

46
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Here's the thing

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
Alex makes me very mad

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
But it's not because

49
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
I'm triggered

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
Or anything like that

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
The experience of listening to his show is madness

52
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Because I know his lies

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,336
At this point we've been doing this I've been listening everyday for like

54
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
It's five and a half months

55
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
I know all of his little lies

56
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
The waypoints I researched them

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
And I know they're bulshit

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
So whenever a new tragedy happen

59
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Narrative room to go down

60
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,952
And he just uses the same lines to reinforce them

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
It's so frustrating cuz there's no winning

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
There's no winning against the guy who's that like

63
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
Bombastic and entertaining

64
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
With

65
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Stat-wise

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Commitment

67
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
2 is

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Alternate route

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Yeah and so that's what

70
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
That's what's hurting my mental health

71
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200
Is listening to it and realizing like

72
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Where

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
The knowledge fight is ultimately pointless

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
And that's great

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,184
But if the end goal is making a difference at all we can

76
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
That's really what

77
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,704
I don't know if that makes any sense or anything but

78
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
In order to deal with that frustration and how all-encompassing that is how much it makes me really afraid

79
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
Place

80
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Shittyfood

81
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
Irresponsibility with

82
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
More meditation in my life

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Exercise

84
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
So

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
Will negotiate on that last

86
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,608
Sure

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Is that Rodger Stone might today

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
Barrels

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
I don't know what that mean

90
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
Might be the etymology

91
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
Maybe or is Simon a pickle Barrel

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,672
I don't

93
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Or

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
When you're really poor you have to wear a barrel

95
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,655
Turn on cartoon

96
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,591
More real

97
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,711
We're going to be going over a special report that Alex put out

98
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
Okay finally finally

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,647
We're going to do that because people have been asking about on Twitter

100
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
And then on top of that

101
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
The world

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
I don't

103
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
I don't

104
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
Allison very predictable

105
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
I don't want to talk about it

106
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
I don't want talk about his insane Muslim dating

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
I am

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Beer tax

109
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Yep if you read

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Reports from people in

111
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
London

112
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
In England

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,063
You hear a lot of really positive stories about people helping each other

114
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
And

115
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
About not being

116
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
Bound by fear

117
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Dumbass Texas

118
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
Hey screaming

119
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
That sort of thing

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Can I just don't care

121
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
It's

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,215
It's so cookie-cutter for him that I just don't even want to do it

123
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
People are already

124
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Kick them out of our

125
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
They're doing it before

126
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Anyway

127
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
I've got a special report

128
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
And I don't want to tell you what it's about

129
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
I want to just let you

130
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
I'm going to play the first

131
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,671
Could trick you that fast I'm going to play the first clip and imma let you try and guess

132
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
What he's talking about

133
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,583
Ladies and gentlemen film 06 Central 7 Eastern 5

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
56

135
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Central Time

136
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,471
This is my day off today I took a day off

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Suspension children

138
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
And the family

139
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
And

140
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,735
I had to come back in the day because of major major

141
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,927
Wards.com

142
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,511
Important

143
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
Just on Google News alone

144
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,215
Trump and Israel

145
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
But

146
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
It's not his real what is

147
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,175
The biggest breaking news with Alex Jones

148
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
On his day off

149
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
6:00 at night

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
To discuss

151
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
In a special report

152
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
What do you think it is

153
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Intelligent

154
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Were asked

155
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Specifically

156
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
And personally by

157
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
To interfere

158
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Beer with the FBI

159
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
Not that one

160
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
No but it's not the most

161
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
If works

162
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
That's the only thing I can make news

163
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
If we're going to play hot and cold that's Isis

164
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Alright

165
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
How about

166
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
See what else is going on in the

167
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Did somebody talk about Alex

168
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
Warmer

169
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:39,775
Not directly towards Alex

170
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Tertiary Ali

171
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
Who but I do want to

172
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Corsi has

00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
Select a story

174
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
Today is not Trump and Israel

175
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Infowars

176
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
And there are over 3,000

177
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
Google has 3,000

178
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
Oh my God

179
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
He was watching that number climb

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,039
Jerking off the results

181
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Totally

182
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
The day off just to

183
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135

Again

188
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
Course we got credentials baby

189
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
I saw that and I

190
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
I'm just sitting there going

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
We just did an episode where he

192
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Blissey laid out

193
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Plan

194
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
To wage a

195
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,711
Literal propaganda war against Americans

196
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,063
His argument because Edward Bernays trained me

197
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
Uniquely capable at Justice

198
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Groin propaganda

199
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
The campaign

200
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
Cuz I think he does bring it up later

201
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
That like

202
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,191
Jerome corsi knows how to pierce through propaganda campaign

203
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,663
Where in the training manual was like the only way to fight propaganda

204
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
Is with even more

205
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
I honestly think that that is what

206
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
Oh actually yeah that's pretty much exactly

207
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
Absolutely would be

208
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
So

209
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Oh man I just got real sad

210
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,935
The specifics about it and we'll talk about sad the realities and

211
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
Really all that terrible you got a week

212
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Pastor

213
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,127
Alex even admits as much

214
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
Almost episodes

215
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
High School

216
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
There's a couple things

217
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
You might be in my school

218
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Is this

219
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Speaker

220
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Breaking news

221
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Course

222
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
Is going to be spending a week in the White House

223
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
And then the rest of it

224
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
Life Underground

225
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
If he shows up at the White House with John Cena you know something's up with

226
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
I want to bring up

227
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
One is that

228
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
Alex doing everything wrong

229
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
Cuz he's engaged with Stephen Colbert

230
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
The historic buckford character

231
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Stephen Colbert's just

232
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,839
Clowning on Alex Alex

233
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Enjoyable

234
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
We're not going to take anybody

235
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
I wish anyone cared as much about what we do is

236
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
I'm not better

237
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,135
That's a good point I started I can neither prove nor disprove your claim

238
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Back when I was

239
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
Letterman Leno

240
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:16,607
Those Island

241
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
YouTube

242
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Because you didn't know any better answer happen

243
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
He should not be engaging at all

244
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Colbert

245
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Do whatever he wants

246
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Colbert is incredibly funny

247
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
She's always going to win

248
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
It's always going to be

249
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
Alex is lying about everything

250
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
We can't win with the truth

251
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,143
It's only going to get more ammunition for Colbert to make fun of if Alex gets mad

252
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
There's no win for him

253
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Just ignore it

254
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
You f****** up there

255
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,567
Now the rest of this episode

256
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Even a moment

257
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Maybe I should

258
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Every

259
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Single

260
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Time

261
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Mangos

262
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Oh I got to say something about this

263
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
Immediately every time Google result

264
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
We're making fun of him

265
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,423
Got to take a little more Superbowl vitality

266
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
The first thing he's f****** up big time right now

267
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,079
The second thing is f****** up big-time is how he respond

268
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
In this episode

269
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
People's criticism

270
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
About corsi getting pressed

271
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Right

272
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Should waive his dick around

273
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
She is a troll

274
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:46,207
Write the whole thing isn't the course he is in the Press Corps he's legitimate

275
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,583
That's not what's going on they're just doing it to show him at the White House to piss people off

276
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,983
Yeah that's why Jack pasovic went for a day that's why that's why Mike cernovich went for a date

277
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
To piss people off

278
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,823
That's what these all right

279
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Good optic

280
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
Cuz you are going to make people mad Levi

281
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,991
And then all of a sudden they're talking about you

282
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
This is super defensive

283
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
This episode

284
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
Incredibly defensive

285
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
And Alex's

286
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
Well

287
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,975
He should just be like my guys in there

288
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
Sukkot libtards

289
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,863
Perfect that's a perfect angle

290
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:30,239
Does this instead of of

291
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Having White House press credentials

292
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
We fought about

293
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,663
We thought

294
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
Then you put it in for daily that you get weekly

295
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
Because eventually that we going to run out

296
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
No he's worried that

297
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
He's going to get it

298
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
From his team

299
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
He's worried that he's going to get the

300
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,127
OU sold out

301
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Bingo

302
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
It's not about

303
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
It's not about us

304
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Anymore this is

305
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
Infowars

306
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
You dumbass follower

307
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,071
Butte

308
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,447
Suggested there in the middle was a little bit

309
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
It's going to be like

310
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Then you go with the weekly that's course

311
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,527
They don't even do permanent anymore

312
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
So he's already given up that

313
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
This is probably the best we're going to do

314
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
Don't expect more from us

315
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
I don't know about

316
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
If they don't do permanent I think the New York Times

317
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
As a permanent eating their not rotating out the New York

318
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,567
Game time for Washington

319
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
Ice maker

320
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,711
I think it becomes a conversation every time I tried to

321
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
Lest you think that's

322
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
The limit

323
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Alex's

324
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
It's about this situation

325
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,695
Okay he gets super defensive and then gets defensive about his own pass

326
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:31,839
I am about an accusation

327
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Which is super fun

328
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,871
Ears

329
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,039
Access TV

330
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
73

331
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Check

332
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
What's going on here

333
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
But of course I started out

334
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,959
Years old

335
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:15,359
By 21 years old 20 years old

336
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,175
Oh it's amazing this guy

337
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Read all the people

338
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,463
No it's all he was on

339
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,863
I don't think anyone feels that way I don't think anyone cares but he was on exit TV

340
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
TV

341
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:43,775
Stop

342
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,711
I think Alex having roots and look like this

343
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
Makes them cool

344
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
Local

345
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,647
I've considered every day of my life

346
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,463
I don't know how to do it

347
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,583
Alright let's check into it

348
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751
So you're right I mean like it is

349
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:20,639
Your radio show haven't because your dad bought an add-on radio and pimped pics with the producers

350
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Yep like

351
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,503
You're not I mean

352
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
The case of a

353
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Self made

354
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Millionaire

355
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,439
It's always pull myself up

356
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,255
It helped that my dad had 14 million

357
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
It was a bonus

358
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
But he only gave me one

359
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
More than a million

360
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
So

361
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,151
People

362
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
Hate him cuz he was on public access

363
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Knox

364
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Because

365
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,807
He's a liar

366
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Super defensive

367
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Everything

368
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
This school

369
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
20 minute clip

370
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Is a greatest hits

371
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,559
Of all like his fun current lies

372
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Like Eli's about pizzagate

373
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
He lies a little bit about Chobani

374
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,471
He lies a little bit about his this one right here

375
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
This next clip

376
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Is about his newest

377
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
Narrative

378
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
Yes the thing about Comey lying to

379
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,967
We didn't actually play him talking about it I just explained it

380
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,039
So here we go here's Alex not understanding

381
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
The fake narrative he's pushing with gum

382
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,255
This isn't about me but the media is totally upset they got a bunch of news articles Daily Beast

383
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,583
Alex Jones helped push up the stock market East dangerous

384
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Well that's the clip

385
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,551
They just say I'm a liar but admittedly boots in the stock market

386
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
It's crazy

387
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,815
It was two-plus months ago that the memo was supposedly written and then

388
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Month later on May 3rd

389
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,519
Tomi testifies that no one not the attorney-general no one quote no one

390
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Contradiction before Congress or the memos alive which they won't show us so that's probably a lot

391
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Probably

392
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Not great

393
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Migrating owls

394
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,719
What do you say

395
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Nope, he was asked

396
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,351
Specifically about the attorney general or officials with the Department of Justice

397
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Alex

398
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
Alex is trying to say that just because you said

399
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,383
Tony's answer doesn't relate to the question he was at

400
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
I just because you said that hasn't happened to Mike.

401
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
Answering question about the.

402
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Alex just takes the

403
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
That hasn't happened.

404
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,463
Text is unnecessary it hasn't happened in my experience

405
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Never

406
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Yeah

407
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,327
Congress

408
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,167
The Daily Beast article that came out apparently

409
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
I do I don't know what the f*** this article was talking

410
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
But apparently the stock market

411
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
Take a little bit of a jump

412
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,407
I am they attributed to Traders

413
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
Alex covering this, equip

414
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,831
And the idea that Trump wasn't in trouble and they told me himself was in trouble

415
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Make them by

416
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Hazel

417
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,231
Places where they found out it was fake

418
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
And it went down

419
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
Most of those training

420
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Are built now around algor

421
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
Jeff

422
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
And if there is enough

423
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
There's enough of these certain

424
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Keywords

425
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
That it will change that's why there was that one day

426
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
There's suddenly a massive crash

427
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
Is because all the algorithms

428
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Wiped out

429
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,304
That

430
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
What we pointed out

431
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
About how

432
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Specific question

433
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Understand

434
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
That at all

435
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
In the article old clip

436
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Alex

437
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
Cuz he can't wrestle with

438
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Incontact

439
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
Adjust glommed onto the fact that

440
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Sure that parts

441
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,792
This is why

442
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
Why he's f******

443
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
This is why use propaganda

444
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Cuz he can't not under

445
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
A child could understand

446
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,544
If you can't understand that I don't think

447
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
You could tie a shoe

448
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
That's our new conspiracy

449
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,088
To be fair I has anybody seen Alex public wearing anything other than

450
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Velcro

451
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
Slip on shoes

452
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
And I will give him this

453
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
Those shoes that have roller

454
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
The soap shoes

455
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
My grind shoes

456
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:34,496
Can jump on Rails and posts

457
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:40,896
I'm thinking specifically the ones where the wheels pop out on the bottom

458
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
The ones with lights

459
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
Is that like lights

460
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
This is bulshit

461
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Yes just b*******

462
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
So when Alex

463
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,744
In this world defensive thing about Sony press credentials to be legitimate

464
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
I want to talk about how we made the stock market go up with our fake s***

465
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
It's not fake

466
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
They think it's two weeks old

467
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
His argument is that

468
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Has to be

469
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
B-real

470
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Because the stock market was

471
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Was affected by

472
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
No

473
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
No

474
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
He's saying

475
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
But it has to be real because he

476
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
I mean it is in Jesus

477
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
His criticism of the daily

478
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
So you saying that they put out this article

479
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
Saying that he was fake

480
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
And yet

481
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Because look

482
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
The stock market is real

483
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
True

484
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,800
I think there's an even more interesting argument to be made it's really dangerous when bulshit

485
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
Makes the market go up

486
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Because

487
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,504
We're going to economy where we're sort of incentive eyes to lie

488
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
Yeah

489
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
So Jordan you might be asking yourself

490
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
What am I asking myself

491
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Asking myself that but

492
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
Myself has Alex Jones

493
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
Ever held

494
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
A puppy in his arms

495
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
The truth of life

496
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Whoever looked

497
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,216
Himself in a dog's eyes

498
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Maybe

499
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
When he strangled Nong

500
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
Oh man

501
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,432
You're really set on this narrative that he get to killing off his bare hands

502
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
I think there's no other reasonable explanation

503
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Super where we are at

504
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,672
Talk about his drunken rambling about exactly

505
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
1 + 1 makes 2 exactly

506
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
I wonder about that myself

507
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
More

508
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
I know that everyone

509
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
When were the memos

510
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Bye

511
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,544
To kill knock in order to become a man

512
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
I'll look it up and reported in Fortune 500

513
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
We can't report on that right now

514
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,904
Without a doubt we have calls out exactly Alex Jones

515
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Refused

516
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,048
He has commented on

517
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
Is this next bulshit story

518
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Prudential

519
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
You got the medium running

520
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
Thousands of news articles an hour

521
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,920
Top story what are the top stories in the United States right now

522
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,368
They put out the same disinfo

523
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,512
But I didn't get them

524
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,328
We were told to get press passes

525
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
We can't refuse you anyway

526
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,736
Best-selling author

527
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,856
Presidential candidates

528
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,048
2012

529
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
Yes I was trying to get movies

530
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,416
Where's the paperwork make shop

531
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
They say where are you

532
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
We want you here

533
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,728
Okay

534
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:57,408
How's this spacer Twilight select moving from side to side

535
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Which part of the covers a

536
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088
And he's on today character

537
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
Cerveza.

538
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,512
That's bad you got to turn your head to the right to the left

539
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Alright

540
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
Over to my shop after the show

541
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
I can come over

542
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
With your wife

543
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,592
That is so that's not how Alex talk

544
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
A lot of the time

545
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,456
It kind of makes me think that was based on a real conversation he had with somebody

546
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
That is that is well

547
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
That's a lot less

548
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Detailed

549
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Yeah

550
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
This man

551
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:48,864
Macaque

552
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Amazing

553
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Legit

554
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
That's that's what he's really missing

555
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Mention any

556
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
Waiting time

557
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
That it was a legitimate

558
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
Let's assume it was

559
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Which is

560
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
Which is something he does not

561
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Austin to because it is

562
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Never

563
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
B people he's talking to our legitimate

564
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
He has to certify it

565
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
Which does Dublin

566
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Exterior thought that it was a real

567
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
Can I be clear what I think happened

568
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
No

569
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,384
OK Google

570
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Or at the very least

571
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
Obfuscate

572
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
I definitely don't

573
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
Think that someone like Mike

574
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Flynn

575
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,392
Said hey you should get press credentials

576
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,280
I definitely don't think that that's probably what happened

577
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,400
But like he wasn't in such hot water

578
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
It was more like

579
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,432
Is that one still got to do any good lawyers

580
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
Oh okay so it's not in this episode

581
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
But man

582
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
He's been spending a Chobani s*** hard

583
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Yeah I believe it

584
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
He's been saying that okay so Colbert

585
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
I talked about on his like

586
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
In one of his jokes

587
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:30,240
The character called tuck Buckner

588
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Yes

589
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
It's becoming

590
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,640
The most one-sided War ever

591
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Alex

592
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
That's dangerous

593
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,832
Stephen Colbert has finally alerted how much more

594
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Full on

595
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,488
Villa Rosa

596
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,840
Outside doesn't understand humor

597
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
Stuff

598
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,448
Said that he lost in court without

599
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
Retraction

600
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Didn't lose

601
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
If he wasn't

602
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
F***** over a bear

603
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
Otherwise

604
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
Context clues

605
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
And figure that out

606
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
Colbert said he had to pay out a settlement

607
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Isn't public

608
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
Really knows

609
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
True

610
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Because it was a private

611
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Settlement

612
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
So I don't know if Alex

613
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Colbert said it but he didn't say anything

614
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Specific

615
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
But Alex took

616
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
The Chobani told him

617
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,712
What the secret settlement was

618
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,064
Because it's all of talking PR stunt

619
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,904
Play Giovanni

620
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
So

621
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,512
I don't know

622
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,608
I have a broken mentally ill

623
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
That's always great up

624
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,984
Push with negative associate in their brand with him

625
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,824
Especially after they settle them down

626
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Gyros

627
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,688
Maybe just no no

628
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,648
4-barrel

629
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Good man

630
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,024
So Alec believes that is talked about it

631
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
Chobani is cold

632
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
Colbert the lawsuit details

633
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Enzo Alex

634
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
Put Chobani on notice

635
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:43,616
Told them not to destroy any documents

636
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
How do you spell albino double jeopardy

637
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:52,832
Tickets for the same thing

638
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
Again that you've already scheduled for

639
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Also

640
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,264
Like it wouldn't even be possible for them to share that information

641
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,592
Unless they didn't have a non-disclosure

642
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,152
Within the settlement agreement

643
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
I think they do

644
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:27,136
Because otherwise it would be public information

645
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
Teepublic reviews

646
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
So of course

647
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
He knows that your body could

648
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
Possibly

649
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,144
Yeah but he's got to try and win somehow and that's how he's doing

650
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216
Counter sue them for disclosing

651
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
Settlement

652
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
He is very happy about it

653
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
Yeah because you didn't get destroyed

654
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Packing House

655
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,512
Okay to him for the article the slander of their their article liquid

656
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
S*** rolls downhill

657
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Going to land on Alex's

658
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,216
Downhill

659
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Definitely not Alex Jones

660
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,824
Downhill downhill from

661
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
David Knight is like

662
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,920
Corsi

663
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,712
Corpse

664
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Jerome corsi

665
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,160
What is the buck stops without

666
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
But he owns

667
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,144
But you know they don't want Reese to him for that

668
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,472
The stuff you talked about that episode that we went over

669
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
Pictures of something for that

670
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:52,896
He's doubling down on everything like okay you're off the hook on that one but here we go

671
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,224
So

672
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,344
Get some of that settle money first I don't want to do that

673
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
Good man

674
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,440
The other thing that Alex has been doing that's really funny

675
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Is

676
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
Because

677
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Is Buick

678
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
Get free pretending to be a fake Alex

679
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Is pretending to be a fake

680
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Stephen Colbert

681
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
No but

682
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,288
Keep getting the point

683
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
And he's quickly deconstructing the B

684
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
He's doing what

685
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
He's going through

686
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Alex

687
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:35,904
Is going line-by-line

688
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,000
Itsfunneh itsfunneh conceptually that he's doing it but it's

689
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,304
I listen to a new wooden play on this

690
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
I don't have any of that

691
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
But one thing

692
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,216
A1 Colbert's monologue she's like

693
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,056
Claim that Chobani is bringing

694
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Spread tuberculosis

695
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
Which we all know is Yoplait

696
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
Alex response to that wasn't

697
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
Alright we made that joke

698
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
But I think we used an app

699
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,768
Slander

700
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
Why does

701
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
Omani just

702
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Play jokes

703
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Does he have a

704
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,432
Wherever like in his real life no I don't think so

705
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
He's a man with

706
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Without humor

707
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
Deborah

708
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
He's a big he's a sad man

709
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
Cuz all the last

710
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,952
Yeah he's the weird dude

711
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
You know you getting defensive

712
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
He's talking about how we don't need

713
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
For credibility

714
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
But that's not enough

715
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,240
It's not enough for Alex and Infowars

716
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
They have to go one step further

717
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
Are very extended way

718
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
Cook-Out the Press Corps

719
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
Real heart

720
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
So he's

721
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
These credentials and it does

722
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Same time

723
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,720
All over these merry credential

724
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
He got

725
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,560
Totally the wrong angle

726
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,704
These credentials

727
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,312
Office

728
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,152
Those are three things Alex keeps bringing up I assume that's it

729
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
But I mean

730
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,248
Guessing it's a slightly more complicated

731
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
We need you to have an office in a driver

732
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
Rubber stamp

733
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Good

734
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
So here go your ears with a cocking

735
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Begins

736
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
Here's what's going on

737
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:55,936
What's going house press credentials

738
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
In a way

739
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
Spokesman a woman

740
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,552
And then we hear what the president

741
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,792
Flights

742
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
We look at stock numbers

743
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
We look at reality

744
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,496
Show me other experts

745
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
But ocean came out

746
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
Do you understand

747
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,560
There's coursing there's coursing at the White House

748
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,888
True

749
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728
They came out and said Infowars was correct

750
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Is such a

751
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
Such a funny thing

752
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
For him to save

753
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
The first lie is of course

754
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
The way that

755
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
Doesn't come out and say

756
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,016
Mason said

757
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
The information

758
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
That Infowars game

759
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,880
That

760
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
What Infowars reported on Wii

761
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Was correct

762
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
Alex

763
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,816
Came out and said Infowars is correct

764
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,632
As a whole.

765
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
The other part of that

766
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
Is know that absolutely did not have

767
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
Totally

768
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,896
He doubles down on the One Lending himself credibility by having

769
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
High updos

770
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,248
Look at how right info

771
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,552
The time we're just confirming info

772
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Already told you

773
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
That's me is great

774
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
Because that distract from the fact that

775
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,816
Like that's a brilliant little move there

776
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
Jerome corsi broke a story that's not true

777
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:06,496
And we've been over it

778
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:10,848
We've explained both versions of the

779
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:16,224
The penny Freddy's story that they tried to pull one couple months back couple weeks ago

780
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
We've been over there both not true they're both

781
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
F****** lies

782
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
Do you mnuchin confirmed it

783
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
A fertilized

784
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,512
Don't understand

785
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,376
Only frustration

786
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
So if you

787
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,216
You keep on lying eventually people finally

788
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Forget the old

789
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,848
And move on to the new score man we got it we got

790
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
Sucking mnuchin telling us words

791
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
Genright

792
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
I do believe him when he says

793
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
They don't need

794
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
To be in the Press Corps to

795
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
To legitimize

796
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,344
That sure is fuk is

797
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Isn't going to happen

798
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,768
Where they are the people who think that they're legitimate

799
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,888
So he's not done cutting up a press Corps

800
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Losses in a little bit

801
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,944
Controversy in January February March and April that we were Liars

802
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:30,976
If you got

803
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,024
D.c. license

804
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
They can't block you

805
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,936
From your press credentials

806
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
Has a PHD in international finance from Harvard

807
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
A New York Times best sellers

808

11 presidential

809
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
So real quick

810
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
Swift boat veterans

811
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,520
Torpedo John Kerry's campaign

812
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
The fact that he helped

813
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,432
Alex you hate George W bush

814
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,576
Hydrocodone that you know that light rack

815
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:33,696
He was responsible for

816
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,144
It's so stupid

817
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
So f****** stupid

818
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,192
If it was

819
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Like some sort of

820
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,800
IPic nationalist win in that election

821
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,895
Corsican taking down carry

822
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:58,271
I don't think Alex do is jerk him off here regarding

823
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
So much as

824
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,391
Look at how powerful that affected his property

825
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
It's hard to argue against it like you heard about the

826
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
The Swift boat V

827
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,095
Like

828
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,887
According to

829
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:21,823
My dad thought it was water bottles

830
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,943
Whole Hog on it and you got to go

831
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
Successful

832
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,551
Millions of people murdered

833
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,343
Fasting for workout

834
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Also his number

835
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
We're about how Obama birth certificate is fake

836
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
And how about Obama's illegitimate

837
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
Sellers

838
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
I don't get it

839
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
I don't get it does Alex

840
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,455
Okay if I was just really impressed by this

841
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
He have to be superficial as f***

842
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,831
And really only care about the fact

843
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,623
And a book

844
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Because if

845
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Look beneath the surface

846
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,511
Right under that rock is George h.w. Bush

847
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
And then also under that rock is

848
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,351
Oh no

849
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
Oh no

850
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
I have to be a birther now

851
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
I don't think Alex wants to talk about the

852
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,847
Your initial statement Alex The Superficial of s***

853
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
You could have just stopped right

854
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,431
Well I'm just trying to give an alternative

855
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,295
He superficial is because the alternative is I'm thrilled with Georgia

856
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,623
George W bush being president

857
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
Yeah you're right he doesn't need that

858
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
Think it was

859
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
Right but who cares

860
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Like it was

861
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,727
Even with the wars man

862
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,263
Abstruse

863
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
She's going to torpedo

864
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,687
Control over the propaganda

865
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:08,575
If you got working for World News Daily anyone like North Korea we've got the bomb

866
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,391
Anyway he's a more positive things to say about course hero

867
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Disagree with all of

868
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,871
Exposed

869
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,439

870
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,127
Is that

871
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,199
About it

872
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Sprint car

873

00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
You think you don't

876
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,135
You think you're better than course

877
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,719
International Sia

878
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,607
Fictional organization is almost ready to talk about

879
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
He wouldn't even talk about it until exactly one week ago to his Great Bend

880
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,895
Take all of it

881
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:43,295
Also that Hillary was being paid by the Chinese government

882
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
Choose on the payroll

883
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,367
I'm at Eric's family have been threatened

884
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:50,207
He's going to be back on to talk about

885
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
Still never come on

886
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,071
He's almost ready to talk

887
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,983
Amendatory has never really has a much better lawyers don't go anywhere.

888
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,591
Don't make any insinuations you can't backup

889
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Yeah

890
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,151
Currently says about other people

891
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
Lie about yourself all the f*** you want who's going to watch the lion of slander for a long

892
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,671
These were miraculously not been destroyed by all the bulshit he's done

893
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,999
But now is where the episode take a harsh turn

894
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:29,631
It's just been like that we need the press credentials but also we

895
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:36,031
Everyone hates us cuz we're so truthful

896
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,079
Full of integrity

897
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Fake meat

898
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,015
Documented

899
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Episode

900
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,647
Superficially in this episode as well as easy as not being

901
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
Yeah he's a dick

902
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,743
Alex

903
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
The talks about

904
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
The why the media attacks

905
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
The media hates them

906
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
I bet it's for the right raise

907
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,751
Pizzagate right before this

908
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,311
Cut it out cuz I don't really care to hear and why more about

909
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,847
Pizzagate on the podcast

910
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:19,295
He's like that you like to do all they do whatever they want to discredit me they're just pizzagate

911
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Because I suppose the fact

912
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:49,247
They don't show his full quote I know he's done this on the show already but they can't get you

913
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,831
Just to be like hey Alex they didn't show your full quote here's your full quote you dumb

914
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159

Completely fake

916
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:04,095

918
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,751

I'm just going to play that clip

927
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,327
Every time he brings up Sandy Hook

928
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
You might have had

929
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:43,519
Multiple times and adverbs adjectives supporting eggs

930
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311

00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,647
It down

935
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,743
Try really defensive about how they're all into truth

940
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Stephen Colbert

941
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,919
You got people to saying that he lost a chobanian court because

942
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,223
You made an embarrassing public retraction

943
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:30,111
You got people saying that he's a liar because he had to come out and say

944
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:45,471
Very in-depth talk about the pizza place but you have to go listen to them

945
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,031
You have to listen to Infowars

946
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
Of all of these Liars out there

947
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,663

Teleprompter Raiders

953

00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,263
What we're really doing

957
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,103
Listening to this and going well

958
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,407
I better double-check

959
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,223
You have done this to yourself

960
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,039
Eclipse

961
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,831
Sorry

962
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,135
Or what you cover

963
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
And they're f****** horrible

964
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,559
Where to start with one that we've already played on the show just

965
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
Just so you know

966
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
Give us a little bit of

967
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,215
Just familiar hatred discovers his homophobia

968
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Portion

969
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:01,503
Everywhere I went.

970
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
Suburb

971
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,135
I went into shock

972
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,463
Drown with the pool supply place

973
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:15,327
Starbucks

974
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
With a coffee

975
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,191
After school supplies

976
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,159
That are not tolerant that are the most oppressive

977
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Call wife

978
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,767
People on earth

979
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,815
You bet I'm freaked out

980
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,423
I got $3 lady Joan

981
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:56,799
So I wanted to start with just because we've already listened to before

982
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,103
What is afraid of young Muslim

983
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,663
Who are very integrated

984
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:07,807
I love that is so dumb on so many levels because that

985
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
Proved

986
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:14,463
What makes America better than Saudi Arabia is about

987
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
More like Saudi Arabia

988
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
Lobster in a pot

989
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,823
This is the cold water

990
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
So we've already

991
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,663
Just going to get worse from here

992
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,223
So this next clip is him

993
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Talking about Jade helm

994
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,879
Conspiracy theory that the government was going to take over Texas

995
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:49,279
This is him talking about it

996
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
Algorithm

997
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
Code

998
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:14,367
Special Forces to kill you

999
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,023
Special Forces families

1000
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:32,031
Serious disabilities

1001
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,103
Robots are going to be everywhere

1002
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Understand

1003
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,271
Are you talkin about cumin

1004
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:47,647
That's right directly on iRobot

1005
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,791
Cases for the past 20 years

1006
00:53:54,303 --> 00:54:00,447
So he really bought into Jade Helm and tried to scare people about it all the time

1007
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
Is already planning

1008
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,055
For future Guerrilla operations

1009
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,503
Is the water still not all that hot

1010
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
This is just you reporting dumb s***

1011
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,623
That was going on in

1012
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,415
2814 15

1013
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
Something like that Texas

1014
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Still free

1015
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,607
The Spurs lost so are any of us really

1016
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
Jason Howell did not

1017
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,751
But you're winning every basketball game

1018
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,615
Muslim hating America

1019
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,967
The next one I'm going to do here is

1020
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:47,807
But I'm going to call Whites Whites

1021
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,903
I was raised culture of white guilt

1022
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
Christians

1023
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,047
Across-the-board

1024
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,863
Crap

1025
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,687
That's crazy

1026
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,503
Black people have been abused

1027
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,831
By white people the same way he's been abused

1028
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,951
3 minute

1029
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,071
Unity is it street fights

1030
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
Why people are better than him apparel

1031
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:40,799
Structural abuse that has been ingrained in this country

1032
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
Pre-sentence beginning

1033
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,687
Nothing of the ideas

1034
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,735
Guilt people make me feel

1035
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
Refugee

1036
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
Four things that people that I am

1037
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,231
Probably directly related to your family fought for the South

1038
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,279
Why am I being

1039
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
Feel guilt over

1040
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,607
Fight for the South

1041
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
In the Civil War

1042
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,983
My dad got his Dentistry license

1043
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
From Robert E Lee

1044
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:19,199
The famous General he was authorized

1045
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,695
That's a whole lot in this next clip Alex misunderstands panhandling as being bugged

1046
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
Superfund

1047
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,167
I've been down there

1048
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,191
Buy a

1049
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,015
I don't say give it to me

1050
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
Almost always

1051
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:09,887
Because there's this attitude

1052
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:14,239
Call more white victimhood

1053
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
Alex

1054
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,943
That's a personal care what color Alex

1055
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:24,991
Is

1056
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
I think anybody who does what he does

1057
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,879
Deserves to have people asking for money every now and then

1058
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,559
If he always turns everything into like a scene from a movie

1059
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,143
The beginning here

1060
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,983
The more he lies the more details he gives

1061
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:53,919
Over 200

1062
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,503
Was homeless probably was

1063
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,575
Do you have any money yeah that's everything you've turned it into

1064
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,623
I'm being attacked by this guy

1065
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,071
Course cuz he's black

1066
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:16,191
I'm sick of his wife victimhood Supply

1067
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
A summer

1068
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
Yeah and it freaked

1069
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,055
Me

1070
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,919
Here's a nice fun clip of Paul Joseph Watson

1071
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:29,503
He did a report making fun of the idea of being trans

1072
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,599
Wards.com

1073
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:43,071

00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,863
You know what's really funny that put that special report

1077
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
Turn off

1078
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,727
Yeah

1079
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:28,639
You know I was getting just outwardly

1080
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,247
Throwing everything in everything

1081
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,783
A throne just every pause

1082
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
Possible thing that it's like

1083
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,647
Everybody who isn't a white male Christian

1084
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,975
Is the single worst thing in there trying to destroy everybody

1085
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
Louis

1086
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Which

1087
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Which frankly

1088
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,911
What what is the character doing wrong

1089
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,727
Characters just described

I would guess they were the character is doing wrong is it annoying Christian

1092
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,319
I don't want to feel

1093
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,159
This is really all about how he

1094
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
He doesn't want to feel

1095
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,511
You don't want to feel bad about being white

1096
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
Possibility

1097
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887

Flying about safe

1103
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Spaces in

1104
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Trigger word

1105
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,871

1108
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
Entirety

Feeling like that

01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,903
There's a lot of that

1114
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,207
Paul Joseph Watson

1115
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,535
Unexplained

1116
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
Forever

01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,423
But it has to do with more than just race

1120
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,983
Pretty bad

1121
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,359
Complete fabrication

1122
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,919
Completely bogus statistics

1123
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:12,319

01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:21,535
Exploring what you cover and so far

1126
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,327
Like everyone's right to hate you

1144
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,399
The parents of the kid that died

1145
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,847
I'm sure many of the parents of the young people that were at this concert my doorbells many were Tweenies when were team

1146
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,407
Probably there

1147
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,527
Do want to go along.

1148
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
Responsible for this animal

1149
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
Plus people

1150
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
Call fruit

1151
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
Hillary Clinton and Obama and all the rest of them

1152
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:39,103
You're the one

1153
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,151
That's the day after

1154
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
Nap

1155
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,855
Hey guys don't just take other people's roof find out why people

1156
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,999
Do that

1157
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,303
Do you remember how is angry before

1158
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
I want

1159
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
To not live

1160
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,143
Westworld

1161
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:05,471
This is what time

1162
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,567
People died

1163
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,871
Disrupted and this is

1164
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,943
F****** with the heads of everybody

1165
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,479
Because of course

1166
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
What else can

1167
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,527
Do you think butt

1168
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
Where's the next one

1169
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,671
Game with the heads-up so many people in Britain

1170
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,231
Because they're now they're in the middle of a

1171
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
F****** elec

1172
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,303
So this kind of nationalistic vulture

1173
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,095
It is only going to get stronger because

1174
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
Because of that dip

1175
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887
Any

1176
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
Something work

1177
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
You look at

1178
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
Set up saying

1179
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,287
I don't want any

1180
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,591
Don't want

1181
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
I don't

1182
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
Instead you look at that and say

1183
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
I want

1184
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,039
I want more people

1185
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
I want there

1186
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
2B War

1187
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
I want there

1188
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,903
Tube blockage

1189
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,695
I want anybody who's a refuge

1190
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
Eugene wants to come in here

1191
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,279
I want them to drown on their way

1192
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,095
And even if I want them to be pushed away

1193
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,375
I want more

1194
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,935
People that died because of this

1195
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,775
Believe in something

1196
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
So hard right

1197
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,359
And so evil that reminder

1198
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,895
Three of you f***

1199
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:20,223
Yeah longer I swear to God

1200
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,623
All the lights

1201
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
Yeah

1202
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,511
I don't even give a f***

1203
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,559
A goddamn terrorist walked

1204
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Through this book

1205
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,375
Endure because then at least be like

1206
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:41,215
Hey Will you're not trying to take away my goddamn Healthcare

1207
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,751
Dial f****** garbage

1208
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
Yeah you

1209
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,103
Believable

1210
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
One second

1211
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,967
Experienced a tiny bit of a

1212
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
None

1213
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
And

1214
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
You blame

1215
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,671
Parents once again grieving there

1216
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
F***************

1217
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,231
And Alex

1218
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
You fuc

1219
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
Pizza

1220
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,303
F*** you

1221
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,095
Totally wow

1222
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,679
Totally

1223
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,519
Who created more hurt that's just a societal element of this

1224
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,799
Like your Buda scribe

1225
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,591
Absolutely

1226
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,895
But on an even smaller scale

1227
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,967
But if you're one of those parents who do here and say something like that

1228
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,015
He specifically wants to hurt them

1229
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
And this is this

1230
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,343
Like this is worse than

1231
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Sandy Hook

1232
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,391
This is

1233
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:40,863
Hannity spouting words instead of delete vert you're not actively

1234
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:47,519
Blaming the parents for being the cause of their children is going to hide behind the idea

1235
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:53,407
Cowardly Dog

1236
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Now that's

1237
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,527
Bereavement

1238
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,343
You really want to break down what he's afraid of

1239
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,647
It's not a bomb

1240
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
Any of that stuff

1241
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,255
It has to do with his white identity

1242
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
That's what he's afraid of

1243
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,863
He's afraid of these people coming in who aren't like

1244
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,703
He's afraid of being victimized by people who aren't White

1245
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,359
Did you have no leg to stand on other than

1246
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
Did you read the transcript of the New Orlean

1247
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,503
I did not he gave a perfect

1248
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,063
Speech on how the monument

1249
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,647
Taking down Confederate monuments

1250
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,671
Through it all

1251
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,439
Acknowledge

1252
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
Start to finish

1253
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Just how those

1254
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
Replaced up there by

1255
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Trying

1256
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,095
To White

1257
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Endeavor

1258
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,679
Free time

1259
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
If you were black

1260
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
You were from a different country

1261
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,847
There is always that f***

1262
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
These monuments

1263
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
Represent

1264
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
How a

1265
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,247
Large part of this called

1266
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,623
Trying to make sure that

1267
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
We were in

1268
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Slate

1269
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
And he gave a perc

1270
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:17,119
Exactly what is beautiful about America is the the guy

1271
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,679
New Orleans is ever

1272
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,519
New Orleans is the truest Melting Pot

1273
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,799
That America has

1274
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,847
Yeah cuz that you can drink outside

1275
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
Everyone loves

1276
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,895
Yeah

1277
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,199
Well and the only reason is again

1278
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
The slave trade

1279
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,759
Because of

1280
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,551
Because everybody was there because

1281
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,575
His Creoles were there

1282
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
Because black people

1283
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,391
Because it.

1284
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,927
Huge

1285
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
Everybody

1286
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,511
That's how you create an awesome culture

1287
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Beautiful

1288
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
And that

1289
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
Is the thing that they hate

1290
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
It really is

1291
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,679
Because it's not

1292
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
Holy there's

1293
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,495
You have to share it

1294
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:00,895
That's the issue with Alex because sharing leads to socialism which leads to Communism

1295
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,967
Re-read

1296
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,759
Yeah

1297
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,575
So my message

1298
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Should be

1299
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
I mean I have a couple fold

1300
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,951
From this episode

1301
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
The first

1302
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,535
He's obviously don't tell people to actually listen to

1303
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
A show

1304
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,839
Because

1305
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,911
They will find out what you cover

1306
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,215
You could do find out what you cover in

1307
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
It's bad

1308
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,543
That's why we do this year

1309
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,335
What's secondarily

1310
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:34,431
What you need to do when you get press credentials

1311
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,247
Is just like tell people to suck

1312
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,039
Justglo

1313
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,087
You're supposed to be trolling people

1314
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
This isn't going to work

1315
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,159
You're not illegitimate news orca

1316
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Way too much baggage

1317
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
You can't report

1318
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,047
This call me things as zero

1319
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:55,935
All of y'all are lies and Hillary Clinton's no matter how much they

1320
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Narrative

1321
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
F*** them

1322
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,031
We're done

1323
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,823
Damn Hillary already lost

1324
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,895
You can't still be running a can

1325
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,919
Campaign against

1326
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,247
But you sold that uranium was Russia trying to

1327
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,271
To govern the f***

1328
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
Goddamn

1329
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,719
Sorry

1330
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
Sorry

1331
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:25,887
This is why we need the wind Dad look we'll figure it out will be better in the future

1332
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,055
I know that was a little a little much

1333
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,151
Can't

1334
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,431
I can't f****** deal with that

1335
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,479
How do you how do you listen to

1336
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
The truth

1337
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Towards

1338
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
True cruelty

1339
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
Like there's

1340
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
No a

1341
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
See it all there is

1342
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
Only

1343
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
Inflict more pain on

1344
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,703
Why and I want to shame them for their victimhood why would you want to

1345
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,007
There are victims

1346
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
Their literal victim

1347
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
You can't be mad that there

1348
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,407
Victims when they were Vic

1349
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,991
Victimized because hypothetically

1350
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
Specifically Peru

1351
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
I don't know

1352
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,903
Who cares who cares

1353
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:24,767
Why you're saying that's another very important piece

1354
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
Shut the guy who

1355
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
Like

1356
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
I can't think of any

1357
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,143
Anything other than

1358
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
The amount

1359
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Pain

1360
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,263
You just want

1361
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,543
Single other

1362
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
To Felix

1363
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
Exactly

1364
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
More panda

1365
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:46,271
He wants to experience the least amount of pain right

1366
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,623
Other people feel better by

1367
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
Ghetto doing good

1368
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,463
He has to feel better about making everybody else

1369
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:58,047
Look I don't know he sucks that's the bottom line

1370
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,863
Hope there's no way around it

1371
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,399
I wish I had more clips

1372
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:11,615
Okay so we're still figuring out exactly how this podcast is going to go without our old friend wine

1373
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,943
Arc legs

1374
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,479
We'll figure out a rhythm

1375
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
Without the libation

1376
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:25,695
But until then you can find us at knowledge fight.com anyone follow us on Twitter or at knowledge

1377
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
Underscore

1378
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,167
We will time travel to the Past

1379
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
Episode

1380
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:40,799
How about today

1381
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
Really f******

1382
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
And how here

1383
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,455
Explicitly said

1384
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
He wants to run a day

1385
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
Disinformation

1386
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,575
Bad about him

1387
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
Don't be mad because he's

1388
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
He's from Infowars

1389
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,743
That's bulshit on

1390
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,047
Cuz this man

1391
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,583
We Believe

1392
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,143
Is going to

1393
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,703
To be the best way to solve the problem

1394
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
This is

1395
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
Who's the guy who is

1396
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,567
Sweetly on interest

1397
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,895
False reality

1398
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,991
American

1399
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
Absolutely right I was talking about

1400
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,647
Interested in the truth and making sure no one knows

1401
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,951
Because

1402
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,975
Yeah exactly

1403
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
Secrets and secrets

1404
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Yeah

1405
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,583
Without without wine

1406
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:40,191
The mood is really f*** this guy

1407
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
To keep my temper

1408
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,175
I wasn't scared

1409
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:54,527
Spit flying from my goddamn list

1410
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,599
All over your beard Mike screen

1411
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,487
What what good news

1412
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,815
Who's that reports

1413
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,119
Holding

1414
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,751
Alex
