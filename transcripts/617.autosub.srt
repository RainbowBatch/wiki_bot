1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

4
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
Around and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Question for you

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
Yes what's up

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
What's your vibrates but today might be a controversial Brightspot Metro maybe one that people won't

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
Come on board

10
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,456
Okay and that is I'm excited

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
Hi-C

12
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,832
Didn't realize it until maybe like

13
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
A couple weeks ago but

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Iambic

15
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
Pump the Chicago winter is coming

16
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,048
You know like I didn't realize how much I enjoy it you like a winter

17
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,912
I know I say that and then it's going to be -20 like Irish music

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Is the nature of the Beast

19
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
Yeah but I don't think I could live in a place that didn't have a winter

20
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
I am it's kind of nice

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Rattata little bit of snow

22
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664
Yeah,

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
It's a it's a it's a nice thing to have the seasons change something for you without you having to like move

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Over something

25
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,416
Like I just all I did was just sitting here for a while and things are different

26
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,328
I think the feels like the leaves fell off the trees

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,168
Like within a matter of a couple days overnight

28
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:25,152
There's a nice sunny day and then about two 2 in the afternoon it's just like it's going to be winter forever now

29
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,992
0260 I guess in this case

30
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
Fall probably the best

31
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Sure but then

32
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
When is pretty good

33
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
As much as I love

34
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Benno the island

35
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
I don't know

36
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,120
I like fight my might miss winter had that the winner is I'm an indoor kid

37
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,472
I'm an indoor kid man you know I don't like to I don't like to be outside much anyways

38
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
It's super cold

39
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
Give me an excuse to get back inside that much quicker

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
That's true and if your indoor kid

41
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
I can just

42
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,760
Bring snowballs inside your house

43
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
My bright spot Dan is surprised it was not

44
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
You're right but as well but

45
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,096
We had a bit of a fun time watching wrestling with the want to go watch

46
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,984
Aew full gear pay-per-view

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,848

48
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:32,480
Jerk people are calling a hanging out these day was a goddamn

49
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,296
There's a fantastic time

50
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
I haven't been to their place in. You know it's just great

51
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
I am going to keep the my review of the paper

52
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Myself

53
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,912
Logan has not going to be a controversial

54
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Probably not

55
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,752
So Jordan today we're going back to the

56
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,592
Past about June 27th

57
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
2003

58
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
Okay on this this year episode

59
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,528
1 reasons for that was that last episode of the present-day

60
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
And I think I got it I got enough ass

61
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,976
Real dick

62
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Did the bean

63
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
Some things to learn on this

64
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
This year podcast

65
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
I wanted to take back

66
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,727
Then find some mediate stuff to go over and I did I found something

67
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Is it going to be really interesting

68
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
To get into some

69
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Perception

70
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
That'll be busted

71
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Maybe

72
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Weather perception

73
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,439
Mark Mack in Mayberry r.f.d.

78
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Strange aliases

79
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,951

80
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863

Then I got this person

86
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Thank God they included

87
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,391
A clarification that

88
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
Big habitat clarification literally Counting Crows rapper

89
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
And I really appreciate that

90
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,375
I don't know if I would have got that otherwise would have been interesting to see you read the entire thing without knowledge that it was

91
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Is lyrics

92
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Yeah that would be fun

93
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Technocrat

94
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Heroin

95
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Freakishly large

96
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,815
Jay-Z in Olympia it's not

97
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
2 letters

98
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
Is Jay-Z a

99
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
The Illuminati know not the difference

100
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,799
Sister Beyonce

101
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Do initials

102
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:45,503
We start off today's episode with some triumphant news for some

103
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,063
Castle possibly if he news for Alex

104
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
But he interprets

105
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
In a strange way

106
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Good morning hours yesterday

107
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
4

108
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
If you hate me

109
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
You're calmer

110
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Did you care about more

111
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
U.s. attack

112
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
Excuse me sir is text because he cared about black people

113
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,031
I think this is an interesting take on Strom Thurmond and why people would call him racist

114
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
Wow this is full of s***

115
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
Princeton's even in the information that Alex

116
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Provided in just back

117
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
I clip you might end up like if you

118
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
That's all you had to go on you might ask yourself

119
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,671
What did Strom Thurmond go from being a Democrat or Republican

120
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
It seems like something that maybe was a big decision for him I wonder if a lot of people at the same time

121
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
From being Democrats become Republicans short version is that strong was a huge racist in the Democratic party wasn't race

122
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,591
Enough for him anymore not anymore so the longer version is that in 1950

123
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Text many Southern Democrats or Dixie

124
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
Secrets as they were known after they went a little rogue and

125
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
In response to Harry S Truman sporting some civil rights

126
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
Hi in the 1948 election

127
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Dixiecrats were really pissed off about the Supreme Court

128
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
Decision in Brown versus

129
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Board of Education

130
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Which rule that racially segregated schools were

131
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Constitutional

132
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
In response

133
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
112 of the 138 members

134
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
Congress from Southern states signed what they called

135
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
The southern Manifesto

136
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
This document

137
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:19,615
Insisted that the Supreme Court had no right to meddle in the matters of Education

138
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
People of different

139
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Races had to go to separate

140
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
Protecting that right was critically important

141
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
States rights

142
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,367
Dan it's not it's about the federal system getting out of our business

143
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
To protect the Constitution

144
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Absolutely

145
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
They pleaded that they should be able to

146
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
To keep their whole separate-but-equal thing

147
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Then going and blamed efforts to

148
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
To desegregate on quote outside meddler

149
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
What I've never heard that

150
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
But they have been f****** up the

151
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Progressive Movement for so long effective

152
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,663
Overtime

153
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
Defeated outside Battlers they warned

154
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,319
Integrate schools was going to destroy the amicable relations between the races

155
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
Literally that's in the southern Manifesto

156
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Declared the intention to resist

157
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Forced integration by any lawful meme

158
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
So strong Thurmond as a southern member of the Senate was a massive fan of segregation

159
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,663
It was a losing battle he was fighting as the tide was

160
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,247
Trending toward civil rights

161
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
F****** hard

162
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
That brings us to August 28th 1950

163
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,439
B7 when Strom Thurmond embarked on the longest filibuster in history

164
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
Derail the Civil Rights Act of 1950

165
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
A large part of which have to do with protector

166
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Black people's right to

167
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Well there is that

168
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
You filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes

169
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
But the bill passed a couple hours after he ran out of space

170
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,151
YouTube essentially nothing except making sure people throughout history would remember him as a record-setting racist

171
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
Play forward a few gears in lb

172
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
BJ he just signed the Civil Rights Act

173
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Active 19-6

174
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Is it outlawed

175
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,159
Discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex and national origin

176
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:14,559
Discovered voting issues public accommodations public facilities education and employment discrimination

177
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,399
I'm so easily imagine the races were really not happy about thought they weren't

178
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
Stokes lbj's assistant Bill Moyers has quoted Johnson the saying quote I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for it

179
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Long time to come

180
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
After he signed the bill

181
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
And at the time he couldn't have possibly known how right

182
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
The cracks were there cents

183
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
The Truman Administration to embrace of civil rights

184
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
NFL BJ shape was the

185
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Just too much

186
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
The Republican Party would sooner

187
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,767
An attempt to win over white Southern voters by explicitly appealing to their races

188
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
This was essentially the point where the parties

189
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
Completely change their identities from what they were previously

190
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
How many of the Southern Democrats

191
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Became Republic

192
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,543
Are there still some races democrats for sure but a lot of the heart

193
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Corfo

194
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Looks like a guy who

195
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Would speak for 24 hours straight to try and stop like

196
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
Guaranteed

197
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
They just made their job

198
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
To the Republican Party

199
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Santa Baby

200
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
Not to put too fine a point on it but Strom Thurmond has essentially synonymous with race

201
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,743
Even though he did so often as time

202
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,839
I like a vote in favor of making a holiday in honor of Martin Luther King jr.

203
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,727
His legacy is impossible to separate from his horrible racism at a time when it really mattered a lot

204
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
The fact that Alex

205
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Can't even accept this

206
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
Very clear reality of History

207
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
Indication of how entrenched his own races

208
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Even in 2000

209
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
He's a little publicly less

210
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Angry about it

211
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
You know what what

212
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Wild about

213
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
The Strom Thurmond thingy

214
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
I remember in my

215
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
Freshman

216
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
I'd like

217
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
History class we were

218
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
You're talking about

219
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
The president pro tempore of the Senate being fourth in line

220
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
For becoming

221
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
President

222
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,215
And I was like who is who is that now and then

223
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,543
Well they usually just give it to the oldest senator

224
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,431
And it was Strom Thurmond at the time and and I was like that's really funny it's the oldest Saturday

225
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
And she just looked at me and she was like

226
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Yeah I wouldn't

227
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Like Strom Thurmond if I were you

228
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Do you know what your job should be

229
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,743
Hey Strom Thurmond was a giant racist who filibustered for over 24 hours

230
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,095
The end civil rights as we knew it it's a good it's a good thing

231
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Instead she was like

232
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
You know what don't work

233
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Let's just hope that

234
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
The top three stay in

235
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Stay in line

236
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,359
So Alex has a what about game

237
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
Play with Strom Thurmond

238
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,991
Come on man be racist because someone else was

239
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Really

240
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
His

241
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Tired

242
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
I got viralix I wouldn't want to get into a big

243
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
Discussion about this too cuz

244
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
The specifics and up

245
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Making this argue

246
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Fall Apart

247
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Sooner or later when you're defending

248
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,231
Strom Thurmond you're going to be the guy who says something and you go now I didn't mean that in a races

249
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,607
Thurman segregationist views were not just in 1957

250
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,471
They're all so well after that point like when he left the Democratic party because they were too against segregation

251
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
A taste

252
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
Alex does make a good point about Senator Burr

253
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
I will admit that

254
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
That was also a piece of s*** and was deaf

255
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Muttley in the clan

256
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
There's no real evidence that he was involved

257
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
Mcclam passed around like 19

258
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
50 though

259
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
AliExpress the great deal of regret

260
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
About being a member later on

261
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,207
In the name of fairness though I don't think it's right of me

262
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
To say that it's cool to look at bird differently because he

263
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
You changed later in his life

264
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
When I'm still sticking at the Strom Thurmond even though

265
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
He did change a little bit as time went on as well

266
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,263
I have a perfect solution to this problem though and that is to say f*** both of them

267
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
You got it yeah

268
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,615
Now the only reason I'm really getting into this at all is be

269
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Because

270
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
There's a

271
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
Perfect example that Alec

272
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Looks good use to make this same argument

273
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Hunt better

274
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
But he doesn't

275
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Which is strange

276
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
Alex

277
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Instead of bringing up bird

278
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
You should be bringing up George Wallace

279
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
Considering that he was a hardcore segregationist

280
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Has he famously said segregation now said

281
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Aggregation tomorrow segregation forever

282
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
What was what

283
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,447
Antique races and he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination

284
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Turn all the way up

285
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
The 1976

286
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
There's a reason

287
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
Examples of racist in the Democratic Party

288
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
I'm at because he has to believe that George Wallace season 2 racist

289
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
Or else his entire world you suddenly starts to look really racist

290
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
There's a huge problem that he was a candidate that the John Birch Society was most into and that alone to make

291
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
Alex not want associated with a

292
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
Very clear racism in body

293
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,375
Then there's the other question that is disassociation would bring up

294
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Which is at the book

295
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
6 credits with changing his life

296
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Is none dare call Atkins

297
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
A sea which was written by Gary Allan

298
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
If not

299
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
The most popular writers in

300
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
Speakers of the John Birch Society

301
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
It was also George Wallace's speechwriter

302
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,807
Honestly Island was his speech writer on the presidential campaign

303
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
The first of which launched in nineteen

304
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
MP3

305
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
The same year

306
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
He said his famous quote about segregation forever

307
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
It's not impossible that Island had some hand in those words

308
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,631
Then you have the issue that one of the big backers of Wallace

309
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
1968 Independent party run

310
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
A president was Willis carto

311
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,055
The white supremacists and neo-nazis who founded the Liberty Lobby

312
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Hip-hop was the spotlight

313
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
Baby holocaust-denying publication that was edited by Alex

314
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Friend Big Jim Tucker

315
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
Who is Alex's MainSource on Bilderberg Inspira

316
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,367
When you pull on George Wallace unravel in Waze

317
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
How to make it to clear that out

318
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
World and his formative influences are all profound racing

319
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,815
That's why even though George Wallace will be perfect

320
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
Example to demonstrate Democratic racism at the time

321
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Strom Thurmond

322
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
In civil rights.

323
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Alex wouldn't go with

324
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Bird who has the

325
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,335
Is a decidedly racist past but no real indication of that Clan Association

326
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
I'm continuing into the p

327
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
. we're talking about

328
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
The out can't afford

329
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,015
To use the perfect example short

330
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
I find that really interesting

331
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
That is Irene

332
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
Cuz I was sitting there listening like

333
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,023
Don't you use Walla Walla

334
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Instantly the moment

335
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,399
You say Strom Thurmond I'm like yeah it is good buddy George Wallace

336
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
That's the way

337
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
It works

338
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Add for him to just have

339
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
To sit there and be like

340
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
Who can I find

341
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
Alex doesn't like a lot of these

342
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
People in the Republican party at this

343
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Molly's neocon

344
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Are all secretly liberal

345
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
They only want segregation a little bit

346
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
George W bush

347
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Trent Lott

348
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Orion Alex

349
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Is crosshairs

350
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
For the wrong reasons

351
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
That's not your fault

352
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
Cheerleader

353
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Cheerleader

354
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Cheerleader

355
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
New World Order

356
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Wow

357
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
So I guess if your male cheerleader you getting

358
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
I am

359
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Boggle

360
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,679
Why

361
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,775
If that is what you would expect but it's like I'm above all things

362
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:57,151
Yep that's all things going on right now man must

363
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
Adhere to the strict

364
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,039
Rules and roles that I have delineator for them because they're

365
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,879
Divinely-inspired or something

366
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
It's like you don't even know anything about male cheerleading at the time

367
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,071
There's a massive competitive cheerleading shoot going on in the male cheerleaders

368
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
Incredibly important

369
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,775
Building building a base stand on

370
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:29,919
I need to create another version of V like you can't trust a male nurse

371
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
I totally

372
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
These things are fun

373
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
Excuse me

374
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Stewardess

375
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
No sir

376
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,903
Sir sir I know you're a man but

377
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
If you're doing this

378
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
Job

379
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Ridiculous

380
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Publix

381
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
Alex

382
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,399
Augusta on the show that somebody that I have not heard on his show before

383
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Character by the name of John Andrews

384
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
I was at the point

385
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,055
Who's the president of the Colorado State Senate

386
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
4

387
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,223
Controls on what identification

388
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
People could use

389
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,807
Things like the Consular

390
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Dracula cards

391
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,439
Like the Mexican consulate give out these identification cards

392
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
Let's do Mexican Nationals living in the United States

393
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
And he's mad about the

394
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
And so we're going to talk about it a little bit

395
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Listen to

396
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
Hey knock it off

397
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Settings

398
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Empowering fellow

399
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,952
Call I mean that's just so you know undocumented immigrants

400
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,072
Photo IDs at the Met

401
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
Can consulate can issue to Mexican

402
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Animals living outside of neck

403
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,240
These are very helpful particularly for Mexican immigrants living in the night

404
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Red States for a number of reasons

405
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,616
The first is that they allow consulates to be able to track and locate people much

406
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Easier than they would be able to otherwise in

407
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
In the case of like an emerging

408
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,040
The second reason is that they are considered valid ID by many states

409
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Special and immigrants have any

410
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Imitation status

411
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Best to apply for a driver's license

412
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
And

413
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
It allows them to pay taxes

414
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
Further sent to the matricula card

415
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Is a valid ID they allow folks

416
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
The ability to open

417
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
George's

418
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
A pretty important

419
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
1 things they

420
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
I don't do is confirm

421
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Any sort of immigration

422
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
Status upon the holder of one of these cards

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
It's just a secure official

424
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Difficult to forge form of identification

425
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Who makes everyone's life easier

426
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
If you guys are super gay

427
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
So essentially

428
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
Because States and America won't

429
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Give people ideas without

430
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Having already

431
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Got photo IDs or whatever

432
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
This has to

433
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,632
Has Mexico and their take Hannah

434
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
Being able to

435
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
Know where citizens

436
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
Mexico

437
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,664
Society then-president of the Colorado senate about a bill he was champ

438
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,992
Call the Colorado house bill 1224

439
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,040
The secure and verifiable identity

440
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
This act wasn't designed to have the Mexican consulate

441
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Stop issuing these

442
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,976
These cards because that would have been a violation of the 19th

443
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
63 Vienna convention on Consular relations

444
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,632
Instead This Act was aimed at making it so stain Local H

445
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
In season Colorado could quote

446
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Only accepts

447
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
Secure and verifiable document

448
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Which event was

449
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Defined as not being these things

450
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,480
This was essentially Just a Bill designed to make immigrants lives more difficult by doing things like making it so people who

451
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
Have Consular ID cards

452
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
Can't use them to get drivers license at a bank

453
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,952
Folks like Andrews often try to catch their motivations as being about keeping people safe and making

454
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
I'm sure the people can't exploit the system

455
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,864
But the reality is that this kind of bulshit hurts a lot more people than just on documented immigrant

456
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,936
It'll be really naive to imagine that Andrews isn't aware of that

457
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,544
In 2006 a report released by The Brennan Center for justice title.

458
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Citizens without proof

459
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Which is aimed at analyzing the effect

460
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
These restrictions on getting identification

461
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Navigation have

462
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
Or have the potential to have

463
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
On US cities

464
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Themselves

465
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,392
They found that 7% of US citizens do not have ready access to the document

466
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
That's that would be required

467
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Where to get a driver's

468
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Under these new laws

469
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,328
But I just don't have the documents to

470
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,912
However this number actually goes up to twelve percent

471
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:11,264
When you only include people who make under $25,000 a year

472
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:16,384
Additionally 34% of women of voting age had a document they prove their citizenship

473
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
But it was

474
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
Something that included there

475
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
Current legal name

476
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:25,344
Oh yeah well these are like real difficulties that people who

477
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,416
Citizens would have under these restrictions

478
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
On the sake of

479
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Essential

480
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Racism

481
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,120
Wolves control

482
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
What they consider like

483
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Trespass

484
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
Yeah if you if you if you

485
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
If You Can't Ban

486
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
People

487
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Then you can just

488
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Make their lives

489
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
Miserable enough

490
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
That they want one of

491
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
That's

492
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
The other

493
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,296
Just let you know what kind of a s******* this guy John Andrews is

494
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Summer

495
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,648
Excerpt from a speech he gave at the 2019 Western

496
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Conservative Summit

497
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
The theme of this Gathering was

498
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,024
Defending religious freedom and America's First Amendment

499
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,120
Segregation now segregation then maybe

500
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Asian forever

501
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,984
So he begins by extolling how great and important religious freedom is

502
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:20,896
Unless every American is free to honor God as conscience may God and obey God in the Public Square as long

503
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Is no one else is armed

504
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,992
Unless we are free and that precious way we are not

505
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Free at all

506
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
So far so good

507
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,440
As long as he's talking about all religious beliefs and also the absence of religious belief I can go live with him

508
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
Absolutely. You lose me pretty fat okay

509
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Preserve the Conte

510
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,216
Now let's talk about what freedom of religion does not

511
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
All right I will speak with tough love

512
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
From the heart

513
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
With no animosity or ill-will toward any person

514
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,664
Let me please hear me carefully

515
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,272
Who's somebody originated the belief system they claimed exclusive right to revelation

516
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
The command from above

517
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,672
Harness that aggressive claim to a burning sense of victimization

518
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
The wound from within

519
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
What Loose Cannon that would be

520
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,864
Suppose its claim of Revelation included a totalitarian political and economic

521
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
I'm not subject to Reformation

522
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,728
Set forth in a holy book not subject to revision

523
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,616
Suppose it's legal Scholars and clergy insisted the day is coming when that book must govern all mankind

524
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
On penalty of death

525
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
After whoever would refuse to submit

526
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,552
Suppose finally the biz belief system have been around for over a thousand years deepening its evict

527
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Complex

528
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,440
Reinforcing its unbending absolutism in its dreams of global Conquest

529
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Until today commands the allegiance of a

530
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Quarter of the Earth's population

531
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
On every part of the Earth's surface

532
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,656
I'm talking about the belief system called Islam

533
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Speed now what

534
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
So odd about that

535
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Well

536
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,360
Hello to get mad I was worried that he was a radical islamist

537
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
Exact

538
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,664
Same thing about

539
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
That's so weird

540
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:05,856
Islam isn't protected by the freedom of religion in 2019

541
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
He goes on to clarify a statement by saying

542
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,280
It's true we all know Muslims were likeable neighbors or capable coworkers

543
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
Decent patriotic American to humbly love Allah

544
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
That's not what I'm talkin

545
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Think about what

546
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:24,544
But that's absolutely what he's talking about

547
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,360
Horribly murder is totalitarian victimhood obsessed

548
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
Cold that includes a quarter of the world's population

549
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,272
Cute including in that plurvy nice Muslim neighbors he's pretending to not be talk

550
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
About

551
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
This is abject demonization

552
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Of all Muslim

553
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
Pretending to be an opposition to Terror

554
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,000
Just a few paragraphs after he says that he's not talking about the nice Muslim Neighbors

555
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
He literally says

556
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Quote

557
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Simplistic approach of

558
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,400
Just granting unconstitutional quote on quote freedom of religion

559
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,496
Religion that doesn't believe in Freedom and have no doubt Islam does not

560
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
That approaches civilizational suicide

561
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Wow

562
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
MSP she goes on to say quote

563
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
I'm sure some of you will disagree with me

564
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
So will some other speakers this weekend

565
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,624
They will tell you that a good and faithful Muslim can also be a good and faithful American

566
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Sorry

567
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
I don't see

568
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
See how

569
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,768
Wow that's on you yeah

570
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,376
No problem easy that's an easy fix yourself

571
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,984
He goes on to say that Americans name their two enemies who are marks and Bahama

572
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,312
Oh man it sure seems like it

573
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Just that

574
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
Ever suck

575
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
2003 is apart of the Colorado senator

576
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Intense hatred of Islam

577
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
He's a

578
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,904
Xenophobic assholes reviews America as a white Christian country

579
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
Denny's dedicated

580
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Pursuing pilot

581
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Let's support that view

582
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,536
The only thing I'm left in confusion about

583
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
Like when I look into this guy's leg why is he not

584
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,448
Still a regular guest Infowars

585
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
Is is he still elected to anything

586
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Well

587
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
Then he should be

588
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,688
So I I I find this guy to be certified

589
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:12,064
Boring racist he's a real piece of s*** he's a real piece of s*** I don't like that

590
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
You can just

591
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Still say things

592
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
16 years after that

593
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:20,256
You know like it you should Ned like 16 years of the longtime for the world tonight

594
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Change

595
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
That's brutal

596
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Yeah

597
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
1/2

598
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Susan about bashing

599
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
Usher and then

600
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,592
He goes on to cite somebody that it's

601
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Almost

602
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Amazing

603
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
But he would say

604
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Starbucks

605
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Mexican

606
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,736
It's about the rule of law and weather

607
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
U.s. tax

608
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Sovereignty

609
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Seriously

610
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
At the Congressional hearing

611
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
From Iowa of all play

612
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
Iowa long long way from

613
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
Border

614
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Congressman

615
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Steve king of Iowa

616
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Fold-up going

617
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
School principal in

618
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
Suburban Des Moines

619
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Spanish guy

620
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Decatur

621
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
Find an ad

622
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
Immigration

623
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
In Kingston

624
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Your problem

625
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
America

626
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
Educator someone

627
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Start the molding

628
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Good luck brother

629
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
You didn't cross

630
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,648
The border the Border cross.

631
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Brenda Pratt

632
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
Getting this corner

633
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Country backing

634
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
We want to thank you

635
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Bring it back

636
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Actually improved

637
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Condition

638
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
Which we lost

639
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
Pretty pretty amazing story

640
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,472
Are you telling me that

641
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Noted

642
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
Massive racing

643
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Steve King

644
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
You're from Iowa

645
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,128
Spoke to a very real person

646
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Who told him

647
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Always taking Iowa back

648
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:51,648
Do you understand that correctly I heard that was like wow that's not a true story

649
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
Totally true story

650
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
I love I love it's really fake

651
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,024
Story that Steve King told

652
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120
Is now being repeated this Colorado state senator to Alex

653
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
To defend his race

654
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
Political ideas

655
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,496
This incredible racist made up a very racist

656
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
Story that I am going to

657
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,104
Share with you to defend myself and say that I am not a race

658
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,176
Still there were no there was no rush

659
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
Teacher who told Steve King Theory colonizing

660
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,832
The country that they appreciated that America had made some improvements to the place in the meantime

661
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
I love it

662
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
That's just a story that

663
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
TaylorMade

664
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
The push the button

665
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,232
White identity victimhood fetishize

666
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
A & H

667
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,120
There's so much subtle and unspoken racism the built into that story

668
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
Quite awhile zanpakuto but

669
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
I think there's a couple of point

670
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
What's the jump out

671
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
As the most

672
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Interesting

673
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,128
The first is that the story is meant to evoke the feeling of someone taking advantage of the hard work that you've done

674
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
These supposed Mexico

675
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
Kinfolks we're going to take

676
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Country overall

677
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Exploit

678
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,528
The fruits of our hard labor

679
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:57,440
This is a particular fear for white nationalists because on some level they're aware that this is exactly what the United States another way

680
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
Western countries colonialism

681
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,048
And that without the exploitation of other populations

682
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Internet resources

683
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,632
The affluence that they enjoy today

684
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
There's an unspoken admission of we have

685
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:13,824
Being all freaked out about some terrifying foreign group coming to enjoy that affluent Sonora

686
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
Spent that's on some level and expression of guilt

687
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,712
These folks will never really processor be in touch with

688
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Which they should probably get

689
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Get some therapy

690
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,832
The second thing is really f***** up about this fake

691
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
Story that Andrews is relating

692
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Has to do with the characterization of this fictional Hispanic guy

693
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:35,840
He's telling Steve King that he's part of this effort to colonize Demoine and the rest of the United States

694
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
And you'll notice that a

695
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Specifically points out that

696
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
Is presumably a legal resident

697
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
The United States

698
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
This isn't explicitly laid out in the story but this is

699
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,896
Details that exist in the telling to make the audience afraid of all immigrants

700
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,200
Even if they're here illegally and fully.

701
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,504
It's the same mentality

702
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
That exist

703
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,648
In his 2019 comments about you can't be a faithful Muslim and a faithful America

704
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
Targeting and demonizing the entire group

705
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
Yep all pretending that's not what you're doing

706
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,304
Absolutely ND idea.

707
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
At subtle like

708
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,656
Just saying presumably he's a US citizen

709
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Is

710
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Is a

711
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Simple way

712
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Saying

713
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,544
You can't tell if they're US citizens are looking

714
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,128
Even if they are maybe they're not

715
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,224
Locked up

716
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,576
They might be on document everybody could be an illegal aliens are just

717
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
Based on your site

718
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
Go ahead and assume

719
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Yeah

720
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,720
This is how someone like Steve king or John Andrews camp

721
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
Pretend that their politics and beliefs are about Nash

722
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,352
No security or the rule of law but the actual message they're putting forth

723
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Is one of white nationalism and xenophobia

724
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:49,312
Just because a Hispanic guy that Steve King made up is here legally that doesn't mean that he's not also part of an effort to recall

725
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Colonized

726
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
States

727
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Black

728
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,688
Also it's really hilarious that the example Andrews when

729
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
With immediately if somebody who's like

730
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
An expert on these things

731
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Steve King

732
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,184
Someone who's synonymous with white nationalism and racism in the same way that Strom Thurmond

733
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,256
Another generation

734
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
To another level

735
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
Yeah I think this says it all

736
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,632
NPR

737
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
When Steve King lost his re-election bid in

738
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
2020

739
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
Headlines a little generous

Steve King known for racist comments loses re-election bid

742
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
I think that's generous

743
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
That might be generous

744
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,344
I would even I would have even gone so far as to challenge him back that Marie Le Pen kind

745
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
Hey

746
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Steve King

747
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
Massive racist

748
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
Lose his re-election bid

749
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Suez

750
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,328
Yeah you don't want to get bogged down though it's a hassle

751
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
Call you racist

752
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
This initiative

753
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
That John Andrews is putting

754
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
4th and that is this

755
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,080
Idea that you don't want places to

756
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Except these matricula cards

757
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
As accepted

758
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Four forms of identification

759
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,248
Sure because then you can make it so they can't use them

760
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
To get a state ID

761
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
Her driver's license

762
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,648
Immigration

00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Status

764
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
Even if you get the driver's license

765
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
It doesn't mean

766
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
Haha you're now

767
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,096
Secretly a magic via citizen understand but you want

768
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,424
Every every official Place do not recognize this

769
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,264
And Alex has a really f***** up way that he talks about how like

770
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
All the states need to get on board

771
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
I do hope people visit

772
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
Colorado center.com and learn more about

773
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Their states

774
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
We're increasing the US Congress

775
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Wow

776
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,352
It's really interesting as a thing for Alex to be saying because it absolutely contradict

777
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
Literally everything he believes about the balance

778
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
Between Liberty and security

779
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,032
He constantly rails on things like the Patriot Act

780
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Is biggest

781
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
And fairly defensive

782
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,664
Problems with it is that it was sold to the American people using fear

783
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
The idea was that if the folks

784
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
National Security

785
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
Expand their abilities

786
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,320
Operate there by encroaching on people's Liberty

787
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
And that would make the next terrorist attack more likely

788
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Because National

789
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
Security could have stopped it

790
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,256
If it just been able to use these expanded ability

791
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:26,240
If I took Alex seriously about his beliefs meant anything to him I would say that this was really strange and hypocritical way for him

792
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
Support has a bill

793
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,312
Against accepting Consular ID

794
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,176
Because I know about as much about him as I do I know that this really isn't the contradiction

795
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:40,576
Because in his mind the Patriot Act people so it's bad glasby Colorado bill is designed to Target

796
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Satisfying

797
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,720
This is not a small point and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that

798
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,536
These state-level pushes to use the fear of terrorism

799
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
To restrict various forms of ID

800
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
From being acceptable

801
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:57,984
That was the beginning of a trend that would come to a head when Congress enacted Public Law 109

802
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
13th in May 2000

803
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
M5

804
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
This was a part of the quote

805
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Emergent

806
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
Supplemental Appropriations Act

807
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
For defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief

808
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,856
Page 82 of the bell in division B title to section 202

809
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,696
New standards were laid out for what documents are necessary for States

810
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
To determine a person's identity

811
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
For any official Purp

812
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,328
Including issuing IDs or driver's license

813
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,352
A naturally

814
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
Mchire

815
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,728
And states were required to adhere to a federal minimum requirements

816
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
In terms of what they consider to provide an

817
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
Predictably

818
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
Alex and his weirdo friends were all up in arms.

819
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
The Furious about the real ID act because

820
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
It affects the only group that matters to them

821
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
People who look like them

822
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
They tend to forget

823
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
That the precursor to these evil ID laws was their own agitating against

824
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,952
Accepting things I Consular ID

825
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
As acceptable forms of identification

826
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:57,120
And at the same arguments in stoking fears of imaginary Mexicans trying to recolonize

827
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,680
Or terrorist hiding an immigrant communities that they used

828
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
To pursue their goals

829
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
We used to push the real ID Act

830
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,080
John Andrew saying like we're pushing Congress

831
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,896
Got to take action on this on the federal level

832
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,224
The thing that is most annoying about Republicans concert

833
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Italy hoisting themselves upon their own

834
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,856
Is it they have to Hoist the rest of us on it with

835
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,208
You can see that this is one of the really great examples

836
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
That's really clear about how Alex

837
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Coming and going

838
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
Yep.

839
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,120
Create a problem and then also profit off

840
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,680
Complaining about that problem being created

841
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
How to get

842
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
Plastic created at all mean

843
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,776
Single-handedly

844
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
I guess you can make the argument that Alex will be fine with these real IDs as long as they

845
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
They were run by the

846
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
State of the post of the federal government

847
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,064
And that may seem like a good appointed first but it's not

848
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
The first reason is that if the ark

849
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,696
Is that you need more restrictive rules about identification because if

850
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,744
If you don't thoroughly terrorist attacks or Mexico

851
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
Things are going to recolonize the country

852
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,584
That's not a state-level issue

853
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,680
If just one state has superlaks standard for identification

854
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
Then there wouldn't be any

855
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
Stopping these imaginary terrorist

856
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,776
I'm going to that state

857
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:12,896
Using the Consular ID to get driver's license which would then be recognized by all the states

858
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
Implemented these restrictive ID guidelines

859
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,272
Man that seems so obvious it's

860
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
It's like let's say that they like you handled

861
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
Gun laws at like a state level

862
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,232
Enter some states had really strict gun laws in other states that really Lacks

863
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Gun laws

864
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Like say

865
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,608
You were Illinois right you're living in Chicago and then just

866
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
Just like a mirror

867
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
Mirror miles away

868
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,728
There's the gun laws were very very Lacks

869
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
You know it

870
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
That wouldn't cause trouble

871
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,104
I'll be totally fine

872
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,248
I think I think there are many things that are appropriate to be run state-by-state

873
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
And then there are other things

874
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,856
That are larger issues that affect everybody

875
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:58,720
And those things kind of need to have universally applied policies or else they're useless

876
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:03,328
I am stopping terrorism is one of them but that's the argument you're going to use

877
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,936
Or the recolonization

878
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
You don't want you don't want Mexico take an Iowa anytime soon then they're going to vote first in our primaries and that's

879
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Going to be terrible

880
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,456
Yeah it's so this federal-state distinction that Alex abusive just doesn't

881
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Makes sense in this context

882
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
And the second reason

883
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
This isn't really a case

884
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Where that like

885
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,368
State federal issue thing

886
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
Is it

887
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,768
Reply cuz the federal government wouldn't be taking away of the process of issuing the ID

888
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
If that's still the state

889
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
There will just be a new more restrict

890
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,912
The minimum standard that states needed to follow

891
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
That was on a federal level

892
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,776
So Alex has John Andrews

893
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
But he sucks

894
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,360
Another Gaston blue guess what he also

895
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:53,248
Interesting

896
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
More

897
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,472
So just to be clear Alex hasn't demonstrated in any way that it's easy to get most

898
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
Consular IDs

899
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
Has he proven that undocumented immigrants get more government

900
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
Assistance nor that they have more rights

901
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Then citizens

902
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
All evidence

903
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Switch points

904
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Do the exact opposite

905
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,552
In every facet

906
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Only his

907
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
Extreme White

908
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Victim complex

909
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Next weekend

910
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:35,488
I don't love that Glenn Spencer is Alex's other guests episode

911
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:40,864
Whole thing might as well just be one long attack on immigrants particularly those from Mexico that's right

912
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,728
We talked about Spencer in the past but it's been awhile so let me refresh your memory a little bit

913
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,384
He's that total a****** who founded a group called The American Border Patrol who essentially pretended to be law enforcement Garden

914
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
Border Iraq

915
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,039
This was really the Vanguard of this type of activity since Glenn was doing that s*** back in the early 2000

916
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:04,415
Flash-forward to 2019 any of militia members deputizing themselves to guard the Border

917
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
In actually detaining immigrants

918
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,559
Larry Hopkins was arrested for being a felon in possession of a gun which

919
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
You should have been arrests

920
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Before long

921
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
It's a 27

922
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
17

923
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
It was in 2019

924
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,239
Law enforcement just let him go over those

925
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
. of time

926
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,663
The ended up becoming the leader of a group called The United constitutional Patriots who engaged in a whole lot of kidnapping

927
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,967
Unlawful detainer

928
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
He was a good boy you got to let him out what do get ahold of my Bailey's a good boy get him out there

929
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
Straight

930
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,951
Inspired in no small part by Trump and Tucker and Alex

931
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
Wisconsin fear-mongering about the Immigrant Caravan

932
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Set to blow up the southern border

933
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:47,167
Also his group's former spokesman James Benzie left the ucpn

934
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,727
Start his own border militia called The Guardian Patriots

935
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
He was arrested inside the prison

936
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,591
For 21 months on two counts of impersonating a border patrol

937
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
Anyway the point is in the front

938
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,247
In the present day we have a lot of right-wing xenophobic

939
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,831
S******* to think they're entitled to cosplay as law enforcement cuz they're white

940
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,415
Glenn Spencer was one of the leaders in that world and probably a hero

941
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
To all the Dum Dums

942
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
Out there today

943
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
Glenn is also one of the main proponent

944
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,351
Flam conspiracy theory which

945
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,215
This is essentially the belief that Mexican immigration is an explicit

946
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
The plan to take back over these Southwest

947
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
Splc quotes

948
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,871
Spencer from a 2000 rally

949
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
The dream of conquering asplundh

950
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
Lies deep in the heart of the Mexican

951
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Can psychic

952
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
This explains why some are willing to risk

953
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,087
Death their goal is more than job

954
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Conquest

955
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
They believe what they're doing

956
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Is Noble

957
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
They're defined

958
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,743
The Gringo to take back what is rightfully Mexico

959
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,559
To which every Mexican in the world replied

960
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,119
What the f*** are you talkin about

961
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
If you believe what Spencer promotes

962
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:57,567
It's really hard to see how you could be so against illegal immigration for this reason but somehow totally cool with legal hemp

963
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Immigration

964
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,871
It seems like just sloppily

965
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
The sky is white

966
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,199
Nationalism

967
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,039
Migrate illegally then they'll take back their country but if they migrate legally

968
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Then they won't

969
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,879
Take back their country

970
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
He's make it easier for them to migrate League

971
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
Your argument

972
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,607
He said if they migrate legally they won't take over the country that's an interesting argument I'd like to see what you would have to say today

973
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
That we should just keep them all

974
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:27,263
Also it should be sad that Glenn Spencer was also a fervent anti-semite

975
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,103
In 2008 he posted an article on his blog titled quote

976
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Speaking the Unspeakable

977
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Is G

978
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,247
Who's controlled Hollywood brainwashing Americans

979
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,039
Speaking the Unspeakable

980
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,879
Yet has been spoken for thousands of years

981
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
The Unspeakable

982
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,231
Repeat it Non-Stop

983
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,375
Is an article he argues that liberal Jews who control Hollywood or trying to insert pro-immigrant propaganda

984
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,471
And everything they release so is too I guess make America less white

985
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,287
I think that's a

986
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
And it wasn't

987
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
I'm smoking it anytime before then ever

988
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:11,039
It's at the end of the article he includes a link to an essay titled understanding Jewish influence

989
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
By Kevin McDonald

990
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,367
McDonald is essentially a Neo-Nazi

991
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:19,231
And if not that he's at least the academic who most neo-nazis point to in order to

992
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Defense attorney or not

993
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
Honorary neo-Nazi

994
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,143
Splc article about McDonald in the three books

995
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
She wrote about Jewish people

996
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Quote

997
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,007
McDonald's basic premises that Jews engaging

998
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Group evolutionary strategy

999
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335
It serves to enhance their ability

1000
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
The out compete non-jews for resources

1001
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,759
Although normally a tiny minority in their host countries Jews Like viruses

1002
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
Is destabilize their host societies to their own benefit

1003
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
McDonald's

1004
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
Because this Jewish

1005
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,743
Group behavior is said to have produced much Financial in intellectual success over the years

1006
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,095
McDonald's claims it has also produced understandable hatred

1007
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Tiles

1008
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,959
That means that anti-Semitism rather than being an irrational hatred

1009
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,543
Produced is actually a logical reaction to Jewish success

1010
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:10,943
Another word for Nazis like many other anti-semites were only anti-semitic because they were countering a genuine

1011
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
Who is threat to their well-being it's not their fault

1012
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,415
Spencer LinkedIn McDonald's essay in this post is what you might call

1013
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
A towel

1014
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,279
Who's against immigration but he also believes that the Jews are the ones

1015
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
I'm trying to bring an immigrant somehow is in

1016
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
An attack on the country and produce

1017
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:35,519
Pro-immigrant propaganda Hollywood all this sounds right

1018
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:40,383
I have many Jewish friends and they have been extremely instrumental in fighting illegal immigration

1019
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:46,527
I fear however that this small handful of patriotic Americans are far outnumbered by liberal Jews

1020
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,831
Uno have total control over our media

1021
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
While

1022
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:55,231
Who was the precursor to the modern militia dum-dum

1023
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
Patrolling the Border

1024
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,071
Is one of Alex's favorite guest

1025
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,911
Hey it's always nice to go back and see what the pass

1026
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,543
What's a non surprise

1027
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,639
How it said there's a narrative satisfaction even if there's not an emotion

1028
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
No Satisfaction

1029
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Wow

1030
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,271
So Alex

1031
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,599
Doesn't talk much about Iraq

1032
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
The war

1033
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
You still again

1034
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,279
He believes that there aren't weapons of mass destruction which good on him

1035
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,327
But he does have some interest

1036
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
Takes

1037
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:37,471
Okay that I enjoyed and I I looked at you a little bit

1038
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Alright

1039
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Thousand

1040
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:32,255
Gold bar gold bars so real quick that question about Tariq Aziz I can answer that very easily share

1041
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,839
He was actually also not the foreign minister at this point that was a

1042
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,655
Position he held from 1983 to 1991

1043
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,495
At the time of the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq

1044
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
Yeah it's pretty important

1045
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,847
Episode 27

1046
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
2003 and Alex's ass

1047
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:53,503
Where is Tariq Aziz as if to imply that he's somewhere enjoying his life or whatever

1048
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:59,391
He was captured on April 24th 2003 and held in Camp Cropper

1049
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
Bring back that sure

1050
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,463
Remain in custody until June

1051
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
2000

1052
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
15 when he died of a heart attack

1053
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:08,863
Alex is super wrong about this one after the heart attack

1054
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
Iraqi Republican guard has made off of gold bars a bunch of times I just kind of ignored it cuz it cuz it's too

1055
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,895
This time I wanted to dig in and see where if I can figure out where this idea came

1056
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
I think I

1057
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
Okay

1058
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,527
Apparently in 2003 some US soldiers in Iraq detained

1059
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
3 people that they stopped

1060
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,623
In the car that they felt might have been heading towards the Irani and border

1061
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
Their probable cause to search them was the quote

1062
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,743
The drivers paperwork and ID didn't match the

1063
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
Vehicle registration

1064
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,375
In the bed of the truck that soldiers found 999 bars of quote

1065
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,935
Crudely made non minted gold bars

1066
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,287
They estimated were worth between 80 and 100 million dollars

1067
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,103
Obviously this is weird but to make

1068
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Things even stranger quotes

1069
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
Days earlier solder stopped

1070
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
Another Mercedes dump truck on its way towards the

1071
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
The Syrian border

1072
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,783
Hauling a load of

1073
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,063
2000 gold bar

1074
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,879
They look very similar to the one seized on Monday

1075
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Send

1076
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,719
In June another truck with 1100

1077
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
83 ingots

1078
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,815
That were suspected to be gold were intercepted by soldiers

1079
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
At a routine checkpoint

1080
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
This is very exciting stuff

1081
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,007
So these will definitely not be gold bars that were used

1082
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,311
To pay someone off

1083
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,127
Because there's an article in the Chicago Tribune about this

1084
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
These Bars

1085
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,991
Aren't pure like the bullion found it to Fort Knox

1086
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
But crudely melted bricks of

1087
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:37,183
The jewelry so yeah so it's most likely that they're all a bunch of rich people trying to smelt down their bulshit at

1088
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
As they flee the country

1089
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,839
The gold that Saddam Hussein it encouraged araki citizen

1090
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,399
To donate for his war effort against Tehran

1091
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Call Rich busy

1092
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,727
Has Matt many Rockies recall where expect

1093
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
Did the cough up

1094
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,519
325 lb

1095
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,591
The gold or face a visit from Hussein's Goon Squad

1096
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
The speculation was that this was asaph

1097
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,991
Fisticated and organized group plundering the wealth that Saddam had hoarded

1098
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
That's kind of exciting

1099
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,927
By August however there been some analyses on the gold bars and it turned out they weren't

1100
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,719
The gold it just look like it

1101
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,767
New York Times article quote

1102
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
Gold colored bars

1103
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,887
Seized by American troops in Iraq appear to be melted down shell casing

1104
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,447
Made mostly of copper rather than gold

1105
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,263
Okay who's mostly copper and zinc

1106
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,847
Check it out

1107
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
But it seems like

1108
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
It's almost certain

1109
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:35,039
This real-life story is the one that is distorted into being by globalist paying off back party officials of Republican guard

1110
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,623
It's not like the United States

1111
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Didn't

1112
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
Pay a s*** ton of money and then lose

1113
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,743
Never find out where it went

1114
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,815
Or if they did they didn't tell anybody

1115
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
Stop the bear enough

1116
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
True but not

1117
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,031
Not the claim we're assessing

1118
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,615
It's believable that they lose a s*** ton of monkey

1119
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
Corrupt

1120
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
But it's not

1121
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
Yeah Alex

1122
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,503
Spencer calls

1123
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
Kirkland's

1124
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
Is going to be in a little bit

1125
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,367
We take a call

1126
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
And this guy is a

1127
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,671
A complete weirdo

1128
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
And Alex

1129
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
Jumps in

1130
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
Very inaccurate JFK

1131
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
I believe

1132
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
DirecTV

1133
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
My God

1134
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
Pretty-much apparel

1135
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,383
And during the Cuban Missile Crisis and I just liked

1136
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,151
Say that

1137
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,223
I feel in a way that you're kind of the same way

1138
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
By trying to bring out

1139
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
People

1140
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Search you're being Direct

1141
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,671
I got in the same way to try and see

1142
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
The world

1143
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
President

1144
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Woke up

1145
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,903
War

1146
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,679
Declare war

1147
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:18,111
This is a fun story that Alex is telling about JFK would like to see aren't disconnected

1148
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
Kid from history

1149
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,743
So what are the things that Alex is doing here is that he's intentionally fudging

1150
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
The timeline of events in order to

1151
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,071
To create the appearance that things are more

1152
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,351
Connected than they are

1153
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:35,007
Operation Northwoods was crafted and presented to JFK Secretary of State Robert McNamara on March 13th

1154
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,823
1962 then breathe President Kennedy

1155
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,615
Alex is claiming that

1156
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,199
Six months later Kennedy was assassinated but that didn't happen until November 9th

1157
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
1963

1158
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:49,855
You know I wouldn't sound as compelling Northwoods a man year-and-a-half later he was assassinated

1159
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,135
Yeah that's a little bit

1160
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
Disconnected

1161
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,999
Compress that timeline and you meant much more suspense makes

1162
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,559
It sounds more like causality

1163
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:03,679
I don't want these things to feel closer in time and the audiences mind because that makes it feel like they're connected

1164
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
Or even like one leg to the other

1165
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,007
It's a rhetorical trick

1166
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
As for the other stuff

1167
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
Most of that's not true either

1168
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,407
Whatever you might say about JFK one thing you cannot

1169
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,479
Deny is that he was promoting globalism right up to the

1170
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,807
On June 10th 1963 if you want

1171
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,879
Before he was assassinated Kennedy gave a speech at that commencement

1172
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,415
For American University

1173
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,951
Which is what I was referring to

1174
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,487
Easy fun. Video

1175
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,815
This speech was about the hope

1176
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
For reaching World Peace

1177
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
There's a little path

1178
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,679
Some say that is useless.

1179
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:38,495
To speak of Peace our world our world disarmament

1180
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,591
And that it will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude

1181
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,407
I hope they do I believe we can help them

1182
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Conduit

1183
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:49,759
JFK supported World law which necessitates The Collector

1184
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
The body the kidney

1185
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,575
Enforce that law like the UN

1186
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,623
Wait is that why they

1187
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
Speaking of the UN

1188
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
Later in that speech he says quote

1189
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
We seek to strengthen the United Nation

1190
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,071
To help solve its Financial

1191
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,887
To make it more effective instrument for peace

1192
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Development

1193
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,215
Into a genuine World security system

1194
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,007
A system capable of resolving

1195
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,799
Disputes on the basis of law

1196
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,591
Seems like exactly

1197
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:18,431
The sort of thing that Alex's version of him wouldn't say okay okay let's

1198
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
Throw this one out there

1199
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,991
Haha

1200
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
Patriots

1201
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,319
Murder JFK

1202
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,183
The globalist from taking over compared to Alex is running interference

1203
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,255
To make it look like it was the global us all along

1204
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,047
When in reality was the

1205
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
Sure

1206
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,375
I'll go for that actually Timothy McVeigh

1207
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:41,727
On September 20th 1963 even more closed

1208
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,007
The date of his assassination

1209
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:46,591
They gave an address before the general assembly of the UN

1210
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
I don't think Alex would love

1211
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,687
The sentiment that was expressed in this speech

1212
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:57,087
The fact remains that the United States has a major nuclear power does have a special responsibility in the world

1213
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
It is in fact a threefold response

1214
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,439
Possibility responsibility to our own

1215
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:04,767
Responsibility to the people of the world who are affected by art

1216
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
Decisions

1217
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,583
The next generation of humanity

1218
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,959
Alex doesn't think that we have responsibilities to the rest of the world whether or not they've been effect

1219
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Goodbye our decision

1220
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
Like one of his Heroes

1221
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,359
Is Ron Paul and his big thing with one of them was eliminating literally all four

1222
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
Foreign aid

1223
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
The fuc

1224
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,711
Slogan is America first

1225
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,271
Cheese's in that speech from two months

1226
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:32,671
Before he was assassinated Kennedy talks with the UN about how essential International cooperation is to facing the

1227
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
The problems of the day

1228
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,743
And he brags about forming the peace

1229
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,535
Score

1230
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,143
He ends his talk with a list of things you'd like to see in the world that Alex

1231
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,959
Could make conspiracies up about all day

1232
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:49,055
Quote a World Center for Health Communications under the World Health Organization

1233
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,335
We could warn of epidemic

1234
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,383
And the adverse effects of certain

1235
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,223
Drugs as well as transmit the results of new experiments at new discoveries

1236
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:01,087
Eventually you my good buddy Bill Clinton will become Secretary General of the UN

1237
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
Do you think about

1238
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,487
Alex would be like oh my God

1239
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,255
A global

1240
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,583
System of satellites could provide Communications and weather information

1241
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
For all corners of the Earth

1242
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,935
And I'm sure that

1243
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
Late model used to track you

1244
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Listen to Satan would use to

1245
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
Obviously have

1246
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
Let's actually that right now to work

1247
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Oreo

1248
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,431
A worldwide program of conservation could protect

1249
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:29,503
Check the forest and Wild game preserves

1250
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
Extinction for all time

1251
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,367
Alex believe the conservationism is a globalist plot

1252
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:38,975
To destroy the beautiful coal and natural gas Industries

1253
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,815
By power shortage

1254
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,119
Destroying the Amazon rainforest

1255
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,655
He's being out there trying to

1256
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,447
To prosecute him for

1257
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
F****** crimes against

1258
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,775
Humanity for destroying the rainforest

1259
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Alex

1260
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,871
Would be really disappointed to see JFK on this side of the fence

1261
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
Have you would really hate this one

1262
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:01,247
We are opposed to apartheid and all forms of human oppression

1263
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,063
Like Alex doesn't like the

1264
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
Apartheid

1265
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:11,999
But opposition to it is a communist plot or at least that's what him and all his predecessors on the John Birch Society think

1266
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,583
We don't like the racism of a part-time we just hate that it

1267
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,471
The Communist trying to end apartheid

1268
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
Greatly enjoying it

1269
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,519
It said they're going to keep doing

1270
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,079
But it's the Communist that we don't lie

1271
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
Come on

1272
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
Anyways

1273
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,271
JFK that Alex believes existed as a fabrication based on dumb conspiracy books that he read as a youth and not based

1274
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Austin reality

1275
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
The speech that he

1276
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,391
We gave that included the line about secret societies

1277
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
Which is what I was trying to

1278
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,975
Flight with this American University

1279
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Bee speech

1280
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:48,351
Include the line about secret societies was from April 19th 61

1281
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,679
It's quite a while before the relevant time period that Alex is talking

1282
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
Think about

1283
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,471
It's one of the big

1284
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,751
Pieces of evidence that always go

1285
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
Gets thrown around

1286
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,567
Like every single

1287
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,103
Conspiracy documentary

1288
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,639
Conclude that line

1289
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:04,479
About him mentioning secret societies secret societies

1290
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
You know it's never going to not be

1291
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:12,159
Alex is trying to present the JFK heard about Northwoods tried to warn people and then he got killed

1292
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
He's just mixing up the American

1293
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,231
University speech

1294
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
Because it fits better in a

1295
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:21,631
Timeline it's all bulshit

1296
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,935
1861 from

1297
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,471
Society speech

1298
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,799
Julie misrepresented by conspiracy theorists

1299
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
Why here's the passage that they always use

1300
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
The very words

1301
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
Secrecy is repugnant

1302
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
In a free and open Society

1303
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:39,039
And we are as a people inherently and historically opposed

1304
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
The secret society

1305
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
Secret Oaths

1306
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,111
The secret proceedings

1307
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,951
We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted

1308
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
Concealment of Burton

1309
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Facts

1310
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,279
Far outweigh the dangers

1311
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
Which I decided to justify

1312
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,143
And that's why I f***** Joe DiMaggio's wife

1313
01:00:54,399 --> 01:01:00,287
Naturally is used to imply that this beach with a screed and a warning about secrets

1314
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:05,919
Forces at work behind scenes

1315
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
True

1316
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,735
This passage was JFK's soft

1317
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Ming's things up

1318
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
Before he asked for

1319
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,575
Increased secrecy from the Press

1320
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
Regarding official matter

1321
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
Here's what comes

1322
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,439
Just after that whole secrecy thing you see

1323
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
It just about every

1324
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,487
Conspiracy documentary

1325
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,911
No official of my Administration whether his rank is high or low civilian or military should interpret my words here tonight as an

1326
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
Excuse to censor the news

1327
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,471
Stifle dissent

1328
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
Or cover up our mistakes

1329
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,055
Exhort withhold from the press and public

1330
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,847
But they deserve to know

1331
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,639
Apparently that is what we're trying to

1332
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:41,759
But I do ask every publisher every editor and every newsman in the nation to re-examine his own

1333
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,551
Standards and to recognize the name

1334
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,831
Nature of our country's peril

1335
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,975
In time of War the government and oppressive customarily joined an effort based largely on self discipline

1336
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,535
To prevent unauthorized disclosures to the end

1337
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
In time of

1338
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:59,167
Clear and present danger the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must

1339
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,959
Yield to the Public's need for Nationals

1340
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
Security

1341
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:06,079
Today no war has been declared and however Fierce the struggle maybe it

1342
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,103
May never be

1343
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,639
Declared in the traditional fashion

1344
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,199
Our way of life is under attack

1345
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,527
Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe

1346
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,831
The survival of our friends is in danger

1347
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:20,415
And get no war has been declared no borders have been crossed by March

1348
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
Troops no missiles have

1349
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
Open fire

1350
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,047
If the price is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes

1351
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,095
The self-discipline of combat conditions

1352
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:32,191
Then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security

1353
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,519
If you're awaiting a finding of a clear and present danger

1354
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,335
Then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear

1355
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
It is present has never been born

1356
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
He is saying in the speech

1357
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
We all hate

1358
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
But

1359
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,063
You guys are going to have to stop

1360
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Reporting some stuff

1361
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,415
Because I wear danger cuz the Soviet Union

1362
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:58,303
Listen listen listen listen you don't want to you don't want to erode public trust in Torrance

1363
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,583
Institutions right that would be

1364
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
That really sucks up

1365
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,935
See what is things I think is remarkable is that context

1366
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,983
Is almost always missing

1367
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
From

1368
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
The conversations about like these peaches better

1369
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
It doesn't mean

1370
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
The point of this

1371
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
Wasn't exactly the

1372
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Opposite of what

1373
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:20,575
These people tried to presented at but the point will always

1374
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:24,159
Please just be that if you say secret societies regardless of

1375
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
The context of it

1376
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,231
We can say that you were sick

1377
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,071
Regardless of whether or not to warn the good people exactly

1378
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,655
Saying those words you were giving a code then people

1379
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,191
Need to unravel

1380
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,471
Sure and then your

1381
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,127
He was not planning to abolish the Federal Reserve and his proposed lowering of taxes wasn't completed by the time of

1382
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:48,223
But it was eventually signed by LBJ in nineteen

1383
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
Before

1384
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,807
Also the quote about scattering the CIA to the wind

1385
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
Is almost certainly not a real quote

1386
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,951
He didn't appear in print until a 1966

1387
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,999
It was attributed to an anonymous source

1388
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,047
3 years after his death

1389
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,399
There's no corroborating evidence that there was a position he had or that they ever said that

1390
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,519
He was definitely upset with the CIA after the Bay of Pigs that's true but I want a quote about scattering them

1391
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
To the wind is

1392
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,591
One that is very dubious sourcing

1393
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,615
Unlikely

1394
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,967
I don't know Alex should know more about JFK

1395
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,295
It's really hard to know stuff about history

1396
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,111
I think whenever people confidently assert

1397
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
But they know something about it

1398
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,927
Time. From the

1399
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
The past

1400
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
They're almost always wrong

1401
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,791
Because just in order to know something happened

1402
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
You need like a PhD level fee

1403
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
I think I think

1404
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,423
Alex is invested in

1405
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
Allure

1406
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
Fun stories

1407
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,519
Total and so why

1408
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Did you threaten

1409
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,847
Your ability to live in a fun world

1410
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,127
Full of myths

1411
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
And lower Trail

1412
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,711
True reality of things

1413
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,759
Complicated and there's detail

1414
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,343
I mean people really want to believe that there's a lock

1415
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,135
Ness monster you know what

1416
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,231
Alex

1417
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,815
So this is this is something that I really love when it happened

1418
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
Nobody can really tell like

1419
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,887
So earlier in the episode

1420
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,423
John Andrews told the second

1421
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
Story that he heard from Steve King

1422
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,519
About a teacher in Des Moines

1423
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,335
Trying to colonize America on behalf of

1424
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,151
I can't be racist let me tell you the story I heard from

1425
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
Steve King

1426
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Bright

1427
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
So we heard that

1428
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,295
Now here's Alex Bri bring it up and embellishing

1429
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
Sing it later

1430
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,359
So Erica

1431
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,711
Mexico the entire country government of Mexico

1432
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,295
Okay alright you see now

1433
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,087
Coming back is what we're saying here

1434
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:08,511
Glenn Spencer like he was living in California and agitating against immigration

1435
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,095
He decided the California was a lost cause Arizona

1436
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,423
And Alamo

1437
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,239
Santana might be in play

1438
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:21,823
Santa Ana the ghost of Santa Ana is is definitely involved

1439
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,871
You can see how Alex lies

1440
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
Like

1441
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,431
The story of the John Andrews was

1442
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,711
Telling the LIE it

1443
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
Itself

1444
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:34,879
So the state of maintaining the honesty of it or kind of low

1445
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:37,183
We're saying that Mexico

1446
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:41,023
African government is involved the consulate is sitting at the IDS just a

1447
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,071
To generate the whole idea

1448
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,399
Had multiple people community leaders

1449
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:51,007
Who have come up and told him we're taking it back we're taking Iowa

1450
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,079
I like a good

1451
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
I like a good UK

1452
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,919
Can trace it back and even then the story still alive

1453
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,527
It's riddled with so many lies that when you trace it back to its

1454
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Source you're just

1455
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:06,367
Appointed there isn't even anything fun or interest

1456
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
I think they're just like

1457
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,951
You've lying off of an even another

1458
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,511
Steve King made up erases lie

1459
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,559
John Andrews heard it

1460
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
He told it to Alex

1461
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,887
So now Alex is embellishing on it

1462
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
It's ridiculous

1463
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
End end

1464
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
Like I look

1465
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,007
Even if you're on the right

1466
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,055
Wouldn't you agree

1467
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,359
Somebody telling you a story that is

1468
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,431
So perfectly tailored to your hair

1469
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
Hatreds

1470
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:37,599
Shouldn't that give you a little signal of like maybe this isn't anyting

1471
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
From

1472
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Looking at a lot of this

1473
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
Conspiracy stuff

1474
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,463
That exist online

1475
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
Seeing

1476
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
How information

1477
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Is processed

1478
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,863
I don't think that a lot of people in these worlds

1479
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,143
Understand the notion of

1480
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:50,911
Too good to be true

1481
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:58,079
That is a 4in idea more perfectly tailored it is the more perfectly believe it fits

1482
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,663
Quickly into what I would expect or whatever hoe

1483
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,479
Especially when it's presented in meme forms

1484
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,527
Super easily digestible

1485
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,831
Got2b

1486
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
Do you know if it's

1487
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,647
Conform soap

1488
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,695
Perfectly to your worst nightmare

1489
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
Baby

1490
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,999
It's just a dream

1491
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:20,095
So Alex has this glowing in this production

1492
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,375
Infor Glen Spencer

1493
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Patrol

1494
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
What

1495
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,431
Totally Vindicated

1496
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,479
Yeah it's Alex's Buddies

1497
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,015
Glenn Spencer

1498
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,831
Just pretend fun let's act like cops came

1499
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,599
That's great

1500
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
That's great

1501
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:18,975
A lot of good people in their lot of good people just think hey you know what

1502
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,791
I need to go get a gun

1503
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,351
Because an imaginary line

1504
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,375
Will make me

1505
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
Me feel better

1506
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,495
I think that also this

1507
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,591
Introduces some Dynamics for the interview that make it not

1508
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
Very meaning

1509
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,503
Are you sure it doesn't

1510
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,295
You start off very adversarial

1511
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,111
Now I don't

1512
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,671
So he has some foam prop

1513
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,719
Glenn and

1514
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,511
One of the phone problems happens

1515
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,815
Just after I don't think that this is like

1516
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,583
Intentional

1517
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
At all

1518
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:58,911
If they were into

1519
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
2 conspiracies

1520
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Big idea

1521
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,567
Talking about all the other media that has had him on

1522
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,615
MN his phone mysteriously goes out

1523
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,175
Cleaver on with

1524
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
We were on.

1525
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,087
CNN

1526
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:20,415
Richard

1527
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:48,575
That's interesting because Alex's premise seems to generally be that these people won't have folks

1528
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
Glenn Spencer on

1529
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,695
But now Glenn does on the show and he's saying that I was on with Michael Savage

1530
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,255
Who Alex's said is a dirty neocon beat

1531
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,047
Call sure they'll have them on something

1532
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,583
Right right right right

1533
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:07,519
Put the heat on but what does that mean they won't put the heat on Laurel Bush meaningful heat is Alex putting on

1534
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,567
That other people what are

1535
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,847
I mean

1536
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,895
What is so hot

1537
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,967
But he's putting on Lord bush

1538
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,527
I want to know in Concord

1539
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,087
Creeper other places are not putting as much heat

1540
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:27,231
Lotaburger chili 50°

1541
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,535
I find it

1542
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,095
To be it sounds like Alex Grambling

1543
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,143
It's almost convenient

1544
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,191
That the phone cuts out there

1545
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,983
But I again I'm not saying

1546
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,263
I'm not saying that

1547
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,823
The Producers hung up on him or anything

1548
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Man

1549
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,151
He needed to save

1550
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,943
And you got an opportunity to make

1551
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,967
Save

1552
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,991
But it still doesn't

1553
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Make a lot of sense

1554
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
I mean

1555
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,831
Speed with which he said we got

1556
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
Cut off

1557
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,391
Normally he waits

1558
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
Just a little bit low

1559
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:01,023
No no no

1560
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
You heard aspie

1561
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
The he gave just

1562
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,095
A few months before this

1563
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
Alright

1564
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,399
Calm down

1565
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,703
So Glenn gets his phone back working

1566
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
And a half

1567
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
He has said

1568
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,335
That if you hear a bing bong bing bong sound effect in the background

1569
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,871
That is the alarm

1570
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,175
That one of his sensors has picked up an illegal

1571
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,455
Crossing the border

1572
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,783
Gibbs butcher sensors put up around the board

1573
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,391
Sensors on the border pictures of people

1574
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,183
Jesus

1575
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
Christ

1576
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,511
Holding Lea

1577
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
Only do so much in the world of bowling ball a perfect game and then what else you going to do

1578
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
Maybe you got to protect

1579
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,471
Borders

1580
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,359
So there's one thing that I do a

1581
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
Claude

1582
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,407
Glenn Ford

1583
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,735
La out in this clip after

1584
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
His alarm

1585
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,271
Goes okay

1586
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,343
Wanted to have you back on

1587
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,615
Arizona

1588
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
We just picked up five

1589
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,271
5 people

1590
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,839
Exact location

1591
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,399
An hour

1592
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,919
But we will eventually

1593
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,271
Actual locations

1594
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,111
For that

1595
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,159
These people are attacked

1596
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,695
Murdered and robbed

1597
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
Mexican band

1598
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,935
Oh

1599
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,471
Okay okay

1600
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,519
That's all

1601
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:25,407
Look what up whatever she has to tell himself to not publicize that information

1602
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,783
Fire tell himself that it's Mexican Bandits that are the that are the risks

1603
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,575
Do telling where they look

1604
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,111
Locations of these migrants are

1605
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,391
Haha

1606
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,927
Cuz they at the end of the day

1607
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,231
That information isn't going to these

1608
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,791
Weirdo f****** right-wing militias who think that are

1609
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
Countries being invaded

1610
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,607
So good

1611
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,423
Keep information to yourself

1612
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,471
We don't listen listen

1613
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,495
Listen

1614
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:51,775
I don't want Ben

1615
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,543
Bandidos hurting

1616
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
Okay

1617
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
I want me and my buddies

1618
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,943
Know that the others bodies would never

1619
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
They're never

1620
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,271
We wouldn't hurt anybody

1621
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,831
We want to protect them from the Bandidos

1622
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,111
Right2know

1623
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,439
And that's why we carry the guns in case we get into a bandit fight

1624
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:14,047
And and there's a stagecoach and we got is there we're going to fight on top of it

1625
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,583
And then we'll save the Immigrant

1626
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
And Save

1627
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:24,287
Forcefully

1628
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,847
Bit of a bayonet

1629
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,127
General directions

1630
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:34,527
That he gave someone my kids

1631
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
I pick you up by 2

1632
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,855
Undercut is on point

1633
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,439
I do like whenever the overconfidence of

1634
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,719
Will never find

1635
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,279
This

1636
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,815
To the beginning

1637
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,911
Of his interview he does say that if you hear that bing bong bing bong go off

1638
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
That it's my

1639
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:57,311
Getting whatever and then miraculously in the middle

1640
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,335
So weird

1641
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,663
So it's so great such great timing

1642
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
Like

1643
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,223
Exactly what you would want to do

1644
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,015
It's create an alarm

1645
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
That goes

1646
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:13,951
Instead of just some sort of an alert or something weird noise

1647
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
It's got to be the

1648
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:19,071
The bat-signal it's got to be over so it's got to be overdone

1649
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,095
Overwritten

1650
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
There's a big

1651
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:28,799
For each individual that causes the oh my God we have one last clip here and it's

1652
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,359
Glenn talking about a plan that he has

1653
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,943
City morgue

1654
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,135
For anybody who wants to log on to our website

1655
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,399
It doesn't work as a driver's license

1656
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,983
I got a thing

1657
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,287
But if you did do this

1658
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:06,943
You might get in the international trouble if he is actually going to sell

1659
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,039
Consular ID

1660
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,391
That's a serious problem

1661
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,511
I would advise him not to do this

1662
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
He was doing this and he was talkingshit

1663
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,399
I think it was funny about it is that if it were to go down

1664
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,679
The way that he wants it

1665
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,239
To go where everybody does this to subvert the

1666
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
The system

1667
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,543
What we'd find out is that

1668
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,079
Everything would be fine

1669
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,639
Thereby disproving his whole this

1670
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
What is the problem

1671
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:43,039
Argument possible

1672
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,623
They're just mad that other people have rights

1673
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,903
I don't I don't like

1674
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,463
Back in my day when I was young

1675
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,279
I didn't have to deal with other people having right

1676
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:57,119
And I feel like that was a better system for me so

1677
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,703
So like I said that was the last

1678
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,007
Honest-to-god

1679
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,823
There's another hour of the show

1680
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,871
Alex

1681
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
But

1682
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
I can't fight

1683
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,735
Find that last hour of the show

1684
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:18,879
Okay yeah the place where I found all these episodes

1685
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,719
And so we only have these 22 hours of the show

1686
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Now

1687
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
I picked a problem

1688
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
Boring call

1689
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:29,119
Or something I don't I don't know if there's anything nefarious

1690
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Apps

1691
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,983
This hour

1692
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,007
Speculate wildly

1693
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,311
The amount of like

1694
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Stuff about

1695
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,175
JFK and the bars of gold and

1696
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,991
And somebody figured like even without whatever dumb calls

1697
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,271
He takes on the 3rd hour

1698
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
I'm

1699
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:51,647
Satisfied with what we've learned today I like a good JFK conspiracy

1700
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,487
There's never a bad time to tell me lies about JF

1701
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,559
What's fun to about this is it was a a sort of

1702
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:03,679
Scattershot

1703
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,983
Anything but all over like what happened

1704
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:11,615
LOL everytime you go into depth of JFK's conspiracies you just find out something that disproves

1705
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,687
My man just yell Northwood that's fine

1706
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,991
Horrifying

1707
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,783
So

1708
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,831
I enjoyed going back

1709
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,415
That I've been reinvigorated

1710
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,207
I feel like

1711
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,487
Back on track

1712
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,791
I like it

1713
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,095
Jordan

1714
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:36,191

1715
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:40,799
