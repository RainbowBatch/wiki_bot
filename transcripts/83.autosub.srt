1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alex

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,824
To sit around

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,384
Little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,200
Yeah that's pretty much that's most of it

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
Let me ask you a question

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
So

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,648
When the the Earth was

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
About three billion

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
Immediately

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
Following I got to stop you already.

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
2000 years old we all know that

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,704
Fair enough

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
Family it is sick

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Thousand Years

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,896
So the Earth was about 4,000 years old window old

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:54,016
No it was it was immediately following the Earth being just a giant volcano

18
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,088
Right

19
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,696
Are you sure I know this pretty confident that he has

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
Race memory

21
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
Trees that were around then our

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,608
Still around now they are with

23
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
I know a lot about Alex

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
I don't know anything about Alex

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
Through another installment

26
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
Of my investigation

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
The 2015 what the hell happened to Alex Jones

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
Him to join up with Team Trump

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
Learn nothing today we will learn

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Zero about Trump

31
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
0 about the campaign but we will learn

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
A great deal

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,400
About crazy weirdos that Alex

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
That will be the flavor

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496
I'm a big fan of crazy weirdo

36
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,592
What was demonstrated in the past last we left off on

37
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
On the show in the investigation

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,200
Alex had indicated the humane

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
In contact with Russia

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
He was spouting nothing

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
But pro-putin

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Lime

43
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
All day.

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Supported Donald

00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,976
1776 0.0

46
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
Whitinsville chat on Americana

47
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,632
If that's where he is I think that's the end of

48
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
It is much it like

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Maybe

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm starting to realize more and more that the reality is

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Concurrent

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
We're doing that we think are

53
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
They aren't okay

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
One of them today

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Investigate

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Alex Jones love

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Yeah

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Rat

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Investigation about Trump

60
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
And I don't think that they're necessarily 121 related

61
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,560
Oh yeah no problem I don't think early Thursday

62
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
Like specific causation

63
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Because

64
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
We're going to find out

65
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
He doesn't

66
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
Like I'm after his

67
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
The Great

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
All this stuff just

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Divinity

70
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
I think that's

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
How would we do that

72
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
Okay

73
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
Remember the words were gripped

74
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Correlation

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
Causation thing or maybe it's not

76
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
See now that you know

77
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,264
No earned it from the book Freakonomics I remember nothing

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
You just blew my

79
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
Awesome

80
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
I feel like I got to give you a hand

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
Speaking of handicap is a handicap

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
Colleges are basically brainwashing

83
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
Today November 10th

84
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
November 12th

85
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Something that happened

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
Right around then

87
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
Becomes very important to Alex's narrative

88
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
And he gets off the

89
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Political bent

90
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Altogether

91
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
Victorville

92
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
And that is

93
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
That the University of Missouri

94
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
President step down

95
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
That's a big deal

96
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
It is when the president steps down

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
You know that's a big

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
You think you know what a system

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
Tim Wolfe

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
University of Missouri

101
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,287
It's cool the present of all of them not just

102
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,919
University of Missouri Columbia University of missouri-rolla

103
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
He stepped down and it was due to pressure that was put on him

104
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
Bye

105
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
It's not even necessarily black lives matter protest

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
But it was African Americans

107
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Who had very serious

108
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Complaints

109
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
About to

110
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
The University was dealing with relation

111
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
Piece of s***

112
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
He oversaw a

113
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
System

114
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
That was negligent

115
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
The student group

116
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
I came out of

117
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
It sort of naturally came together called

118
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Concerned stood

119
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
As a reference

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
21950 was the fur

121
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
Universe

122
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
System

123
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Allowed in Blackstone

124
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,719
There's a whole bunch of stuff that we're going to get into the

125
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,095
There's a lot about the reality of that situation

126
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
Did I happen to know a lot about because I don't think of any reason why you might know a lot about I'm from

127
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
University

128
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
My parent

129
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,175
Release my dad taught there for a long time and I still have it

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Associate

131
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:49,695
Yeah I have a lot of a lot of boots on the ground

132
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
In Columbia

133
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Pretty aware of what's going on there

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Wondered about the

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
Nations in that kind of b*******

136
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,263
Right

137
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
Is like

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,919
We need you to go away so we'll hire somebody who can actually implement the

139
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
That we need done

140
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,759
But to me it seems more like it's just brand

141
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
You know like whatever

142
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
A company

143
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
F**** up so hard

144
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Username

145
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
Right I think I think there's something

146
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Nothing to that

147
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
But

148
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,607
I definitely don't think

149
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
Change

150
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
That much

151
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
Missouri is still a very race

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Problems

153
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
Beyond even the

154
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Demands

155
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
The students were making

156
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Reiterate

157
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Even after that

158
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Course

159
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Carol

160
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
So let's get to this year's

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
The first clip

162
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
From November 10th

163
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
I said yesterday the professors are getting kicked out the

164
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Shein

165
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
The Climb of being white

166
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Fairies become a crime

167
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,967
Hysteria that has been created

168
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
Young mindless adult

169
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,023
Black member

170
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Exercise of power

171
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
Feminist professor

172
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
F***

173
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Identifying their writings and what they stand for

174
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Yeah pretty bad

175
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
What the f***

176
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,807
Sorry thanks for that deal with all

177
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
Walworth

178
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
Even in f****** Missouri

179
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
Which should be on fire

180
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
St. Louis should be burned

181
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Because St Louis

182
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
Knokes to play

183
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
In the story of what Alex Jones is talking about

184
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Cuz this concerns

185
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Student night

186
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
50 group

187
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Largely came out of

188
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
A lack of

189
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
On the administration

190
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Park

191
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
Blase

192
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Indignant occasions of violence of

193
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
Against

194
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,767
I don't even think they went that far because it sort of a talking about it

195
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Master and the student

196
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
Hey recognize that this is something

197
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
There wasn't really a response

198
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Is Ace

199
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Decadron

200
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
Charcoal on the wall

201
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Dancehall and I April

202
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Richmond resident Bradley

203
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Becker days later

204
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
And charged him with second-degree property

205
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
How much motivated by discriminate

206
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
Becker pleaded guilty in October

207
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
So that happened

208
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,167
Like I've brought up many many times

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
When I went to

210
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Where some guys

211
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
You were right

212
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Put a bunch of

213
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
All around the legion to believe

214
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Agent office

215
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
That Is Random with roots

216
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Some stuff

217
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Situation

218
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:36,767
Why why why

219
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Possible reasons

220
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
I know

221
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
Like what what kind of ass

222
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,239
That must be what it is

223
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
So they're intimidating them

224
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Know your place

225
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Do you because

226
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
You're not an idiot

227
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Conceived up

228
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Something you would want to do

229
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
But if you are someone

230
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Super caught up in your whiteness

231
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,839
And you're threatened by a quote-unquote uppity black people things like

232
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,935
Like the clan used to do with burning crosses

233
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
Be like a workout

234
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,543
Where are you

235
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,431
Like they have to get together and figure out the best way to be a f****** races or undoubtedly was

236
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Exactly

237
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
Photo like

238
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
Blue Sky Thinking like throwing s*** out there like what

239
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,231
What's the best way to be racist that's not subtle enough

240
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,583
I lived in Missouri they didn't have formal meetings they were just meet down by the river

241
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Orb down by the big

242
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Tree up which is a real thing

243
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
The real awesome

244
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Hey my buddies used to go drink

245
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Tree

246
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
Huge f****** tree those out in the middle of nowhere

247
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
We don't need Missouri

248
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
Great you guys where you guys were on the fence

249
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,159
In the Civil War I'm out that part of my history and I had a lot of great memories out by the big toe

250
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,999
So it on September 12th of

251
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
September 12th

252
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,143
These is called the n-word by a group of young people

253
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
Driving by in a pickup

254
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Student body president

255
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Then

256
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
They deleting the black Collegian

257
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
At a play rehearsal

258
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
But they were putting on

259
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
For homecoming

260
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
As they are part of the homecoming Court

261
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,623
And a man walked by

262
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
I called them all the n word

263
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Started screaming the n-word at the

264
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
It should be decriminalized

265
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
To get your ass

266
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
You call a group

267
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,775
I would say so there were your honor he called me the n-word

268
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
Good

269
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Concerns do Administration

270
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
And a lot of professors

271
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Losing a lot of

272
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Including a lot of these.

273
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Humanities

274
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
Apartments that I was super familiar with in college

275
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,975
They started to get on board but the administrative level

276
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
They were not

277
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
People were not dealing with these issue

278
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Concerned student nights

279
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
50 group

280
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
I came into

281
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
And

282
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Homecoming

283
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
There was the parade

284
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Satanic or C have

285
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
The student

286
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Groups

287
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
You have the president of the um sis

288
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Thank you the part of the parade

289
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Student 19

290
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
50 group gets together and they block his car

291
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
Formal protest

292
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Kiss car in order to get

293
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
To recognize

294
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Their demands

295
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
But they've not

296
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
So at this point

297
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
See how deep

298
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
If you are on the right side

299
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
You are a groupie

300
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
People who

301
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Republic

302
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
And who are just

303
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Telling everybody like

304
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Hey

305
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
This is what's going on

306
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
Right if you're on the wrong side you're a group of

307
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
People who in the dark of night throw cotton

308
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Like it's pretty pretty over

309
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Just stop in

310
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
Are we the ones I really don't feel great about what we're doing

311
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,167
I don't like you

312
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
I don't think that Jedediah is necessarily

313
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
Go more towards the area of like moose

314
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
Oh that's a good point

315
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:51,231
Alright it's just the brand hillbilly name

316
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Okay

317
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,351
That's very different

318
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
Block symbols car

319
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
They get

320
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
Moved Along by security

321
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
But

322
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
It's one of the big things that they had issue with

323
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,431
What's the Timberwolves did get out of the car and address their concerns

324
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
He didn't get out and say anything to them

325
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
Or do anything

326
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
Calm down the situation

327
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Rite-Way

328
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
F****** white dude

329
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Hit one of them with his car

330
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
But

331
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,047
This is actually something that I think is very

332
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Iffy

333
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,655
Because I've watched the video this and it's

334
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
The car is moving very slowly

335
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
And it also appears that

336
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
The person that he hits got in the way of his car after

337
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
After being out of the way of

338
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Okay

339
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,943
I see that there is a little bit of a both sides thing on this

340
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
Incredibly unacceptable at any speed to hit someone with you

341
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
Your car but I don't think it wasn't

342
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
I don't think it would have had a

343
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Slow reaction

344
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Or whoever was driving

345
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,815
And I don't think it was like a f*** you want to hit you with the car

346
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
But of course it made people even better

347
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
Because it comes on

348
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Tale of

349
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
Him and not being response

350
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
The students to make

351
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
And it's like even a bigger f*** you

352
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
So at that point the concerned student

353
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
1850 released a list of Demands

354
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
And one of them is with

355
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Teen Wolf needs

356
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
To resign you have not done a good job of addressing

357
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Our concern

358
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
He's not making

359
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
For minority students

360
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,487
And on top of that with one of their other big demands was

361
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Representation

362
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Faculty

363
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Minority

364
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
They wanted 10%

365
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Of the students

366
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Excuse me of the faculty

367
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
B2B

368
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Representative

369
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,359
Population representation

370
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
Right by people

371
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Sound of the

372
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
And at that point it was

373
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
It was not represented at all 01

374
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
It was at a point

375
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Greater representation

376
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Event beyond that they also one of their big demand

377
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
More funding

378
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,679
Ford Mental Health Services and on top of that

379
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,775
Representation of minority within the people working

380
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Student Health Centers and psychiatric

381
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Psychological

382
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Helps

383
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Because that also

384
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,271
Completely and utterly

385
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Reasonable request

386
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
Write the only one that you could act like you could Kim

387
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Conceivably argue with

388
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,207
Is the removal of the president

389
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,535
Of the school but I do think it's reasonable under the circumstances

390
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
So after that

391
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Jail time to

392
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:42,495
Found a swastika made out of poop

393
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
Are in the Mark Twain residence

394
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
Before and we kind of have an ironic

395
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,991
That kind of has an ironic feel to it right it's hard to say

396
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
The feeling that we had is like

397
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
You are actually a Nazi wouldn't make a

398
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,183
Swastika out of s*** and it's it's confusing but at the same time

399
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
People took that as a message of like well

400
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
It is not the iconography

401
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
And that people took it to field

402
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,191
I feel like the message there though is that Nazis are s***

403
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,543
The association

404
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Call associate

405
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
President Bill Donnelly said

406
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
After this event

407
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Including the others lost

408
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Schedule

409
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
Amir month-and-a-half earlier

410
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
After this event

411
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,207
Become clear to me that the inclusivity of our residence hall has been

412
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
Which is a reasonable

413
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
So

414
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
26

415
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Which is 6 days after the

416
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Swastika is found

417
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
The concerned student 1950

418
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Student-faculty president

419
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Unfortunately this meeting

420
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Did not go Gray

421
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Here's a quote

422
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
Wolf verbally acknowledged that he cared for black students

423
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
At the University of Missouri

424
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,463
However he also reported he was not completely aware of systemic racism

425
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
ISM sexism

426
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
A patriarchy on campus

427
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
Sounds very patriarchal

428
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
How to say right it's the

429
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Shows given the

430
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Pattern of info

431
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
And this list

432
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Stuff that we're going over to

433
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
Included a lot of other stuff

434
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Of course

435
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
So at that point there was October

436
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
On November 2nd

437
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Twenty-five-year-old grad student

438
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Jonathan Butler

439
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Started a hunger strike

440
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
He believed that it was that serious

441
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
And he was ready to die

442
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
For the cause and other students

443
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Bring out on campus

444
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
In solidarity with him

445
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
Scott City

446
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Started to

447
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Exist on the,

448
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
And I receive Missouri security we're like we're very respectful

449
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
Do this, thing where they were not going to f*** around

450
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,671
They got the pr of it

451
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,743
No one forced errors

452
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,535
So here is a quote from Jonathan

453
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Send Butler

454
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
As much as the experiences on campus

455
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Have not been that great for me

456
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,239
I had people call me the n-word I have someone write the n-word on the door of my residence hall

457
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
For me it really is about a call for justice

458
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
I'm fighting for the black community on campus

459
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
Because Justice is worth fighting for

460
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
And Justice is worth starving

461
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,295
He ended up having a hunger strike I think it lasted about a week

462
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Because

463
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
On

464
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
The 9th I believe ya on the 9th

465
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
Tim Wolfe ended up

466
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Stepping down

467
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
Now that only happen

468
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
Because on November 7th

469
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
The universe

470
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Missouri football team

471
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Went on

472
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Strike

473
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
To join

474
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Up with Jonathan Butler

475
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
And the student

476
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Two were

477
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Attempts on campus

478
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
So they would have lost

479
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Money

480
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
He'd wonder why

481
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Speed football team announced

482
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
The day add pledge

483
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
To stop participating in football-related activities

484
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
For the remainder of the season

485
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
Unless wolf resigned or was fired

486
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
Head to head coach Gary pinkel

487
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
I was on in support of this

488
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
Tweeted out a picture pricing

489
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
He tweeted out a picture of the

490
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Entire football program

491
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,911
With the subject line

492
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,495
The Mizzou family stands as one we are united we are behind our players

493
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Hashtag

494
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Concerned student

495
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
1350

496
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Signed Gary pinkel

497
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
So at that point

498
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Situation

499
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Is very serious

500
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Because

501
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
The university would have to pay $1000000

502
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
The Brigham Young University

503
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
If they canceled the neck

504
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
Of course the wolf

505
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Immediately resign

506
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
Actually that's not fair

507
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
The student football team

508
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
On the 7th makes that announce

509
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
On the 8th

510
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
Wolf is like I'm not going anywhere

511
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
He's gone

512
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
You going on tonight

513
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
But it also comes after lunch

514
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Slater's called on him

515
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,335
Representative a Republican

516
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,895
Chairman of the Missouri house committee on higher education

517
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,991
Wolf can no longer effectively lead the university system

518
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,575
Have you called for wolf or he called wolf reaction to protesters

519
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
Concerned Alice

520
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,952
Missouri Missouri Republican

521
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
I mean

522
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Two things there

523
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,888
Maybe friend

524
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Also

525
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
Think about how surprised

526
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
We are

527
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
At a republican condemning races

528
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
Or any representative really Governor Jay Nixon

529
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Hit Republic

530
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Cancel hard because

531
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Does everybody like

532
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
We got to give credit to

533
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,392
Inherently

534
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
Places that if any one of them goes

535
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,536
Hey racism is bad we're like holyshit you're a hero

536
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,632
Governor Jay Nixon said that he supported

537
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,752
These concerns must be addressed in the University of Missouri is a place where all students

538
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Can pursue their dreams

539
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
Living environment respect

540
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Tolerance

541
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Conclusion

542
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:11,968
Bunch of Faculty members that they were going to Stage a walkout and then immediately Tim Wolfe

543
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,064
Yes so that's so is

544
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
Is a crime to be white

545
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,440
Tim Wolfe his big crime is that he is white

546
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Weed that makes perfect

547
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,048
It's crazy it looks perfect it is it is a massive

548
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,144
Inability or unwillingness

549
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
To deal with the

550
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
The concerns are being brought to you by

551
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
So

552
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,080
Imagine if it was a white

553
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Right

554
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:46,272
Would would Alex feel the same let's not even

555
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,208
That is the reality of the situation

556
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,792
Left out some stuff that did happen that Alex

557
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Doesn't bring up

558
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,632
Because some of it ended up being a little bit of both

559
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,448
Like there was

560
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,776
There were rumors going around that the clan was on campus

561
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Some shooting at windows and stuff like that

562
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224
There were just internet gossip and rumors that started going around that accidentally ended up getting way more play

563
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,088
Play then they should have apologized that was bad information that we got

564
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Sensationalism

565
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
The rest of the stuff is very real

566
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,744
And the rest of the stuff is legitimate concerns

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
Now we get in

568
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,376
And go through the episode I apologize if that was a little bit long

569
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,168
But I needed a reality

570
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,496
No apologies

571
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
To say about Missouri

572
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
My home state

573
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
That for all its troubles

574
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,736
I still love dearly but we can't meet you all right

575
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
I'd be happy to be a moose

576
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
We've got one good mousse so we can't get to

577
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
Call Joseph Missouri immediately

578
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
He gets really sidetracked

579
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,888
Credibly f*****-up trap topic

580
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Here's one of them

581
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
I was growing up

582
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
Anywhere in the city in Dallas

583
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
Every week sometimes

584
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Couple times a week

585
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Jump out of cars

586
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,600
This is our neighborhood

587
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Buckle up Knuckle Up

588
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,000
Sometimes it was

589
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Oh boy

590
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,952
Many times when college-age men

591
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,048
What show off and want to beat up high school students

592
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,144
Post hole digger

593
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
That's a shovel

594
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,360
When people got basically you do hurt really bad

595
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
The big combo

596
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
Organized somebody else

597
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
46070 years old

598
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
And Rob them and beat them up

599
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,104
Discrimination

600
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,480
You are told

601
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,296
No way

602
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
4

603
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Just running around phrase

604
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Because

605
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,504
Working well with others in company

606
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,344
I love you

607
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,792
And totally absolutely

608
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
Your brain

609
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
1

610
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,360
Hazing ritual

611
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
Exploring Revolution

612
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Military science

613
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
This is the most base level

614
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,464
10000 BC level science

615
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,816
So at this point the reason I left

616
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,912
Well I left in its entirety there because I wanted

617
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:25,312
To get the like the beginning of him being like I wasn't racist but not racist

618
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
There's mostly minorities being racist

619
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
That's white people right right how white people are the victim yet again

620
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
If you go to his

621
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,904
Current state of being I don't know if that's fair

622
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,840
But at the same time it goes into zen-like a call this tribal like how people go beat up gay that's why gay bars

623
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,656
Cuz they're not normal

624
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,008
But the reason I kept it in as a whole was the journey from the

625
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,800
Racist not racist gang fights

626
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
To the end or he's like

627
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Beast

628
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Who are

629
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
Making legitimate

630
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Concern

631
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,760
And not being heard at all so they take it to the next level

632
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,576
Of this hunger strike that public protest

633
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
It's getting the

634
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,696
Lobbied for the football team 2

635
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
You know boycott

636
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
Think I might have been the wrong decision

637
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:22,144
But all those things because they were

638
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
When they were younger

639
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:29,056
F*** no closer than

640
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
Philly protest

641
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
Rites of Passage racism

642
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
Why do you want to come

643
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,648
Now we were looking

644
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
Love

645
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
Liberty

646
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,816
Informed delivery

647
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
Alright fine I'm going to go to Breitbart

648
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Define

649
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,776
Conception is your on the

650
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
Like I said we walk through the history

651
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
Just a day earlier

652
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
Tim Wolford resign

653
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
He's responding

654
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
It's not the month

655
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,088
Lead up to this but he could have been aware of if you wanted to

656
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Nah but

657
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,768
His conception is that what's going on is like the Chinese student Revolution

658
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
That happen

659
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
That one

660
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,144
But he's saying that this is the beginning of that

661
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,984
Right and that it's just going to turn us into a Maui state

662
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
I all this s***

663
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
So he's going

664
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
Kill all the intellect

665
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Probably not

666
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
No sew

667
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
He's responding to it as

668
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
As if it was

669
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
Instead of dealing with the reality of people

670
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
And so here's how he responds

671
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
Which

672
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Is really scary

673
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Missouri

674
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
Over the top

675
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,496
The first years of Mao in China

676
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
Protest

677
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
With the young people

678
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
The most

679
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
By the system

680
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,224
Absolutely

681
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,552
40 hour are you guys

682
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,136
Our forebears were ready for this

683
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
We got the jump on you about 200 something years

684
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
Propaganda

685
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,736
Mobile.

686
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
So

687
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Do you think he

688
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,928
He must not know the context at all right he's just going straight from the hip like he heard that a white fur

689
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
President stepped the black people protest

690
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,328
So he's just shooting from the hip this is all white victimhood

691
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,168
He has no idea what the f*** is going on family doesn't realize

692
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,008
Is it peaceful at all or who cares if it's peaceful

693
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,128
Something should be burned out very burned down the only thing

694
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,688
Lydia ever brings up really are

695
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
The poops Waze

696
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,344
And someone maybe allegedly yelling the n-word it somebody at a party

697
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:26,464
He brings up now there's one other thing that we should do

698
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Cuz it does come up eventually

699
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
First of all he's threatening

700
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
That's what he's doing

701
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:35,936
Our forefathers thought about this

702
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
Yeah that's f***** up but the other thing is

703
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Are you taking the Second Amendment

704
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,360
Is entirely about shooting black people cuz I think that's what Alex

705
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
The downside of what

706
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Fenton Missouri

707
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
Alex will y'all about this later

708
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
God bless him

709
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
In for it

710
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
Saudis

711
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Set up an

712
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
Publix

713
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,632
They did not want reporters coming in bothering

714
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
And so they were trying to

715
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Reporters

716
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Do leave

717
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,312
And an unfortunate video came out

718
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
I love this lady

719
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Melissa click

720
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,920
Who was a professor at the University

721
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,736
Was trying to get

722
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:27,648
A reporter called I need some muscle over here

723
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
She's terrible

724
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,232
And that's unfortunate bad opt

725
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Disagree

726
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Disagree entirely

727
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Muscle over there

728
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
Agree with you

729
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
It's not it's not okay

730
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
I I get the point

731
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
And journalist

732
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
Should have respected

733
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
That hate don't bother these people

734
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
They're setting up a

735
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,248
A peaceful place where they can be left alone

736
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
But to make a point

737
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
And they are also going to be portrayed

738
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
For how by those p

739
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,976
Absolutely I agree of their own volition

740
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
But it's

741
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
The same time

742
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
It's not appropriate

743
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
To contextualize it is we need muscle to forcibly remove people from a public space

744
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,056
More with you

745
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,848
Without the look

746
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
What what is it

747
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Listen

748
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
They have done every

749
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,064
Single f****** thing that they could

750
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,904
Finally if you don't have the threat of violence

751
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
People these people

752
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Alarcon Alyssa

753
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,024
In the same way that the Black Panthers

754
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Stand around

755
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,608
Whenever a police whenever a cop was arresting

756
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
A black dude

757
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
They would stand around in

758
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Full uniform

759
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
With guns

760
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
Right

761
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
In their hands now

762
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
That's f****** muscle

763
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:53,408
Violence against them

764
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Fine

765
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
You're arguing

766
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Completely

767
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,088
Point I agree with your point in as much as that goes

768
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,880
But I don't believe

769
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
But it's appropriate

770
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
It would be appropriate if they just had

771
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
With guns

772
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Go ahead right scary

773
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
That would be appropriate

774
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
What's not appropriate

775
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
Is forcibly removing people from

776
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
Workspace for no

777
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
That is not appropriate

778
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,288
If they had a show of muscle

779
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,848
Down there

780
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:28,992
But it's not okay for the like let's say the Black Panthers to run people off

781
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Who aren't doing any

782
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Anything that is

783
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,368
In the situation that you brought up

784
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Rabbits

785
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
Especially not appropriate

786
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
For this

787
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Professor

788
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,024
To be acting in a coordinating e fashion

789
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
When that wasn't her position

790
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,704
I recognized and you do have some good

791
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
There is a difference

792
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,568
Between the scenarios that you're presenting in what actually we're talkin to

793
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,408
At the same time I think we can agree to this

794
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
Degree and just agree that it's terrible.

795
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:06,112
Gave people something to attack and Melissa click was pretty round

796
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
F*** you bought

797
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,720
Yeah I'm doing this right. Fire

798
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Right

799
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:17,632
People involved in the movement weren't like

800
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,448
Hey great good time

801
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
You're making us look terrible

802
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,872
This is not the this is not what we want to present ourselves at and a

803
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
Forty-five-year-old

804
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
Red-headed white lady

805
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,016
So she's not even she's definitely not the one you want speak

806
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,880
Looking for a gallon we need muscle to get this journalist out of

807
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Zoe

808
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,512
That's more where I'm coming from with all that context

809
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
I'm much more

810
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Towards your side

811
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
I think it's

812
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
Not the best

813
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,264
It's just an unfortunate element of

814
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,824
What otherwise was a really good

815
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,128
And really well put together protein

816
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,920
888

817
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,296
I just I'm just this this place now where

818
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,368
It's like the entirety of the system

819
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
Is the problem

820
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
And Ever every protest that we have

821
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
The women's March was

822
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Huge

823
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
What the

824
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
The f*** did it do

825
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
Boston earlier the

826
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Yeah

827
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Did it

828
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,080
No no but thing entirely within the system doesn't

829
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
To be effective

830
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Because the system

831
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
Itself is

832
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Is the issue

833
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
The system itself is

834
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Set up

835
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
To stop

836
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,296
Define Simba system

837
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
And

838
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
Meaning of not respecting the rights

839
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Of the press

840
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Not respect

841
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,696
In the rights of other people

842
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,488
They're not mutually

843
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,304
Exclusive you can still work outside the system

844
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
And not

845
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
Trample someone else's

846
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Is right yeah

847
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
And I don't I don't think that

848
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
The First Amendment

849
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Being

850
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
The system

851
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Is the right way to look at

852
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
I agree there's other things that should be done there's other

853
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Disruptive

854
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,664
Things that we should be doing outside of

855
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Just

856
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
Protesting

857
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:13,344
Getaround I don't know if it's the right answer but the Democratic Socialist they're making some

858
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,928
Real Headway in terms of organizing protests

859
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
Right

860
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
Just be having meetings

861
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
Things like that and maybe that's something

862
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,352
What is outside of our normal system

863
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
They could be helpful

864
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
I don't think

865
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
That

866
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
Having muscle to

867
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
Forcibly remove journalist

868
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,056
Outside the system in the right way

869
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
That's a step backwards

870
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,616
Supposed to step forward

871
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
I agree

872
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,712
Let's move on.

873
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:46,112
Okay I want I want I want to be angry and I want to do all that stuff but you are you are correct

874
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,440
This is why the podcast is wonderful

875
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,536
I can smoke you down February

876
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
Anger

877
00:37:54,816 --> 00:38:00,960
But I don't disagree with other things not this

878
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,264
Matter of planning

879
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,336
Execution is opposed

880
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
In terms of

881
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
Like I agree with your point but I don't agree with the knee-jerk

882
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Response you have to

883
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,784
Situation situation

884
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,136
Like we can agree on the gold immediate reaction

885
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
People have to get worked up hot and bothered

886
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,512
About like how she is right to get muscle over there

887
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,376
I think we got to we got to be very careful when we examine

888
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
The corporate media being

889
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,080
Again

890
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Okay well then

891
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,088
Journalist

892
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
Play what is the person doing

893
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Like is the person

894
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Is the journalist

895
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Being

896
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,840
Adjective

897
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:09,056
Something about

898
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,080
I'm going to ask

899
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
This team is space that you guys are

900
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,944
Who created on what's going on

901
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,832
It is absolutely different from the

902
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
Is the campus paper

903
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,952
Semesters

904
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
F*** her I'm out on alright good now let's see if you defend Alex

905
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:37,472
It is his claims that he's been the victim of racism

906
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,152
The last few years does multi-finger this

907
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
Come on guys you're just looking for trouble

908
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,816
I care about you and I bet you do.

909
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
No

910
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
IPad

911
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
IOS

912
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
Weather models

913
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
So

914
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
Describing panhandling

915
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,392
He's a victim of it because he's white in the

916
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
Right type of reparations

917
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Has a large homeless population

918
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,864
We go back to over and over again

919
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Your black people

920
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
White people

921
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,520
At this point everyone has transcended race

922
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,128
Everything stayed the same

923
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,736
I left that clapping just to give you a sort of context

924
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
For like

925
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
With his own experience

926
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
The raisins

927
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,880
Which is deeply flawed

928
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Is there anyway

929
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Through these guys

930
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
They're white.

931
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
Victimhood is

932
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
Really believe that

933
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
He's the victim of racism

934
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
Shows like this

935
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
Or people

936
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Understanding more

937
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
Like I really think that

938
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
People who listen to his show

939
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
Listen to shows like this

940
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,808
It could give him a better context of the world in the things that

941
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Talkin about

942
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,416
Maybe

943
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,976
Program.to Buy

944
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,816
So I think that if his base eroded and people really understood this

945
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
The situation

946
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
You talkin about it where the lies are

947
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
And why he

948
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
He's lying about

949
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
I think it could help

950
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
I don't know if it would ever reach him

951
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
But if you hit it

952
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
Is pocketbook hard enough of people not buying

953
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Supplements

954
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,663
Right maybe

955
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
Maybe there's a chance

956
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
Yeah

957
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:03,135
President of the University of Missouri

958
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,719
He's still around at this point in November 4th

959
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
I don't know I don't know if there's much hope in

960
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,815
Educating out

961
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Of educating

962
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
And helping

963
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
The other people

964
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,679
Not have these narrative

965
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,519
Psychological studies always put forth

966
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
Whenever you bring facts

967
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Or any of the

968
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
The s*** towards

969
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
People who look

970
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,735
Get mad they just get mad and more entrenched in their white victimhood

971
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,783
Yeah yeah that's probably true

972
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,391
I'm a good answer but there's

973
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,439
Boy I think not

974
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Trying is not the answer

975
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
Yeah I agree with you there

976
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Let's get to this next clip

977
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Cheese wedges

978
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Green all over the

979
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
In the next life Alex Jones

980
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
His big problem is

981
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Is sjw

982
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
Social justice

983
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
Warriors

984
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Crop up

985
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
This

986
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,527
Parallel and it's really unfortunate

987
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
Such

988
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,415
Obviously good things into epithet

989
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,975
Right

990
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Social justice

991
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
Is good

992
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
And you should fight for

993
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
They do

994
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,191
What how is that

995
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
How can you

996
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,287
Turn that into some

997
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
His belief is that the globalist

998
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Invertebrate

999
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
This is actually social injustice

1000
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,039
Black lives matter is just White lives don't matter that's

1001
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
Entrenched in his head

1002
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
I agree

1003
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Anyway

1004
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
This clip

1005
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,511
It really fun

1006
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
And I will explain why

1007
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,631
On the other end of it but it has to do with social justice Warriors

1008
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
And another period of

1009
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,847
This is a parallel Richard

1010
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Parallel

1011
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
I bet you did

1012
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:05,247
Witch Trials versus the social justice

1013
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,831
Emeritus

1014
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,415
The episode is one of the nation's most notorious cases

1015
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,791
Political

1016
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,631
Cautionary Tale

1017
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Dangers of

1018
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
Isolationist Behavior

1019
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:29,567
False accusations

1020
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:48,767
Right yeah

1021
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:55,167
Watch actually engaged

1022
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,199
Look at the Inquisition and lot of other operations very different

1023
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Claiming other people

1024
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Corrupt

1025
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,959
He just changed it over with social justice

1026
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
Now the other guy quotes

1027
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Asteria

1028
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
Socialism

1029
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
Politically correct

1030
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:04,287
Justice Warriors instead of Salem witch trial

1031
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
It's

1032
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
Oh this is

1033
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
Well-thought-out

1034
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,223
That's what makes notes not right

1035
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
And then

1036
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:20,671
Like but they were worshipping

1037
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,303
The problem is

1038
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
Like let's take the Inquisition

1039
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
And stuff out of it

1040
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Because that's totally

1041
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,727
If you look at what's going on

1042
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
In terms

1043
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Special because everybody's mad about

1044
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Missouri situation

1045
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,151
The Salem Witch Trials there is a

1046
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Glaring parallel

1047
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,967
And it's not

1048
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
This

1049
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,039
What it is is the Salem witch trials

1050
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
Were largely about

1051
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
Taking property away

1052
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
From people who had wronged

1053
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,207
I always get the names mixed up

1054
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
Families involved

1055
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
The Putnams I think the porters with a good

1056
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,679
Can't remember but it was about Hatfield

1057
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
It's whatever you want

1058
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:10,847
It was largely about a bunch of either widowed or single women who owned land in Headland

1059
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
Disputes with the Putnam family

1060
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
The patriarchy

1061
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,943
Putnam family

1062
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
We're the ones

1063
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
Who kept getting

1064
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,271
Pointed out as witches

1065
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,319
Buck's social Norm

1066
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,855
People who didn't go to church

1067
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,743
A white lady who married a black guy

1068
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
Yep those were the things 7

1069
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
I can't allow her to have

1070
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:37,215
Those word what with motivating the Salem Witch Trials it wasn't about Mass hysteria it wasn't

1071
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,079
And if you look at what's going on

1072
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
And Missouri situation

1073
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
The people who are against it

1074
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
Are trying

1075
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
Power

1076
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,319
In the hands of white people white males

1077
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,647
Specifically I always keep saying that the crime is being

1078
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
It's not you're not listening

1079
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,487
Do what's going on at all

1080
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
It's about maintaining the

1081
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,327
Status quo that is racially and

1082
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
Gender Lee Bass

1083
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,423
Yeah well so that's unfortunate

1084
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
Since you could describe it as a

1085
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,287
Is a mass hysteria in that these people are

1086
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,079
Drumming up amasis

1087
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:18,175
Asteria

1088
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
Oligarchs

1089
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,991
Utilizing poor people

1090
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
Accomplish their goals

1091
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,831
In the same way as with

1092
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
About there

1093
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,951
The oligarchs are using their power

1094
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
Drama

1095
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
You know

1096
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,095
Anti everybody but white people

1097
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
In this in this case if you want to do them

1098
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,471
The parallel the people who are protests

1099
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,567
About the ignoring of racial incidents and stuff like that

1100
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Black student

1101
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,895
The concerned student rights

1102
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,223
50 are the people who were accused of being witches

1103
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
They are the victims

1104
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,087
Damascus Syria

1105
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,743
The reporters are the administration or even Alex

1106
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,559
Is Elkhorn

1107
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,375
The wiser you guys are creeping socialism

1108
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
So that's all bulshit

1109
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
Text Libby gets take a little break

1110
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
Unfortunately

1111
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
God dammit

1112
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,639
Because we have a guest

1113

That we've dealt with

1115
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
What is

1116
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,527

I'd heard a lot

1125
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
From people

1126
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,223

People he broadcast

1133
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
With shades on

Storms off to his office

1137
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,311
And then comes back out so you won't have

1138
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
How to talk to people during commercial

1139
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,919
The two guests on the show where me

Any treated both of us like ask

1142
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Miserable

1143
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,647
When I was when I was in the waiting room

00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,679
And then the second hour live

1151
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
It's very convoluted

1152
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
Green Room

1153
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
I was watching the last

1154
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
And like

1155
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Ringo

1156
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:03,039
Watching computer

1157
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,255
Play great or bad thing by Ringo Starr

1158
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
And here's Mancow just treating him like it

1159
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:19,423
Could go badly for Open Mic comedian

1160
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,239
I think it is kind of funny to Trego like a dick

1161
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,543
If I could do it all over I would have been

1162
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,359
Anasshole back brace

1163
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
6 in the morning

1164
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,687
May be hungover for

1165
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
From shows the night before

1166
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,271
Alright man

1167
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,575
You got it the producer kept ask

1168
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
Refurb it

1169
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,879
That I could do like

1170
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,671
He could set me up for a bit

1171
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,743
The only thing I really recall is how much I hated

1172
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
And

1173
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
How much you talked about being

1174
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
I'm friends with the

1175
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
Blues

1176
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,679
The band The Moody Blues

1177
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,151
40 years The Moody Blues have been fighting

1178
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,223
Ringo's Pacifica Noble fight

1179
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
Hate Ringo

1180
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,551
Best there like come on man

1181
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
Such a dick

1182
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
Such a dick

1183
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
And a liar

1184
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,167
You know I would have to decide what Missouri

1185
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
What they should have said is that okay

1186
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
You're going to college for free

1187
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
And you're done

1188
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
UCF

1189
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
Every year I

1190
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,391
I pay for some of the college because it's not

1191
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Based on

1192
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,719
I bet there's no why

1193
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Warriors command

1194
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,495
And they took the SATs in about 2 minutes

1195
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,567
Weekend

1196
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,847
Commitment

1197
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,503
You push through whatever University

1198
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,343
Morons are usually violent look at the worst team in the NFL

1199
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,671
Violent morons of Mizzou

1200
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,791
Destroy this man and entice just it's it is something isn't a teaser

1201
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,815
Strange Days

1202
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,911
So idle employing their these violent moron

1203
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:33,311
Clearly talking about the tech people is a trouble it's trouble for his argument that we don't care

1204
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
That they don't care

1205
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,759
They preferred nose

1206
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
They don't like

1207
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
That's a big issue

1208
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,903
At the same time if we want to look at is complain

1209
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,463
It is f***** up the way that psychology

1210
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Napoli's

1211
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,023
Oh absolutely

1212
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,327
But there's a better way to discuss that probably

1213
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,631
Meijer

1214
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
Ncaa's

1215
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,959
Yeah something like that

1216
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:05,823
What I went to frost when I went to the University of Missouri I had a couple of

1217
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,127
Strong's called in French

1218
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
But there were a couple of acquaint

1219
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,455
Chances that I had who were on the football team

1220
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,015
And I was in a logic class

1221
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Two of them

1222
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
Super nice

1223
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,111
Work real hard

1224
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,903
He was in class everyday

1225
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,231
Couple times I was walking down the

1226
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
Street and pulled over offered me a ride

1227
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,351
Coming to the movie theater that I worked at the time

1228
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Who is super nice

1229
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
Baltimore super nice

1230
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,775
Other one would sleep through class

1231
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
And at one point offer

1232
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
To pay me to do his homework

1233
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,383
There are situations like that

1234
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,943
The people who are the student-athletes

1235
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,991
And make tons of money for the University

1236
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,039
Get to do and get away with

1237
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
It's pretty f***** up

1238
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:52,671
It's pretty booked up how many hours a week do they work on

1239
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,207
Tons

1240
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
Well more than 40

1241
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
So if you are like

1242
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,119
Okay we need you to work 40 hours a week

1243
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,191
Also we need you to do all of this s***

1244
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,751
Right and we're not going to pay you

1245
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,847
The high-level logic class

1246
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
There's no business

1247
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,967
I don't know what happened

1248
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,503
But be that as it may

1249
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,551
I'm not saying that you did anything

1250
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,879
He's a system in place that needs to be

1251
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
Maybe logic

1252
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Put them to sleep

1253
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,327
Rather than take care of melatonin

1254
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Missed calls

1255
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Hockey massage

1256
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
Okay

1257
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
My wife

1258
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,127
And I were arguing

1259
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,199
And you're overreacting

1260
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,623
She goes after using logic and thinking this all out and looking at the facts under your right

1261
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
I overreacted

1262
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,999
Would never happen

1263
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
It's all emotion

1264
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
Ride

1265
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,471
That's so like

1266
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,543
1980s

1267
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,383
It's just evidence that says something about men

1268
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
Are from Mars

1269
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,223
Women

1270
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,807
That is

1271
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,879
So I actually didn't load right

1272
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,951
That sucks

1273
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,231
You can tell

1274
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,023
You can tell how much

1275
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Assholes

1276
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,839
Even their fake laugh

1277
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
Annoying

1278
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,423
Totally when we

1279
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,471
It's real

1280
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
No it's not

1281
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
It's not funny

1282
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
10

1283
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,735
Real or fake

1284
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
Anyway look we don't need to

1285
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,575
Belabor this point who cares

1286
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,903
Next clip loaded correctly

1287
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,207
We'll see is Mancow pretending

1288
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
Doesn't live in the suburb

1289
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
A boy

1290
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
Brother

1291
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,095
Understand I live in Beirut

1292
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,655
Broad City

1293
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
Located low-grade

1294
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,383
He lives in the city of Chicago

1295
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
Like I said I was on his show

1296
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
I know where he works

1297
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
He works

1298
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:29,855
On Michigan Avenue and South water that is where the

1299
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:36,255
The studio was if you don't know Chicago that is a Nao block

1300
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:42,655
Away from the Magnificent Mile.

1301
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:51,103
You can possibly be it might even still be a part of the Magnificent Mile I don't know where that starts or ends

1302
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,895
But it hit Wacker there

1303
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,175
And you know it

1304
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,223
It's much less

1305
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:02,623
On the side of South water but it's like a block away from that expensive

1306
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,975
That's nonsense

1307
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,791
Even dead birds have to step over cuz they have

1308
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
Tentatively

1309
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Cleanup Crews

1310
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
All around that area

1311
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,703
Like if you work in a building

1312
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,775
And you're twenty feet away from my eyeball pain

1313
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Aurate

1314
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,127
Petit Marche I would love the way that you

1315
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,247
Obama

1316
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:36,671
Go f*** yourself and pretending you're in the s***

1317
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
F******

1318
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
Warrior on the Southside

1319
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,559
I work until tonight I wouldn't even claim that

1320
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,631
Cuz it's not true

1321
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
Oh no

1322
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,959
I lived on the west side of

1323
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
Chicago for a while and

1324
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,847
I did

1325
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,639
Bus stop

1326
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
That was just

1327
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
On fire

1328
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:04,831
It was just on fire.

1329
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
F*** is wrong with you

1330
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,183
I'm dessert like their response becomes

1331
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,863
Like that that I felt a little bit bad about but at the same time

1332
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,911
I don't have any responsibility

1333
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,447
I was walking home from

1334
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,519
From the train and I saw a guy just laying on the street

1335
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,847
That guy probably needs help

1336
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:32,479
What's the same time there were three people standing next to him like sort of looking at him and there was a cop car across the

1337
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,759
The street park

1338
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,551
And the people like the cops were looking

1339
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,599
Bring in that direction of like

1340
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,439
Needs to be done it's going to be done who cares

1341
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,255
What do you mean you know the one where

1342
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
I don't even know if that's

1343
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Whatever

1344
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
The famous

1345
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,143
Story of a woman

1346
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
Who was

1347
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Crying out for

1348
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:57,055
For help o b water effect

1349
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
Well somebody else's

1350
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,967
Except for the fact those people standing next to him We're clearly engaged

1351
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,807
With him laying back

1352
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
Very important

1353
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Reminder

1354
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,415
Not always will people last

1355
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
Should have gotten some more

1356
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,351
So at this point Mancow pivots and wants to talk a little bit about the election

1357
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,263
Look I want to talk about Gamboa quickly

1358
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,127
I don't believe are you ready for this

1359
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,735
Do you talk about the different network cyborg for I I've been in these

1360
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
TV newsrooms

1361
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,831
I work for fox in Chicago for the last 2 years

1362
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,303
Behind the scenes of CBS

1363
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,583
Other newscaster

1364
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,143
What Donald Trump said was correct

1365
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,447
They do pick the winner and the loser

1366
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,263
Again I don't know that it's Senator Alex

1367
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
I was there

1368
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,615
All the big names

1369
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,919
Play pretty-much

1370
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
And the fight was Hillary versus

1371
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,295
Will Hillary's near Dad

1372
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
He's very sick

1373
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,135
Really stupid she's really running an awful campaign

1374
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
And on the right

1375
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,511
Jeb Bush was going to have all the money

1376
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
So I don't

1377
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,119
Believe his presentation of that

1378
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Insights

1379
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,959
Spot on lamb.

1380
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Absolutely

1381
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,567
So I believe is maybe he was in a me

1382
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
Somewhere

1383
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,431
That's probably the expensive

1384
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:44,063
His Insider ISM says I was there when it was decided

1385
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
As if

1386
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,135
The globalist

1387
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,719
Had Mancow Muller in for a f******

1388
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:55,583
Session where they're like hey hey buddy you want to be in on the ground floor of this

1389
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
The gang of 42

1390
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:07,871
Bastard turned out to be f****** manto I love how I labeled one of these clips

1391
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,151
I feel very proud of it

1392
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:15,807
Repeat it on a cowardly racist

1393
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:20,415
For you.

1394
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:24,511
Batman cowl

1395
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,535
Vladimir Putin

1396
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,095
Turns out he also likes

1397
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,375
Check this s*** out

1398
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,703
I'm actually very proud of the American people

1399
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,591
The Communist but whatever they requested

1400
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,431
What was selected for them and then on the right keyboard picking Trump

1401
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
And and

1402
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,271
The establishment

1403
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,319
Because we're not following the script

1404
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,367
Listen

1405
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
Marine

1406
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,207
You are big supporters of the military

1407
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,767
They have to do a lot of things that they don't like

1408
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:02,911
The deal isn't that that hospital those poor kids that were killed at hospital

1409
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
Cleveland Heights

1410
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Jeb Bush

1411
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,543
He doesn't want other bush

1412
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,335
Family

1413
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
Middle East

1414
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:18,015
And what what that was was the storage this is I just come from a top Marine

1415
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:24,159
This sad. You know they're cutting off the bushes money supply around the world

1416
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,719
You may remember that hospital was Bob in Syria

1417
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
What it really was

1418
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,071
Was a storage place of methamphetamines

1419
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,143
Billions of dollars worth of

1420
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
The world

1421
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
For the Bush family

1422
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,983
This is what I've Been Told

1423
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Cutting off

1424
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:54,111
Establishment in the bushes

1425
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:59,999
There is a underground Revolution

1426
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,303
So you suck

1427
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,631
Real

1428
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:11,263
A great source George facility for meth

1429
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,799
He didn't

1430
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
F******

1431
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,199
Jesus Christ man that was killed

1432
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
Warren.

1433
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
That they were there

1434
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,903
Is Without Borders

1435
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
Because

1436
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,791
Ostensibly they were treating

1437
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,095
Everybody fog of War

1438
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
F*** that

1439
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:41,727
F*** off but I want to point out more about this clip Beyond just that stupid

1440
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
This is

1441
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,335
This is indicative of Alex Jones's

1442
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Style

1443
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,663
Cuz what Mancow does is making outrageous

1444
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Is

1445
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,759
Trying to take out bushes money supply

1446
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,783
And so this

1447
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
Warcry

1448
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,855
My dad was actually

1449
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,927
Was actually taking out this methamphetamine

1450
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
Depot

1451
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Or whatever

1452
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:07,071
Now Alex

1453
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,607
I am getting on with the interview

1454
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
Say it

1455
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,215
Heading that way he allows the audience to

1456
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:13,983
The integrated

1457
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,263
Into their worldview

1458
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,847
Is plausible deniability so when anyone attacks him is like

1459
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:25,247
You think that's f****** hospital was a methamphetamine Depot I just let him stay that and I just agreed with

1460
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:30,623
Does all the time right now

1461
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:35,743
Cuz if Mancow was on our show any threat that we'd be like hold the f*** on

1462
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
We need more man details

1463
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
Now I want to work

1464
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
Alright

1465
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,623
Who turns out my show starting early tonight

1466
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,951
Imagine if anybody ever actually got prosecuted

1467
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
War crimes

1468
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:10,815
Be Wild

1469
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
Idaho

1470
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,847
Yeah it look if you do that you're going to have to excuse everybody

1471
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,639
It's going to start getting real bad

1472
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,431
But there has to be some sort of

1473
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,503
Consequence otherwise why do you think I just passed

1474
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:35,647
I think we talked about Eminem's come out later my beliefs on

1475
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,183
Aggressive taxation

1476
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
Millionaires

1477
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,999
But on top of that

1478
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
If we're actually going to

1479
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
The world

1480
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
We're going to have to do

1481
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,911
Is prosecute a lot of people for work right

1482
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,983
I think we're going to have to really deal with like

1483
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
Getting rid of this idea of American

1484
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Exceptionalism

1485
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,383
Like when we do it it's not that bad

1486
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,431
In order to get the

1487
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,735
Respective the world back

1488
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
Subway

1489
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,087
The idea that we were part of the world not above it

1490
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,695
I think that'll be necessary but also when we do if we ever do that

1491
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
One of these will have to do is

1492
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:11,999
Clemency

1493
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
In some way

1494
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,815
But go through the process and maybe

1495
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
Put people in prison

1496
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
Instead of kill

1497
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,191
Because it's just

1498
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,215
Become a part of being

1499
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
The president commits war crimes

1500
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,823
Which is what we have to ask

1501
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,175
Believable so I hope we will eventually get

1502
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:40,927
The end of the show and throughout Mancow just goes on to be like

1503
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:47,327
You're the best you're the best broadcaster ever I'd like to apologize for calling you crazy years ago August 12th

1504
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,887
Blah blah blah blah blah

1505
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,703
We move on to November

1506
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
Something

1507
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,079
Is it on each of these days

1508
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,871
We get a crazy guy

1509
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,663
So I know

1510
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:08,063
Yeah I'm at ansar little piece of chocolate with Mancow

1511
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
You will not believe

1512
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,415
What shows up on the 11th

1513
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,279
No but

1514
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,583
We will get there

1515
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
See his sad eyes

1516
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:27,775
I know when I will get there

1517
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,847
Nicholls State of the world because on the evening of November 10th

1518
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,895
Is a republican debate

1519
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,455
Right here is where Alex Jones

1520
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,759
About these politicians

1521
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
2015

1522
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,879
Amazing debates last night

1523
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:46,463
I got it last night

1524
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
Entirely

1525
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,447
Certainly was on last week

1526
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,239
Set my plan to it

1527
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,263
But

1528
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,319
And I have to say with probably one of the winners

1529
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:17,183
I watched last night

1530
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:24,095
Much better analysis than what we saw

1531
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,191
So it's Rand Paul was great in the debates but also we're pretty awesome

1532
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:32,799
Plug but the reason that's important live coverage of the debate

1533
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
It's so much better

1534
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Another debate

1535
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:40,223
You should watch our live coverage

1536
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
There we go

1537
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,039
Still supporting Rand Paul

1538
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,343
I don't know what the f*** is happening

1539
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
More

1540
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,647
This business masturbation is

1541
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Fuct

1542
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,207
Completely thought

1543
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:57,119
I don't even know what the I don't know what we're looking for anymore really just looking for him screaming 17th

1544
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,143
76 2.0

1545
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
Beyond

1546
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
Any

1547
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
Rand Paul

1548
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
Screaming

1549
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:09,151
Nepal is the messiah

1550
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,967
Right

1551
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
Trump is the

1552
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
Only savior

1553
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,807
The pivot has to come it's

1554
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,343
Some point

1555
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,391
It's got to have something to do with

1556
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,231
At this point it really feels

1557
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
It has to

1558
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,559
I don't know we'll see keep going

1559
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
But

1560
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,679
August 11th Alex gets back to the issues at Mizzou

1561
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,471
Because I think

1562
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
The 10th

1563
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,775
He may be done a little bit of reading

1564
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,567
They may be Googled some stuff

1565
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,615
Zoe

1566
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,431
Yes Mother Stephanie wants to talk about also

1567
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,735
I can't remember if it's in this clip or a later one

1568
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,527
He keeps calling it knees

1569
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
Mizzou is Mizu

1570
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,183
And it tells me something very important

1571
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,975
And that is

1572
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
Alex

1573
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,047
All of this information

1574
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,351
About what's going on at the University of Missouri

1575
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
From Paul Joseph Watson

1576
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,423
Because that is a British

1577
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Pronunciation

1578
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Of Mizzou

1579
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,495
And I know that

1580
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
Because later

1581
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,799
Call Joseph

1582
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,615
Show all the stuff that Alex

1583
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
Learning about this

1584
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
Is rum

1585
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,199
PJ dubs

1586
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,479
Ssj dub

1587
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
It's all filtered through

1588
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:25,183
That's we always do that

1589
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,815
Man I look I'm coming in hot.

1590
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:35,167
I'm bringing that into his racist narrative

1591
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,543
I love Columbia if there was a great home

1592
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,591
For me for many years

1593
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,871
Teen years that I live there

1594
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,407
Has a whole lot of problem

1595
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,687
But a whole lot of potential

1596
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,991
And go f*** yourself

1597
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Alex

1598
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
A butt

1599
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
The Mizu thing be figuring that out

1600
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,855
I felt so good about

1601
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,391
Cuz it's queer it's

1602
01:11:55,647 --> 01:12:01,279
We're that this is the cart leading the horse Paul Joseph Watson telling Alex what the broadcast

1603
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,095
Going to take the narrative

1604
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,887
Here on November 11th

1605
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,935
The situation

1606
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,495
Missouri State system

1607
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,567
Has just intensified

1608
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,663
Hunger strike

1609
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:24,831
Cuz over several weeks you didn't lose any weight

1610
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:33,535
Alex $8000000 a year year

1611
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:46,591
That's right I forgot

1612
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:57,087
I'm still double-checking it but it appears the railroad is parts or o sound

1613
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Of course

1614
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:09,887
You've already decided everything is that

1615
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
So

1616
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,775
I'm going to put this up on the the research documents

1617
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,383
Gone to Union Pacific Railroad is the company

1618
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:26,527
That Eric Butler is the guy's dad that's Jonathan Butler's dad

1619
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,855
At the time Vice

1620
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,135
Chief administrative officer

1621
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
Corporate

1622
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
But at the time

1623
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
He wasn't Executive Inn

1624
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
Sales and Mark

1625
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Fort Union

1626
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,303
Pacific Railroad

1627
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,863
Here we have the Directors & officers

1628
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:45,215
All the people who are involved we have the one thing that worries me

1629
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
Is that

1630
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,287
The one of the directors

1631
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,567
Is Andrew Card

1632
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,639
Who is the former Chief of Staff to GW bush

1633
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:58,783
Oh that's not good

1634
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,135
But if you look down this list I see no George Soros

1635
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
I see no one

1636
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,999
Who Alex has ever brought up who has explicit

1637
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,791
Anything like that

1638
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:14,143
Trail the directors officers

1639
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:14,911
Where to find Soros

1640
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
Members maybe the he's on a committee of some sort that has that control the audit committee

1641
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Coastal Finance

1642
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
Compensation and benefit

1643
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,711
Committee to corporate governance

1644
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:32,319
The nominating committee know George Soros Andrew card on a couple of these

1645
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,623
Which again is troubling to me

1646
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,159
Mabel doesn't necessarily prove any

1647
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,695
Cuz that is

1648
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,487
Government work

1649
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,767
Who knows

1650
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,303
Yeah but

1651
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,863
That is there's no Soros there so I looked

1652
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,751
Oh he was on Stocking Union Pacific Railroad

1653
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,775
Cuz you don't stop

1654
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,823
Everything

1655
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
Tons of money on the stock market

1656
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,383
He's a billionaire

1657
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,711
That if you want to play that game Alex

1658
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,759
Doing is essentially just

1659
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:06,879
I'm going to preemptively invalidate anyone who works at a company that sore ozone stopped

1660
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,439
Which is going to be trouble cuz that's almost

1661
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,463
Let me let the hundreds of

1662
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
The other thing is

1663
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
Sure

1664
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,095
Who's $8000000

1665
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Vinegar

1666
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,423
And now you're saying that his son

1667
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,447
Is not entitled

1668
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
Too political

1669
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Alex

1670
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,055
You are worth over 10 million

1671
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,615
If you want to use that argument

1672
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,455
If you want to use the argument how much your company brings in a year

1673
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,759
Which we can easily find out it's got to be

1674
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:40,159
As we know it's at least over 14 million dollars a year comes into Infowars cuz that's what he said

1675
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:48,351
He said that's what it takes to run it for a year so he has to be at least making that or more

1676
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,471
If you want to do that about Rex Jones

1677
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,311
Your thirteen-year-old son is not going to be entitled to political speech

1678
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,335
As an adult

1679
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
If he's on campus

1680
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,407
Something bad happen if you want

1681
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,943
Speak out about it

1682
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:08,575
Unfortunately what you're saying about valid argument against your dad makes millions of dollars

1683
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Go fuc yourself

1684
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:14,207
I understand that but

1685
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
It's important

1686
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
It doesn't

1687
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,863
Is it just doesn't matter pointing out hypocrisy anymore

1688
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,631
Thrilling to me

1689
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,167
Okay alright

1690
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:26,751
I'm not saying that that's going to

1691
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
Or anything like that right

1692
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
Cuz cuz

1693
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:35,455
Left about pointing out the hypocrisy

1694
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Clearing out these

1695
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
Attack

1696
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,551
That are being made on

1697
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
Necessarily on someone

1698
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,623
Who is just trying to

1699
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,391
Speak out

1700
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
How are you clearing up

1701
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,743
Because the attack is but his dad is made

1702
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,071
Blah blah blah

1703
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,863
Specious because

1704
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:58,751
Lots of people make millions of dollars and they're still entitled to their free speech

1705
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,287
To his dad's Railroad

1706
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
Jessie on Stocking

1707
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,735
So take any company that has OnStar

1708
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,295
Find out someone who's a marketing person

1709
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,063
That company

1710
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,183
I meant now their son isn't allowed to speak out because it is clearly a saurus operation

1711
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:25,887
Just tell amazing he's donated to Trump campaign so now Trump's children shouldn't be able to speak out

1712
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
They have Works business

1713
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
Altogether

1714
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,639
So

1715
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,943
It's less about

1716
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Apocracy

1717
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,039
And more about a style of argument called reductio ad absurdum

1718
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,575
Just take the logic

1719
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:50,719
Apply it to another situation where I seen things

1720
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
Probably

1721
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,767
Learning that logic

1722
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,327
Because I did his homework

1723
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,143
I should be clear I never accepted that offer

1724
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,799
It's just stupid idea some more stupidity about Missouri

1725
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
Hunger strike

1726
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,991
Father paid 8 million

1727
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,015
Has had

1728
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,599
Vice president of a major railroad last year

1729
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,183
He was paid a million net worth

1730
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
Guaranteed

1731
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
Indirect

1732
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,559
Guarantees

1733
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,375

Over media

1736
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:36,287
Pat's resign but she didn't really resign

1737
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,079
Trouble deceptive noise

1738
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:44,735
But at the same time I'm a bigger fan avoid avoid the deception

1739
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,575
Make me hungry

1740
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:54,463
I need more muscle professor

1744
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,143
Resigned

1745
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,423
Actual job

1746
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,263

1747
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,591
Doris Miller

1748
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,151
So yeah it's just more like

1749
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,687
This Is The Stuff work

1750
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
He's making

1751
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,503
He's just

1752
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,527
Making it up

1753
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,111
The idea that it's a story. I guarantee

1754
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,159
Immediately after this

1755
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
He transitions

1756
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:31,583
Do we know it's true

1757
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
Real-time there

1758
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,143
So now we get to work

1759
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,447
Everything he says

1760
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,239
He then confirm

1761
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,311
Himself I got it from source

1762
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
Earlier making s*** up

1763
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,503
But that one sounds good so now it's true

1764
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,295
I think I'm credible

1765
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
And if I said it

1766
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Credible source

1767
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,671

01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,215
General stubblebine

01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,775
May or may not have been a real General

1775
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,055
It's all important

1776
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,640

General stubblebine is on

1782
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744

01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,480
Prince between the two of them

1789
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,504
Whatever it's

01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,040
You live your life

1791
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,368

Gives to them

1799
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
And I got to say

1800
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
What they're on the show.

1801
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032

01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
F***** up

1803
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,080
But

1804
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
Deal with it

1805
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,920
And then we'll get to it awesome reveal at the end

1806
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
Okay

1807
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,880

I also have a whole section

1813
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,504
For your children

1815
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,632

01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,120
Fortunate

01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:49,120
Depression and suicide rates

Yep okay

1848
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,144
Signature

1849
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,424
Rate

1850
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,288
Years

1851
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,152
40 + 50

1852
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,784
World in terms of

1853
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:46,368
Remember to talk about whites

1854
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:51,488
White Jack White Privilege

1855
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,936
I don't think

1856
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,704
Statistics Arness

1857
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
Fairly accurate

1858
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,056
Sadistic

1859
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,456
So yeah this is the this is sort of the introduction of there but they're not really giving any

1860
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,272
Insight into what they're there to talk about

1861
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,808
Until this next

1862
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,880
Which is where we going to be at

1863
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,648
Stuff

1864
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,952
The end

1865
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,488
Clip is not to be believed

1866
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,792
So stupid

1867
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:30,144
One of the things

1868
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,288
United States

1869
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,872
Mortality rate

1870
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:45,248
Cousin facts

1871
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,808
Pause right there

1872
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:52,416
Statistics in front of me about tality rate is

1873
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,720
It's not because we have a

1874
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,256
Miserable

1875
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,304
Horrible Healthcare System

1876
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:04,448
Right here what's the divide an inch

1877
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,472
Mortality rates

1878
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,032
Is it

1879
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,592
The same infant mortality rate

1880
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,384
It seems as though

1881
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,224
Rich people have a much lower infant mortality

1882
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,504
Throat

1883
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,648
But I'm going to go to the document camera

1884
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,208
Cuz I have the infant mortality statistics

1885
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,744
From 2016 in front of me

1886
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,536
And what do you think she said was it

1887
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,096
Zimbabwe has a lower

1888
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,400
Here this is the infant mortality rate deaths

1889
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,936

01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,336
Terrifying

1895
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
10%

1896
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,152
But that's awful

1897
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,432
And then you get a ton of a

1898
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
Can countries

1899
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,040
Embalming

1900
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,368
We got all this

1901
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,160
So much Africa there

1902
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,696
This is all Africa because

1903
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,512
We have done a terrible job of helping them

1904
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,328
Zoe try there's a lot better things

1905
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,096
We should be doing

1906
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,400
Scroll down here we get through like

1907
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,448
There's a wreck there with 37

1908
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
5

1909
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,544
Still no America

1910
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,848
Like I passed them

1911
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,920
There's a 29

1912
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,712
For 1,000 live births

1913
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:21,760
This is from 2016 give my

1914
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:24,064
What is the most up-to-date information that is available

1915
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:29,184
Do you scroll down even though my God where are we there's the United States

1916
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
5.8

1917
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
This is just

1918
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,792
Complete cockamamie horseshit

1919
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
It's coming out of her mouth

1920
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,608
So where did it get there

1921
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,656
I hate vaccines

1922
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:43,008
Probably start probably Nan

1923
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,824
Probably just

1924
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,176
Some stuff where people got numbers wrong and their divisions or use bad sourcing

1925
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
I am the No 1

1926
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Corrected them

1927
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,272
You see this all the time and it's

1928
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,064
It's very common with Alex Jones is gas

1929
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:00,160
Unofficial things that were posted on blogs

1930
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:09,376
We're going to get him something really funny

1931
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:15,264
Also deny climate

1932
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,848
Great

1933
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,128
Highest

1934
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
Detection

1935
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,832
I would call the facts

1936
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,720
Accelerating rate

1937
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:42,144
The introduction of

1938
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
Enzyme

1939
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
Carter the Great

1940
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,336
Calling how is it introduced

1941
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,920
Baby

1942
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,320
Is never ever again

1943
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,232
Oh boy

1944
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:15,936
California

1945
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
This is bad

1946
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,456
But I want to assure you the only way to stop

1947
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,480
The Great Khali

1948
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,784
Vaccine right

1949
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,856
Somebody and allowing smallpox

1950
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:38,720
Another calling

1951
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,512
Smallpox dozen

1952
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,792
Dyathon race

1953
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,632
But I will.

1954
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,168
With a straight face day

1955
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
Privilege

1956
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,216
White males are dying

1957
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:50,752
And just end

1958
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,384
So inherently racist

1959
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,224
If you've got nothing it's easy to leave it there cuz you don't want to dwell on it

1960
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,016
Come on like

1961
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,856
Jordan care about males are dying

1962
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:09,184
Number one issue again all of these guests

1963
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
I'm so much with Alex Jones

1964
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,768
The show is really about

1965
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:15,584
Is retaining undeserved Social Power

1966
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:16,608
And privileged

1967
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,144
That's what threatened

1968
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:21,984
That's why he is white identity theft

1969
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,752
She's not a race

1970
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
That

1971
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,848
The infertility

1972
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:30,176
The forced infertility or whatever it is that's the big one

1973
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:37,600
There's some of that are running out

1974
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,648
Meredith

1975
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
A butt

1976
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,208
Look all this stuff is tough

1977
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,232
It's stupid

1978
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,512
Trust me

1979
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,048
The end of this clip

1980
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,840
In about a minute and a half

1981
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
Hilarious

1982
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,192
And we find out why they're really on the show

1983
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,568
To informed consent

1984
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,664
Where's my Samsung

1985
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,968
Fifth

1986
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,648
So just a pause real quick at this point

1987
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:15,232
She's holding up a card to the video screen that's important

1988
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,304
Is this your card

1989
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,096
The trumps

1990
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:27,520
We got to get organized

1991
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:39,040
Doesn't work

1992
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:46,720
Videos on the news in Mexico

1993
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,512
A bunch of

1994
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:51,328
This is really testing how much will put up with

1995
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:55,680
Albert Wilson

1996
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,728
Determine how much will put up with

1997
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,032
Anything they want to give up

1998
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
No

1999
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,736
And you're kind of right

2000
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,760
Diana Ross

2001
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:13,600
Legal format

2002
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,368
Next

2003
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,696
Deserting your informed consent right

2004
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,768
You going to get back

2005
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
Created

2006
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:30,752
To everyone

2007
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,848
Splash the prices

2008
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:39,968
Everyone can afford it help everyone

2009
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,856
Backpack in Europe

2010
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:48,928
Wallet in your purse

2011
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,488
That bright

2012
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:04,544
Vaccine if you don't assert specific legal language that is only available on this card

2013
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,128
That we happened to spell and we slashed prices

2014
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
You can't just

2015
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:13,248
I don't know print out a ton of lemon lemonade

2016
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:17,856
Have gone to her website doctor rimas website

2017
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,720
Exemption card that she

2018
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,536
She sells on her website is $30

2019
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,400
If you scroll up

2020
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:37,056
Clarify our website

2021
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,336
That is the store

2022
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,616
$30

2023
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:43,712
For a card you can print out that says I don't want to get jabbed

2024
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,760
Wow

2025
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:54,976
Death General stubblebine f****** real becoming clear to me at least in the

2026
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,768
This but this is all

2027
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:03,168
Rema this is the lady found a two-year-old supporting

2028
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,728
And

2029
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,848
I can do this forever to get you on Alex

2030
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,640
His show of certainly

2031
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,504
1

2032
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,784
Really doesn't say anything

2033
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:22,112
All of these military credits

2034
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,416
For her to just jump

2035
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
Here's what you got to do

2036
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:30,048
He says a little bit more that I cut out but it's all kind of boring stuff

2037
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,584
Sadistic fly

2038
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,352
Align

2039
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:36,448
What language

2040
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,472
Do you need to use

2041
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,752
Legal

2042
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,736
But that's another one of those libertarian like

2043
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:55,136
It's all about the maritime law do exactly

2044
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:59,232
So that's the end of their interview butts

2045
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:09,472
And if you really feel like you're a f****** child

2046
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,008
If you really look into it

2047
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,336
Informed consent just means

2048
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:16,128
You signed a form that says

2049
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,408
Do you know the risk

2050
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:21,504
And you reject them knowing the risk

2051
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,320
Fatality for doctors hospital today

2052
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:27,904
When you reject the vaccine

2053
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,464
So if you want to get evacs

2054
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,768
They have to ask the question

2055
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,816
Like are you sure you're aware of it

2056
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,864
If you signed forms As You Are

2057
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
That's plenty

2058
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:43,520
They won't Force vaccinate after that point situation

2059
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
Can't like

2060
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,848
I don't know become a daycare worker if you're not vaccinate

2061
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:53,504
Goddamn right your situation. That's just like

2062
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,320
It's within their rights to not allow you in

2063
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,368
That's the consequence of your choice

2064
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:03,232
Utah business

2065
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,048
The only sign that I would have

2066
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,328
No answer

2067
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
No need apply

2068
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
Sup

2069
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,472
Let's get out to be fully vaccinated

2070
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:17,056
To work here

2071
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
Let's jump

2072
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,384
UPS drop off the exit bag stuff

2073
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,432
Cuz we talked about it too much

2074
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,200
Like

2075
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:27,040
This is fun because they they go from vaccines cause autism

2076
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,088
M2

2077
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,160
Throat

2078
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,816
They're done

2079
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
At this point

2080
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,632
But Alex wants to get back into

2081
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,680
To the last night's debate and how great

2082
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:44,960
Crazy

2083
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,544
So this is about how great Rand Paul was last night

2084
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,592
And then Alex Jones says something

2085
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,872
Little unfortunate that is

2086
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,176
With our

2087
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,832
It'll put me come out instead of pure Bowl

2088
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,648
And it's a military operation by the globalist

2089
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:12,608
Peter Popoff

2090
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,800
Activity contributed to climate change

2091
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,360
I wanted to stop right there today

2092
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:26,432
You've made too much sense to be on this stage

2093
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:30,016
I want to say that most sensible version of insane

2094
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,136
Closer

2095
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:38,208
Two reasonable but also I hate

2096
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:42,560
So what's good with the sweet with the sour

2097
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,584
Smooth

2098
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:49,216
President Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions

2099
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
At the same time

2100
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,568
Energy production

2101
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,152
To continue this

2102
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:00,224
And energy self-sufficiency

2103
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,760
The same time

2104
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,576
Pursuing a meaningful climate change program

2105
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:11,232
That's a really good question as president is repeal the regulations

2106
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:16,608
Fat ugly

2107
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,960
Well I do think you may have a role in our climate

2108
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:27,360
I think nature also has a role

2109
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:33,760
Magic we've had time to the temperature been warmer we had times when the temperatures been cold we've had times when the carbon

2110
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,296
Any atmosphere has been higher

2111
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,856
So I think we need to look for

2112
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:41,952
Presidents are often fond of Steve

2113
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:47,072
We do need to balance both keeping the environment clean

2114
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,864
Where to balance that with the economy

2115
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,912
He's devastated mistake

2116
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:57,056
I say the president only just joined Kentucky he's destroying the Democrat Party down there cuz nobody wants to associate with him

2117
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:02,176
Really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms

2118
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,272
That means we will have solar and wind

2119
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,344
Natural Gas

2120
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:12,160
We've got to have an all-of-the-above party

2121
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,488
False

2122
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:19,840
Coal power plants in the United States

2123
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,776
Insider companies

2124
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:35,200
Really trouble

2125
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,992
Sure

2126
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,624
With these guys like with Mancow and him is it just like big swinging dick

2127
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,440
Looks like they just like a guy who just says whatever you want

2128
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,720
And then does whatever

2129
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:51,072
Guy who says

2130
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,352
And then acts like

2131
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:56,192
Equation

2132
01:40:56,448 --> 01:41:00,032
To see that they're trying to live out through these guys like they're always here

2133
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:06,432
Oh there's all these people telling me what I can do what I just want to do whatever I want to do whenever I want

2134
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,736
I hate the clicker f***************

2135
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:15,904
People who bow down and grovel

2136
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:20,000
What is attractive to them about

2137
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:22,304
Unattractive

2138
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,120
But we gotta move through this

2139
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:31,520
Cuz you have a hard out to get to yourself

2140
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,544
Yeah Christ

2141
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
So

2142
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,104
Here are we get

2143
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,664
To November 12th the last day of our invest

2144
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,432
Navigation

2145
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,992
And at this point Alex's

2146
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,272
I'm keenly aware

2147
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:44,576
At the Paris climate Accord is coming up

2148
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:49,696
Figured it out the Summit is coming up and he realizes he needs to make that the narrative

2149
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:51,744
Global government

2150
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,584
Being created in public absolute and so he's going to jump on

2151
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,888
To that narrative pretty hard

2152
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:58,912
But

2153
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:02,240
He does that in a really weird way

2154
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,032
Because I listen to this clip

2155
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:06,080
About his climate change denial

2156
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:09,920
And try and figure out or try and listen for where it's different from things

2157
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
You said in the past

2158
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,880
Exxon

2159
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,648
Mobile

2160
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,512
And British Petroleum

2161
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:27,072
Dutch Royal shell

2162
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,120
Are the biggest

2163
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,144
Thunders

2164
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
Call man-made

2165
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,728
Climate change

2166
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,872
And they're so sophisticated

2167
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,016
ExxonMobil

2168
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:54,720
It wasn't that was 15 years ago

2169
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:59,328
Rockefeller

2170
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,264
Incredible in the sense that it's not credible

2171
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
But

2172
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,568
So wait he saying that

2173
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
Oil

2174
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,128
Funding climate

2175
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
Search or not

2176
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,272
Doing something about it

2177
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,040
In order to

2178
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,576
Takedown col-rite

2179
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,368
Why does he want cool so

2180
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,904
Because he

2181
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,952
He believes that it is like a

2182
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,488
The most plentiful

2183
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,024
Source of energy

2184
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,584
How are the planet for the next Thousand Years

2185
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,656
And the technology that we have is totally clean now it's

2186
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:39,776
It's not totally lying about that

2187
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,824
Here's the problem

2188
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,872
What should we do know is that

2189
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,152
Knew that climate

2190
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,224
Contributing to 30 years ago

2191
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,760
And lied about it

2192
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,064
And I just lied about it

2193
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,600
Pulled a full-on nicotine

2194
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
And we're like

2195
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:59,232
Doctors

2196
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,000
Call Klim

2197
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:03,840
Climate change study

2198
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,888
Climate change is denying study

2199
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:09,984
Concepcion the clip Adidas put out there they paid for

2200
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,824
Climate change positive studies in order to take out cold

2201
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,104
Which doesn't make sense

2202
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,920
It does not reflect reality

2203
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:21,504
But the more important thing in the reason that clip is fascinating to me

2204
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:22,528
Is because it's

2205
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,808
Not what he usually

2206
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,624
He's saying that the climate change lie

2207
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,392
In his mind

2208
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:30,208
Is being put out by British Petroleum

2209
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,768
By beating all those the companies he listed

2210
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,792
Shell

2211
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,352
And those in order to take out Cole

2212
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,888
In the past

2213
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:40,192
His frequent narrative is better to be

2214
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:42,240
The UN that is doing this

2215
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,800
In order to get climate credit

2216
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,360
Inclimate carbon

2217
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,896
Is going in order to

2218
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
Cut off energy

2219
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:53,760
Do the third world in what-have-you it's completely different

2220
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,576
Everybody runs in he's got Rockefeller

2221
01:44:57,088 --> 01:45:00,160
Dropping them trying to put those

2222
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,696
Rockefeller is 1

2223
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,256
Right but it's not the same

2224
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,048
Very different

2225
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,840
Goals or storyline

2226
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
Pitching in Chinese

2227
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,912
What climate change is about it

2228
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
It's f****** stupid

2229
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:17,056
It's certainly not buddy

2230
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:17,824
Tibet

2231
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,432
People at Mizzou

2232
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,992
He wants to get into protester

2233
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,296
I believe it's called

2234
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,904
He says something bad about them

2235
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,928
And then something

2236
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,464
Exculpatory

2237
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,000
About a different

2238
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,024
That is very

2239
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:42,144
And then I sat there

2240
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:46,496
3-4 hours watching the video

2241
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,520
I don't believe you did

2242
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,384
Others

2243
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:59,296
Really screwed up damage

2244
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,064
Victims

2245
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:03,136
Above of re-education Camp brainwash

2246
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,720
When I heard that the clan

2247
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,560
What's going to show up at the universe

2248
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:18,240
The federally-run clan of times there's usually about six or seven guys

2249
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,800
It comes out later that day

2250
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,408
Maybach

2251
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,480
It's a photo album the racial tension

2252
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:34,368
Center and other groups behind

2253
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:38,976
SPS

2254
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:44,096
Would be saying

2255
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,728
Running in fear

2256
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:51,776
Is it true

2257
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,592
Is the clan here are we safe

2258
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,384
And they cancel classes

2259
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,480
Had the police on alert that me SWAT team on the road

2260
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
I don't believe that

2261
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,808
It was all completely made up

2262
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:07,904
But meanwhile the very same football players and basketball players

2263
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,560
I don't I don't believe that there were like snipers on roof

2264
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,840
At all

2265
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
Anytime

2266
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:24,032
Scandalous rumors

2267
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,056
Salaciousness

2268
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:32,992
And that's unfortunate that he's sort of the problem of the social turning a

2269
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,296
Yes they are coming and show

2270
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
We are not

2271
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:41,696
I'm sure that they fed into it a little bit I know I am

2272
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,488
I also know that the clan

2273
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,256
Does not run

2274
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:48,864
First they're all true

2275
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:53,728
But you understand what he's doing he's taking the agency power away from these protests

2276
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,776
They are brainwashing

2277
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,544
Victims of

2278
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:03,968
Center

2279
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:06,272
To provoke

2280
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:12,672
So black people black people standing up for themselves

2281
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:16,000
Wasn't pointing out institutional problems

2282
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:18,816
White racism not really real it's just

2283
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,400
Right that's what he thinks

2284
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
That's what he thinks

2285
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,776
And unfortunately even in that narrative

2286
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,336
White people run the government

2287
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,384
Mostly

2288
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,176
So even that is Raisa

2289
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:38,272
Even that that does not justify his position on it

2290
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,600
Not really you're right that's an interesting

2291
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,648
Argument that would be fun to point out to her

2292
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,952
I think it would I think it would end up in

2293
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,000
Yeah probably I would assume

2294
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:50,560
I want to jump into the next load cuz

2295
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,328
This is one of my favorites

2296
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:54,400
Alex Jones was a victim

2297
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,424
Throwing up

2298
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,216
He was a complete victim

2299
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:03,104
We've never known what it was exactly that

2300
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,920
And on this November 12th

2301
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:06,944
No

2302
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:07,968
It is not

2303
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:10,272
That is not something you could ever predict

2304
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,832
I seen the statistics

2305
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:18,208
A person is collapsing

2306
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,512
Have no idea what's going on

2307
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:25,120
Some shells

2308
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,912
And hear from you

2309
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:31,264
My racism

2310
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,848
Privilege all this crap

2311
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,760
Images being singled out because I was so good looking

2312
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,976
Show me the photos online

2313
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,216
Mencken

2314
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:04,032
I thought they were to kick my butt

2315
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,152
I think that it's it's it's likely that he was an a******

2316
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:11,200
But also if that was

2317
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:12,480
True which it isn't

2318
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:18,880
He was attractive

2319
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,672
But if it was

2320
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:23,744
You're making a

2321
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,512
Compelling case

2322
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:25,536
About the

2323
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,328
Evils of toxic masculinity

2324
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:34,496
Cuz if you had to fight men who didn't like that you were pretty and all the women wanted you

2325
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:40,384
You are entirely embodying

2326
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,664
Masculine

2327
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,432
Threatened

2328
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,736
Maelstrom

2329
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,504
Bulshit

2330
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:51,904
If you're saying that you are an animal bright

2331
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,208
Mr. Steal Your Girl

2332
01:50:56,256 --> 01:51:02,400
You're one step away from understanding if you really believe that that is what happened

2333
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:05,728
Close close

2334
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,288
And it gets worse

2335
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:09,824
I fixed it all

2336
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:15,712
Slack-jawed snot-nosed Punk

2337
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,624
Is

2338
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,184
And Warren Buffett

2339
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,488
Point two million

2340
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:44,640
Accomplish anything on your own is a load of bull

2341
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,664
You're projecting

2342
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:58,464
I want to help

2343
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:02,048
All these people I understand metaphysically spiritual

2344
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:09,728
What you are

2345
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:15,360
I would want others to succeed because I understand you reap what yourself the problem is evil people

2346
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:18,944
Don't understand that metaphysical Rule and they want to see others fail

2347
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:23,040
What other people say

2348
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,064
Oh boy

2349
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,368
About Rush Limbaugh

2350
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:32,512
Right every other Media Company all the time

2351
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:34,560
That everybody else is

2352
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:37,120
Terrible and he's only one

2353
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:43,520
61%

2354
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,288
Batshit

2355
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,456
He's not just an evil person

2356
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:53,504
He's a bad person in this

2357
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,088
Now you're pointing out of pocket

2358
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,208
Calling you after your own s***

2359
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:07,072
Fair enough comes a bit angry tone

2360
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:13,472
And now I'm angry about it back onto the climate stuff

2361
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,008
But here is a

2362
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:15,776
Classic

2363
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,360
That's one of our

2364
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,152
That's another one of those visuals you need to make

2365
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,248
Cliff is

2366
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,040
Alota bulshit

2367
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:32,672
And Alex accidentally proves that's a load of bull s*** on a minute later

2368
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,464
News about Lord monckton

2369
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:38,560
The guy who Alex Jones I believe is the only real climate scientist

2370
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,328
Disney World

2371
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,912
Climate

2372
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,704
Lord in front of

2373
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:50,080
If climate change of Advocates get there it will kill a billion people

2374
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,384
Six months or something like that

2375
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
That's his ark

2376
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,432
Lord monckton

2377
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:55,968
That Alex always sites

2378
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,504
Listen to Lorde

2379
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,784
Speak he does not get into

2380
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:03,392
He claims he's gone through every climate change

2381
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
Study

2382
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,464
And found underlying asset

2383
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,744
But they have wrong

2384
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,512
Adventure

2385
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,048
But

2386
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:13,632
Here is the b******* that Alex has to say about Lord Market

2387
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,240
And I disagree with

2388
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,032
I don't even know if he's a lord

2389
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:24,384
But so hear this

2390
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,408
He's probably not an ass

2391
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,968
This is about Lord Boston's relation

2392
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,992
To the climate

2393
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,296
Sapulpa okay

2394
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:32,320
Virgo

2395
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,728
Can Paris

2396
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,672
Intuit

2397
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:09,952
Never stop

2398
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:16,096
Doesn't doesn't

2399
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,120
South Africa

2400
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:25,312
Is the same bulb

2401
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:30,688
Yeah that small town country

2402
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:36,576
Absolutely that's what we need from you daring stunts

2403
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:41,696
All you listeners go parachute into places do you have not parachuted before that is actually true

2404
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,976
Lord mantra

2405
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,840
Confirm or deny

2406
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:49,888
Alex Jones

2407
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:55,520
Is saying that Lord monckton and others are being threatened to not even show up in Paris

2408
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,800
Don't come don't even

2409
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,384
Walk into the city

2410
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,456
Persona non grata

2411
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,224
This point

2412
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,760
One of his interns

2413
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
Google

2414
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,576
The climate change

2415
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,600
The chords in Paris

2416
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:11,136
And the alicorns

2417
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,280
Usual Suspects

2418
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,096
Felipe Calderon

2419
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,288
Lord monckton

2420
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:35,968
Foot Locker

2421
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,272
God

2422
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:44,928
Pause was beautiful Alex Jones accidentally learns on air

2423
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:48,000
Invited

2424
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:50,048
Did he have papers up Gunn

2425
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:57,472
No cuz the the intern had the UN website open that has the list and all the pictures of the

2426
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:00,800
Rolling sky

2427
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:04,896
Oh no Lord monckton oh no

2428
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:11,296
I just said a minute ago that he's being threatened about the UN was

2429
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:24,096
Is somebody at the door very light knock at the door there

2430
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,424
I don't know if I can hear it

2431
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,288
You are bad attacks

2432
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:35,360
Valley Construction

2433
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:37,664
Retired

2434
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,712
I know

2435
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:42,016
I don't know why you ever started

2436
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,296
I just like saying

2437
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,320
You're busted

2438
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,344
You're busted

2439
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,392
So after this point

2440
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,160
He gets back on to

2441
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:48,928
The race issues

2442
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,464
Alex

2443
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,256
Accidentally

2444
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Everything by ax

2445
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:56,096
But he accidentally revealed

2446
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,120
Huge race

2447
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,400
Bye

2448
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,448
Complaining about racism

I can choose

2452
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:44,736
Well assured that I cannot

2453
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,976
We are

2454
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,192
Smooth

2455
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:11,104
I can do all of these things like that doesn't seem to be a problem that like can I speak

2456
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:17,504
Speak to people without putting my race on then I get flesh-colored

2457
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,040
Are they the same color is my

2458
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:25,696
Colors

2459
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,488
This checklist should up on

2460
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,536
Camera

2461
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:35,168
I can accompany of people my race

2462
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,192
Most of the time

2463
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:42,592
I can't turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely represented

2464
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,664
What I'm told about our National Heritage or civilization

2465
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,968
I'm showing the people of my color made it what it is

2466
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,040
I can be sure that my children will be given quickly

2467
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:52,832
Exist

2468
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:53,600
Sense of their race

2469
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:56,928
It goes on like

2470
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,464
Whether I use check

2471
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,744
Credit cards or cash

2472
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,560
I can count on my skin color not to work against

2473
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:03,584
The appearance of fine

2474
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,120
Reliability

2475
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,912
So

2476
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:08,960
Is a list of things

2477
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:09,984
That white people

2478
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,776
Take for granted about their daily existence

2479
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:14,336
People who aren't white have to deal with

2480
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,872
This is the conversation

2481
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:18,432
That people haven't when they talk about white privilege

2482
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,712
Edit should be the one that

2483
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:22,272
Everybody right it's so fascinating

2484
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,040
To me that Alex

2485
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,320
Is furious about there so he

2486
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,088
He pulls up

2487
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:29,184
Doesn't understand the premise

2488
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:32,256
You nailed it whistle

2489
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,536
So in advance

2490
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:36,608
Approving every single thing

2491
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:42,496
That everybody's 1000% making their art

2492
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,312
You are embodying

2493
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:47,616
The problem

2494
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,176
Going to guess

2495
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,248
East in terms of that Band-Aid

2496
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,016
He just didn't know

2497
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:55,040
Understand what it was

2498
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:57,088
I'm going to guess in that case but with the

2499
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:59,392
Speaking without electric power.

2500
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
My race on

2501
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:02,976
Like not engaging

2502
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,256
With the idea at all

2503
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:05,536
It's just

2504
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:07,584
Oh yeah I guess I do

2505
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:12,960
That is interesting I do single out all the

2506
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:15,520
All the people who were black

2507
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
Speaking up

2508
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,848
I got to re-examine

2509
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:20,640
Is that just like

2510
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,688
The idea that he

2511
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:23,456
He's there he's

2512
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,736
He's like of course I can

2513
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,528
And you can't do that

2514
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,088
Like there's one step a little bit

2515
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:29,856
Further

2516
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,392
Can everyone

2517
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,928
Right right

2518
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,952
Process that

2519
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:34,720
Second Quest

2520
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:38,560
That is the idea

2521
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:40,096
Answer these questions

2522
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,376
Guess what

2523
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,400
These are things

2524
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,168
Other people

2525
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,728
Do other people

2526
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:46,496
Do them

2527
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,520
You can

2528
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,544
That

2529
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Privilege

2530
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:58,016
His response would be like I don't believe they can't do it it's all a bunch of media soros-funded Foundation

2531
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,296
Bulshit

2532
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:01,600
It's all a bunch of course you can do the thing

2533
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:04,160
Cuz he doesn't want to engage with anyone else's

2534
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,464
Well yeah but I mean the flesh colored Bandit

2535
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:07,488
Seems pretty

2536
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,792
That's why you can't understand

2537
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,584
That's so obvious

2538
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:16,192
That's that's

2539
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,472
Mount Jordan

2540
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:18,752
We reached today is crazy

2541
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,544
It's time for The Gap

2542
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,824
On the November 12th

2543
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:24,896
This guy is one of my favorite crazy

2544
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:31,040
Rogues gallery of Alex Jones's Associated team of weirdos

2545
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,344
This guy is up there

2546
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:38,208
Top-level weirdo

2547
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:39,744
Professor Darrell hamamoto

2548
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,536
He is a teacher

2549
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:45,376
A professor at the University of California at Davis

2550
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,424
Sometimes

2551
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,704
That what happened

2552
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,472
Was

2553
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:50,752
He got crazy

2554
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,032
At a certain point

2555
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:54,848
Because

2556
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:57,408
I can't imagine they don't want to get rid of him

2557
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,944
And they never would have hired him

2558
02:02:59,200 --> 02:02:59,712
Induced currents

2559
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:03,808
Darrell hamamoto is a very interesting

2560
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,856
Historically

2561
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:09,440
I'm not sure what he teaches now although I think so

2562
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:10,208
Conspiracy

2563
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:11,232
But

2564
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:14,048
He originally came into his own

2565
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,120
And was a professor in Asian American studies

2566
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,656
Specifically inter

2567
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,680
Terms of sexuality

2568
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:21,216
He wrote a couple books

2569
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,752
About the desexualization

2570
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,520
Of the Asia

2571
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,312
Hey there's an interest

2572
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:26,848
Conversation

2573
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,688
Because I don't want to

2574
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:31,712
But

2575
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:33,760
I do think that there that's an interest

2576
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:38,624
Exactly that's on the timer

2577
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:46,560
Showed up on Alex Jones Show and we covered him in a past episode

2578
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,608
Episode

2579
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,888
Justin Gould

2580
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,240
I need you to listen

2581
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,008
Into this

2582
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:58,592
Clip from

2583
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,616
Is this

2584
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,640
Is worth Rivas

2585
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:10,368
Well

2586
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,160
Here is one of our

2587
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:12,928
Solutions

2588
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,464
We're going to use the Fowler

2589
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,488
Guitars

2590
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,608
Cypress happens to be

2591
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:25,216
Offender a Squier guitar

2592
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,752
Warrior rally

2593
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:29,056
With my little friend

2594
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:49,280
Esquire my pudenda pink Esquire

2595
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:54,656
And they wouldn't let me sit in a said I'm sorry can't let it happen

2596
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,496
And they were hired this is part of the

2597
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:00,800
Cultural takeover

2598
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:02,080
So that's

2599
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:07,712
Yamamoto

2600
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:10,528
Interested

2601
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:12,320
Hip-hop and punk is propaganda

2602
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,344
Yeah but they're trying to

2603
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:16,160
Inculcate in the minds of the freshman

2604
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:17,696
And

2605
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,488
He brought you

2606
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:20,512
Hit funk

2607
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:22,560
Bright

2608
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:27,680
Chips 02 trailer

2609
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:31,264
I'll tell you let me get on a second

2610
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:37,664
He brings his gay pick to play with

2611
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,992
I think I think it was probably cuz he's like

2612
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,784
60 year old dude

2613
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,064
Know your f******

2614
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:53,792
Every campus has

2615
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:59,168
And I was thinking about it like I'm certain that he got hired when he was writing these books about Asian-American

2616
02:05:59,424 --> 02:05:59,936
Bi-sexual

2617
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:03,520
Classes on this

2618
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:05,824
Then he went crazy

2619
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:08,640
And they're in too deep they can't fire at

2620
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:09,664
So

2621
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,968
I was thinking back on my college experience

2622
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,296
And I had a human sexuality Professor named Joe Lopez

2623
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,064
Piccolo

2624
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,344
And

2625
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:21,440
He clearly was a very

2626
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,208
Smart

2627
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:22,976
Interesting

2628
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:26,048
Good speaker good teacher

2629
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:27,072
In the seventies

2630
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,352
And then he had a

2631
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,120
Stroke

2632
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:31,168
And when I had him it would pass

2633
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:31,936
Stroke

2634
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:34,240
You could barely speak in lectures

2635
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,520
And he was

2636
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,056
Very ineffective

2637
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:37,824
Professor

2638
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,104
But I realized

2639
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,128
This is after you'd left

2640
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:42,944
What's Goku

2641
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:48,064
Oceanside methadone

2642
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:58,816
The point of getting at is like when you're tenured it's very difficult to get rid of

2643
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:01,632
Until Joe lopiccolo wood watch

2644
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:03,168
Retire they wouldn't be able to

2645
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:03,936
Get rid of him

2646
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:04,960
Even though

2647
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:07,264
Like you play videos of himself

2648
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,032
In class

2649
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:08,800
From

2650
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:12,128
Years past whenever he clearly different

2651
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:14,432
Turn speaker very articulate

2652
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,456
Incredibly sad

2653
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,224
To be in that class

2654
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:19,040
It made me a baby a size with him a lot

2655
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:19,808
It was

2656
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:23,904
The most tragic day in class he put up a slide on the projector

2657
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,464
The show the graph

2658
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,536
Breakdown of grades

2659
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,584
In the class and almost everyone was saying

2660
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:37,216
What's going on we don't understand what you're saying

2661
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:39,008
It was so tragic

2662
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:43,616
And less tragic level Darrell hamamoto clearly went nuts

2663
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:46,944
I started to think about like a

2664
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:47,712
Globalist

2665
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,480
Stuff like out

2666
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:51,552
What's the Illuminati have you and now there's

2667
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,600
We can't get rid of him until he retires

2668
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:54,624
I think it is something

2669
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,648
Men at like

2670
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,672
Around 40

2671
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:04,608
Just started to get into globalist like they the old saying is like a

2672
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:05,376
If your

2673
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:06,912
Not a liberal when you're

2674
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:08,192
20 you have no heart

2675
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:08,960
Nautica

2676
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,008
You have no bra

2677
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,568
I'm thrilled to report that my dad is

2678
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,848
Now it is 60s

2679
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:17,920
Still going strong and I are good old liberal

2680
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:19,712
Right

2681
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:21,248
Religious studies

2682
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:23,808
Texas

2683
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,112
Anyway

2684
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:26,880
Pink Pussycat

2685
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:30,464
Pink

2686
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,232
So

2687
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,768
Hamamoto comes in

2688
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:36,352
On the show

2689
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:38,144
Because of all the craziness

2690
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,680
What's going on on campus

2691
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:42,240
Mizzou it also brings up Yale

2692
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:47,104
Cuz Gail they had that situation where students were mad about races Halloween

2693
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,152
Alex

2694
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:51,968
But

2695
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:53,248
Hamamoto in

2696
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,296
A present him as a whistleblower

2697
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:56,576
Because

2698
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:58,368
Darrell hamamoto

2699
02:08:58,624 --> 02:09:00,160
I'd like a Rockefeller Grant

2700
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,440
Or something like that

2701
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,512
He's gone through some sort of

2702
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,792
Indoctrination

2703
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:07,072
From The Rock

2704
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:08,352
Stellar Foundation

2705
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:10,144
And that that makes him like

2706
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,424
He knows inside

2707
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,192
Stop

2708
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,728
When the reality is

2709
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,520
The Rockefeller Grant

2710
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:17,568
The Ford Foundation grants

2711
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:18,592
Are just

2712
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,872
Things that are given out to

2713
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:20,896
Apply for

2714
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:22,688
And they are there

2715
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,224
To create diversity

2716
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,248
And University

2717
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:30,112
Hamamoto almost certainly got one of these grants

2718
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:31,136
Because he was

2719
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:31,904
Pursuing

2720
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:32,928
An Avenue of study

2721
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,696
That would

2722
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:35,232
Be incredibly advantageous

2723
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,000
Stewie universe

2724
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:40,352
Maybe they wouldn't have the budget to pay him threat so the grant comes in

2725
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,632
And other Foundation

2726
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:43,680
Hey is that part of this

2727
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:44,704
Professor salary

2728
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,240
Brett if you look into it

2729
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:49,056
Hans of organizations like this

2730
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:50,080
Including

2731
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,360
The Koch brothers

2732
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:54,688
Have their own Foundation that gives out grants

2733
02:09:55,968 --> 02:10:00,320
Right there is a fellowship at the University of Missouri that for years and years was under

2734
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:02,368
1.1 million

2735
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,136
Dollars

2736
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:03,904
Was given

2737
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,464
To pay for a professor salary

2738
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,000
By Kenneth lay

2739
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:08,768
From Enron

2740
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:09,536
Call Mike

2741
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:11,584
Because he went to the University of Missouri

2742
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:14,400
Fred.

2743
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:16,704
S*** I think someone did a

2744
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:23,104
I got the Enron scholarship guys don't worry about it it's all good for professors

2745
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,408
I think someone did end up taking it

2746
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,736
Yeah but it's okay

2747
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:32,576
Years for someone to do that be that Craven to Taco

2748
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,600
Do you want to have some

2749
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:35,136
Distance between Bellevue and

2750
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:37,952
The greatest game ever pulled off let me be clear

2751
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,400
The great so are they still around

2752
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:53,056
Alex Jones believes Daryl hamamoto to be a whistleblower of the inside of the Ford Foundation

2753
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,824
And all that

2754
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,104
Haha

2755
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:57,152
But Alex Jones

2756
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:58,688
Treat him like a whistleblower

2757
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,224
I'd like he is

2758
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,504
Preaching the gospel

2759
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,040
Where is as We Know

2760
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:06,112
He wants to bring a guitar to Occupy Wall Street

2761
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:09,184
And jam with the guys

2762
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:11,488
He's going to say a bunch

2763
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:13,536
Radically stupid stuff

2764
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:16,096
In this let's just jump into it

2765
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:19,424
Like you're saying it is a program

2766
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:22,496
The students are on Electro Pharmaceutical

2767
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:28,896
And it's it's no accident that whatever can't she go to it's the same program it's the same scenario

2768
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:33,504
You have a shot

2769
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,552
Sandy Hook

2770
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:39,648
Baseball game

2771
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:42,464
Do you got the Soros connected

2772
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:55,008
Hook was Crisis actors Alex signed off on that so clearly he's not pushing back

2773
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:58,080
You believe this is not absolute

2774
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:58,848
You have

2775
02:11:59,104 --> 02:11:59,872
This

2776
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:02,688
What we started the show off with

2777
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:03,968
Where Alex is saying

2778
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:05,248
Maybe

2779
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:07,040
There's Soros connection

2780
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:10,880
We're going to look into it he's reporting it just as gospel without proving

2781
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:12,416
So I mean

2782
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:13,184
It's just nonsense

2783
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:13,952
But

2784
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:18,816
Get back to hamamoto

2785
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:28,544
Earlier

2786
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:30,336
There's a certain

2787
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:36,736
Standard shipping

2788
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:43,136
Sexuality

2789
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:49,536
Issa take his insulin post-gender world at transhumanist posthuman world

2790
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:51,072
Sexual

2791
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:57,984
That's right they're going to take us to the next level.

2792
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,520
Gender differentiation

2793
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:11,808
She's a crisis actor it's going to be interesting to see if something on your list is when a Tracker to see where she shows up but I'm still

2794
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:12,576
A job

2795

Waiting for her son's light

2796
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:17,184
Do you want to stock this crisis actor

2797
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,464
Is he actually

2798
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:21,024
Interesting if one of your listeners fuc

2800
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,352
Well I mean we don't need to stalk her cuz she's

2801
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:26,144
Is a public person

2802
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,704
CDI got hired by con Saga

2803
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:30,496

I don't care anyway that's what happened to her she's not a crisis actors

2806
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,432
Just someone who

2807

I was dumped In the Heat of the Moment

2808
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:41,504

2809
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,808
Viral

2810
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:45,856
That's about it it's not a crisis actor

2811
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:48,416
Do you know about the crisis publicly shame

2812
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:50,464
Right

2813
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:52,512
Do you know about the people who believe that stuff

2814
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,560
So they believe that

2815
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,584
Sandy Hook deniers

2816
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:57,376
It's everything

2817
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:58,912
Call Levine

2818
02:13:59,168 --> 02:13:59,680
Basta

2819
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:00,704
Embalming

2820
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,472
Everything

2821
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:03,520
You see on the news

2822
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:08,128
We were talking about it everyone who pretends they have a child that died at Sandy Hook

2823
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:09,408
They're all crisis Act

2824
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,992
Better run out of this giant organization by the government

2825
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:14,528
The Pilates false-flag

2826
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,808
And what they do

2827
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:16,576
Their appearance

2828
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:18,112
A bunch and you can tell

2829
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:20,672
Slightly different appearing people

2830
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,976
Always show up at all these places

2831
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:27,584
And so if you go online you can find videos

2832
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,352
Where they're like

2833
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,120
Alright

2834
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:31,680
I see this the principal it's

2835
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:33,216
Happens to look

2836
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:34,240
Just like this

2837
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,008
Sister

2838
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:36,800
I'm someone who died in the Boston bombing

2839
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:38,592
I can tell you that the same people

2840
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:40,640
Because what we've done is

2841
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:42,944
Let's it's it's a wild world

2842
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,224
Wow you go even

2843
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,784
Further into it there's a lot of people who believe

2844
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:49,088
Let these people are actually

2845
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,368
Celebrities

2846
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:52,672
That they change their appearance

2847
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:56,000
To play these roles in the pipe

2848
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:59,072
Even better at acting than we ever thought

2849
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:05,472
Johnny Knoxville is like a bunch of different people who

2850
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,520
Knoxville

2851
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:11,872
Johnny Knoxville is one of the ones that I specifically remember cuz they are like

2852
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:15,200
Why would you

2853
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:17,760
It's fine

2854
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:20,320
It just it's just it's it's

2855
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:22,368
Is prohibitive

2856
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:25,440
Spira Seafair is there anything like that they're just reality

2857
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:28,512

2858
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,280

2859
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,304
Be called reality

2860
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:34,400
Climate crisis actors

2861
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,168
It also

2862
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:35,936
Legit

2863
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:37,984
Like the idea

2864
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:39,008
Dementia

2865
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:43,104
Difficulty that it would take the.

2866
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,640
Like how did they get there

2867
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:45,664
How long did it take

2868
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:51,296
Inconsistent is my

2869
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:54,112
Eva's next clip Alex Jones

2870
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:55,904
Maybe one

2871
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:56,928
Episode

2872
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,744
Alex

2873
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:00,768
About the

2874
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,048
Similarities

2875
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:03,328
Between

2876
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:05,120
What's going on on our campus

2877
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,400
Andy

2878
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:08,960
Nope the Chinese of people's Revolution

2879
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:13,824
Moto goes off on a weird

2880
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:16,640
Edit the lights

2881
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:22,528
It's so bowl that they would

2882
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:30,720
I accept your fighting

2883
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:39,680
Professors my colleagues even if UC Davis are meaning to man up

2884
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:42,496
Sorry for using the sexiest language

2885
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:49,152
Trouble for talking to a pro

2886
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:57,600
These rats are spying on me right now

2887
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:07,328
This point you said is being watched

2888
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,096
As we speak

2889
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:13,472
This should just be the first indication that Daryl Hannah Moto isn't he

2890
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:14,752
Credibly paranoid man

2891
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,800
Listen to this

2892
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,592
The thing about it though it's

2893
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:21,920
Jose about that paranoid like

2894
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:24,992
He's rat spying on me all the time

2895
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,784
No that's called that's called a flat

2896
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:30,624
He doesn't have Peaks

2897
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,904
Valleys in the

2898
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:32,672
Expresses thing

2899
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:35,488
I'm not sure

2900
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:36,256
Credibility

2901
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:39,328
It's a Stein of

2902
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:43,936
Basically I don't mean to sound like I know a lot about psychology

2903
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:46,240
But it is a it is indicative of a disc

2904
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:48,032
With the world around you

2905
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:54,432
Sandy Hook denial crisis actors

2906
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,712
Someone spying on me

2907
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:56,480
Now hear this

2908
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:05,696
Who by the way is deducting 25% of my salary for the next 5 months good and I call here now for her

2909
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:09,280
Immediate resignation as Chancellor of University California

2910
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:14,912
Spoiler alert pretty shortly not for any of the things that he lied

2911
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:17,728
Appropriated camper

2912
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:20,288
Hired her daughter and son-in-law

2913
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:24,128
Or son-in-law and daughter I can't remember exactly

2914
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:25,920
Salary

2915
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:28,736
Classic

2916
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:29,504
Knock-down

2917
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,272
Nephew politics

2918
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,040
Britain

2919
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:35,904
Coronavirus complaints

2920
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,232
That's enough.

2921
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:41,024
What she's doing is

2922
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:47,424
Blatant corruption we can't have that if we want to use the dark metaphor

2923
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:52,800
He hits the house next door doesn't even hit the board

2924
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:53,824
Nextdoor

2925
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:57,920
Is an action

2926
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:59,200
Federal counter

2927
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:10,464
And while you're at it please take

2928
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:14,304
The president of the systems

2929
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:24,544
Emeritus professor

2930
02:19:25,824 --> 02:19:28,128
The commissar

2931
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:31,712
Leave us alone

2932
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:35,296
We're going to rebuild the University of California without you

2933
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:36,576
So

2934
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:38,368
Would listen to

2935
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:39,136
To that clip

2936
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:39,904
Same thing

2937
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:46,304
They are probably trying to find something he's doing that we can fire him for it cuz we accidentally

2938
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:48,864
That is probably what's going on

2939
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:52,704
Now he protect on me

2940
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:56,800
One of his classes

2941
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:58,080
Hilarious

2942
02:19:58,336 --> 02:19:58,848
If he was

2943
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,896
Spot-on as a professor

2944
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,944
But just a lunatic in it downtown

2945
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:07,808
I've read some smokes a ton of crack

2946
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:09,344
Still does a great job

2947
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,648
MMA go home and they're just cracked out

2948
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:14,976
Ratemyprofessors

2949
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:17,280
You can go on there and read some reviews of his glasses

2950
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:20,352
3.5 out of 5

2951
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:26,752
Yeah but the negative ones are like he will just scream at you if you disagree it stuff like that

2952
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,408
But

2953
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,712
He's not going to take that laying down

2954
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,016
He's got a message for the snitches

2955
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:40,576
But he wants to get out on Alex Jones Show

2956
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:41,600
In this next clip

2957
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:45,184
I talked about

2958
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:50,560
Well in all modesty I was teaching introductory classes of 200 students

2959
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:54,400
And my classes were routinely oversubscribed

2960
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:05,664
Departmental Sheriff Department hired somebody specifically

2961
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:07,968
Snitches assistance

2962
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:10,272
To empty out my classes

2963
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:14,624
And she went on social media Twitter Facebook in order to do so

2964
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:23,840
Screwing with people whether it's me or someone else

2965
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:29,216
Eventually they're going to roll over on you for you

2966
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:31,776
Enchantments

2967
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,800
Sabi so-called

2968
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:33,824
Space spaces

2969
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:38,432
Or before you turn your soul over to so-called the student Community Center

2970
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,200
Soca

2971
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:44,064
Right it's the way that Alex does the so-called minority stuff like that

2972
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:46,880
He's just trying to invalidate people who has a

2973
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,928
Community Center

2974
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,952
So-called

2975
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:51,488
Soca

2976
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:53,792
I told you what happened to Linda

2977
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:56,608
She ended up getting fired for misappropriation

2978
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,632
The funds

2979
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:59,680
Hear it

2980
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:05,056
Be fired for

2981
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:06,592
It's Looney

2982
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,640
And you can also tell by

2983
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:15,040
Identification for example the chancellor at

2984
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:19,648
And by the way she holds 19 patents for antennas antennas

2985
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:22,720
Archie

2986
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:24,512
Are the mind control system

2987
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:25,280
So

2988
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:26,304
He believes

2989
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:28,096
He believes

2990
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:30,400
That there are EMF

2991
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:31,168
Yeah

2992
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:32,192
Yeah

2993
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,240
But huh

2994
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:36,544
19 antennas

2995
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:42,944
But but but the reason the reason for that the reason for that is because

2996
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,736
He believes on campus

2997
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:48,320
There is a dual prong attack on Steam

2998
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:51,392
The first Brock is getting a ball on psychiatric drugs

2999
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:53,952
The second is EMF fields

3000
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,512
That are manipulating people and turning them into zombies

3001
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:57,536
So

3002
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:01,376
Alright Linda is only in the position that she's in

3003
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:04,704
As the chancellor of the school

3004
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:06,240
Because she has 19

3005
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,520
Also by the way

3006
02:23:09,056 --> 02:23:10,592
I went and looked into these pads

3007
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:16,480
They're not

3008
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:19,040
Did the full thing of irie's through all of them

3009
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:24,416
This Is My Mind Control patent

3010
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:28,000
But most of them are for antennas

3011
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:29,024
To conserve dual /

3012
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:31,584
So you can get GPS

3013
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:32,864
And radio

3014
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:35,168
As opposed to having to antenna for

3015
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:37,984
They go into great detail about how you

3016
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:38,752
Need two boards

3017
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:40,032
Then there to ground

3018
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:43,104
One signal in the other signal it's all very boring

3019
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,384
But that's the sort of stuff.

3020
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,664
But she was actually invented

3021
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:46,944
She was watching me

3022
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:51,040
You can get a patent at Pendleton so creating some

3023
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:52,320
Give me a song for

3024
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:56,416
Covid-19 all of them might not actually be real

3025
02:23:56,672 --> 02:23:58,208
Come up with them and filed the patent

3026
02:23:58,464 --> 02:23:59,744
Go to to be a placeholder for

3027
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:01,024
She does create them

3028
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,352
Time somebody makes

3029
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:08,960
Same thing she can be like based on her ethical status of

3030
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:12,288
Are you giving her a kid's job situation

3031
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:14,848
Has no intention

3032
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,176
It's not bring

3033
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,712
Imoto

3034
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:20,480
Is crazy

3035
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,296
So unless she's

3036
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,320
Controlling is

3037
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:25,856
To make him go

3038
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:27,136
Well that's interesting

3039
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:29,184
That would discredit all of his theories

3040
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:32,512
Maybe she just hate Asians

3041
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:39,424
Yep there you go so it wanders

3042
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:41,728
We can wander all day about that but

3043
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:47,360
No I got to shut it down now

3044
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:48,896
We've gotten into like

3045
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:50,432
What makes hamamoto

3046
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:56,576
We would still make the argument that he's crazy

3047
02:24:56,832 --> 02:24:58,112
But maybe he's a good teacher

3048
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:00,416
In his next clip describe

3049
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:05,280
A really negative approach towards being a t

3050
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:08,608
Let's see if you feel the same way

3051
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:13,216
She is has declared herself is part of the

3052
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:16,544
Gender and sexuality

3053
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:22,944
Academic expertise in the area

3054
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:26,272
Department and Ray and programs

3055
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:30,112
That the so-called student activists are being recruited from

3056
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:38,816
It's in the bag and you showed a video earlier

3057
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:43,424
Start questioning you

3058
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:52,128
Mind control which they are

3059
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:55,200
And I'll start spontaneously asking you these questions

3060
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:59,040
How to do is break

3061
02:25:59,296 --> 02:26:00,064
And

3062
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:02,112
Crumble

3063
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:07,232
To the stage the final stage

3064
02:26:07,488 --> 02:26:11,584
Here's an open microphone tell me what what you want to see in this class

3065
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:13,888
They have nothing

3066
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:20,288
By the way this is a technique that a lot of comedians

3067
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:23,360
And anything

3068
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:25,920
So if you are doing that

3069
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:29,248
Also

3070
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:32,320
Of course.

3071
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:33,600
Seems like you have

3072
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:34,624
Mentality

3073
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,160
But you're fighting your students

3074
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:37,952
And to me

3075
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:39,744
That's not productive education

3076
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,304
Just don't even like it when they

3077
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:44,864
How do you how do you not

3078
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:48,448
Spontaneously as there's no other way to ask a question

3079
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:52,800
You can't like, Moto I want you into going to ask you a question

3080
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:55,360
Spontaneous

3081
02:26:58,688 --> 02:26:59,712
Part of learning

3082
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:02,784
It's almost like

3083
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:06,368
The responsibilities of a professor is having dialogue with student

3084
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:07,648
Hey whenever someone asks

3085
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:08,928
Question it's an

3086
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:10,208
Learn

3087
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,488
My dude

3088
02:27:11,744 --> 02:27:13,280
Come on hamamoto

3089
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:14,048
Just using

3090
02:27:21,472 --> 02:27:21,984
God

3091
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,776
Glb

3092
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:25,056
F*** you

3093
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,104
Let's touch those.

3094
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,640
Bulshit that he does

3095
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,784
Dude we got it we got to get through this

3096
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:36,832
We're fast approaching

3097
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:43,488
The Moto to get through and then we'll be we'll be out

3098
02:27:44,512 --> 02:27:46,560
Will be home free

3099
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:50,144
Next time we get into some of the reason

3100
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:51,680
Why you believe

3101
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:52,448
Antennas

3102
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:53,984
Our mind control device

3103
02:27:57,056 --> 02:28:02,432
Yeah Welcome to The Monkey House

3104
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:03,712
Giada

3105
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:06,528
Really early on and discoveries Earth

3106
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:16,768
But you have

3107
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:19,072
Seen in people of

3108
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,096
And in person

3109
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,936
This is HAARP in action

3110
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:26,752
So he's talking about a guy named Nick begich

3111
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:31,872
There was actually a member of Congress

3112
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:32,896
In some form

3113
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:34,176
And he died in a plane crash

3114
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:38,016
Nick begich jr. came to prominence by claiming that

3115
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:39,296
His dad was taken out

3116
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:41,344
The government taking him out

3117
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:44,672
So Nick begich Jr is a guy who wrote a famous book

3118
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:45,952
Famous in quotes

3119
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:48,000
Call Angel

3120
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:49,792
It's about HARP

3121
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:56,192
Yeah I'm not going to lie I don't I don't disagree

3122
02:28:57,728 --> 02:29:03,104
So his website he has his dirt

3123
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,128
Is Alex home

3124
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:08,992
Angels Don't Play this heart that's like that's like these colors don't run whatever

3125
02:29:09,248 --> 02:29:11,552
So you have a website called Earth puls.com

3126
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:14,624
If you go to it you have a listing of his resume

3127
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:20,256
Nick begich receive doctor of Medicine medisina alternativa

3128
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:21,024

Thighs honor honor 8 honor

3131
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:30,496
Autorific degree in political science from the open International University for

02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:31,520
Complementary medicine

3133

Sri Lanka

3136
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:37,664
He got a fake degree

3137
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:38,688
From a

3138
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:39,968
Sri Lanka in

3139
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:42,272
Well

3140
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:46,624
Maybe open International University appears to be a diploma Mill

3141
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:48,672
And it has been described as

3142
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:52,512
The grandfather of diploma Mills

3143
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:53,280
The top one

3144
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:56,864
Slmd degrees particularly dangerous

3145
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:59,168
Lorde

And claimed to be affiliated with the open International University

3151
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:14,784
Presumably

3152
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,064
Name that way to be

3153
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,368
Confused with the open University of Sri Lanka

3154
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:21,696
Course you sold diplomas for various feet

3155
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:24,256
I have a copy of his charge list for 19

02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:41,664
And regular degrees for 100 100 $45

3161
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:43,968
So much

3162
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:44,992
Cheaper

3163
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:46,784
What I

3164
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,808
Went to college

3165
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:48,832
Totally

3166
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:50,624
Worth almost as much

3167
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:52,160
Jeffrey dumet

3168
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:54,720
An Australian neuropath who bought his doctorate

3169
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:56,256
Diploma Mill

3170
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:59,584
Was charged with manslaughter in the death of a 37-year old kitten

10 days

3175
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:06,240
And hasten the page

3176
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:10,592
Whichever you want to talk about the liver cleanse

3177
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:11,360
Stuff like that

3178
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:12,896
Kidney cleanse

3179
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:14,944
Gallbladder cleanse that Alex sells

3180
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,528
Through doctor group who also has a fake

3181
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:21,600
The thing that they talk about it working

3182
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:23,392
Is often related to weight loss

3183
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:27,488
Which could be very simple if someone was using them

3184
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,792
It probably could kill them much like

3185
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:32,096
This case here if its Australian

3186
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:33,888
Australian

3187
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:37,216
Nick begich started to do a bunch of bulshit

3188
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:39,008
About about HARP

3189
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,032
You got into harp

3190
02:31:41,824 --> 02:31:43,616
If you want to look into it it's

3191
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:44,640
It's pretty interesting

3192
02:31:45,152 --> 02:31:48,224
Because everyone talks about Harper being this massive weapons

3193
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:49,248
The can be used

3194
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:51,296
The chute

3195
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:53,600
It's basically the MacGuffin

3196
02:31:54,112 --> 02:31:56,672
In terms of anytime you need an explanation for something

3197
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:57,952
How do you control hurricane

3198
02:31:58,208 --> 02:32:02,304
It's harp and DARPA are the two that everyone always ask that

3199
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:03,328
Who cares

3200
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:04,352
That don't worry about it

3201
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:08,448
Brakes been done of the amount of energy that comes out of

3202
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:09,216
Ruthie's harp

3203
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:11,520
And it's so absurd

3204
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:12,544
Bigoted

3205
02:32:14,336 --> 02:32:15,104
Everyone takes it

3206
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:16,896
But massively powerful

3207
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:19,968
But if you break it down and compare it to the amount of radiation

3208
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:20,736
And it just comes from

3209
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:22,016
From the Sun naturally

3210
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:22,784
It's not even

3211
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:24,320
Incomparable

3212
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:25,344
Stupid it's just

3213
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,368
Really stupid

3214
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,160
The harp stuff is dumb

3215
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:30,208
Hamamoto is f****** dumb

3216
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:30,976
For calling

3217
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:33,024
Nick begich doctor Vegas

3218
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:35,840
Really think means he's never looked into this

3219
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:37,120
Except

3220
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:39,424
Whatever did Wild dude

3221
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:41,984
Again had a great name for a book

3222
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,264
A about got to give him that

3223
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,056
View the doctor book

3224
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:48,384
Humberto is

3225
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,432
That's better than a lot of

3226
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:53,248
Sure I'll tell you that right now

3227
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:58,112
Ephesus twice-annual chorus

3228
02:32:58,368 --> 02:33:01,184
Remove the book

3229
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:03,488
Exactly

3230
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,352
Alex Jones

3231
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:20,896
Wonderful

3232
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:27,552
It is an adventure I am so glad happy honored to be here in 2015

3233
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:33,952
Joining in this battle with you and the team and American around the world

3234
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:50,592
The programming just disappears it's not that strong

3235
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:56,224
I don't have an axe to grind or hidden agenda

3236
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:57,504
Your agendas very public

3237
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:58,528
Wild

3238
02:33:58,784 --> 02:33:59,296
A badge

3239
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:01,088
So do you know about getting true

3240
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:02,368
Gang stalking

3241
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,672
I have no idea what gang stalking

3242
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:10,560
So it's the police that a lot of really paranoid people have that large groups of people are stalking them

3243
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:12,864
So it would be like if you keeps

3244
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:13,632
Being certain

3245
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:15,168
People in your day-to-day life

3246
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:20,544
It's the you create the belief within your head and all of them are working together to drive

3247
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:22,336
And it's

3248
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:24,384
A very very clear sign

3249
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:27,456
Of almost destroyed

3250
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:28,992
There

3251
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:32,064
I don't know if it's ever been done

3252
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,088
Quite frankly

3253
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:35,392
Maybe it has it some point someone has done that

3254
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:37,440
But it is

3255
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:39,232
Definitely

3256
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:40,000
Hallmark

3257
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:42,560
Cuz it's just random people

3258
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,168
Psychological

3259
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:51,520
I think you would fight that pretty hard

3260
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:53,312
I think it probably like trying

3261
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:57,920
I don't know you might be right that's too hypothetical who cares they're railroading

3262
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:00,992
Who knows

3263
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:02,528
Paranoid schizophrenia

3264
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:06,368
Defending against

3265
02:35:08,928 --> 02:35:10,464
Stocks or whatever

3266
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,744
Spied on in his classes

3267
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:14,816
Is Crisis actors

3268
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:21,216
He didn't do it he wants to warn the snitches we believe that Linda has a bun

3269
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:22,752
Bunch of patents for antennas

3270
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:27,616
In order to get harp energy as explained to him by a fake.

3271
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:30,688
They will create brain-controlled zombies on campus

3272
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:33,248
In order to advocate for Liberal causes

3273
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:34,784
He is wild

3274
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:38,112
He the comic book he is my favorite crazy

3275
02:35:43,488 --> 02:35:44,512
At the end of that clip

3276
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:46,816
He gets into like these gangstalkers

3277
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:50,400
All you have to do is say no shoot through their programming

3278
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:52,960
You know what that is

3279
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:56,032
No

3280
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:57,312
Expressing their is like

3281
02:35:57,568 --> 02:35:59,872
You getting their face you puncture their

3282
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:01,408
There their programming

3283
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:03,712
And then they you know they just go away

3284
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:04,992
The reality is

3285
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,784
You probably say a bunch of crazies

3286
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:08,832
Stop somebody like I'm out

3287
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:09,856
About

3288
02:36:10,112 --> 02:36:12,672
I don't talk to you anymore

3289
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:14,720
So we have one more clip

3290
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:17,280
On this day

3291
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:19,840
November 12th there's a visit from

3292
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,376
And we have nothing from

3293
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:23,168
Cuz they resolved very boring

3294
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:26,496
Interview Larry Nichols just tries to get money to his Paypal

3295
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:29,824
And Alex Jones

3296
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:32,384
Shoutouts to people who

3297
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:39,808
Mac keeps trying to do and now it's like we can't

3298
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,344
Can't do that you'd

3299
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:45,696
Just can't name everybody who send you money

3300
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:54,144
Call when something like a group come on now

3301
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:57,728
Special group there's a difference between what we do and what they do

3302
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,288
The only thing that

3303
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:01,568
Interesting that you reveal

3304
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:02,336
Is Vicki

3305
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,104
Dinos

3306
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:06,944
That Ross Perot was an intelligence officer running a game

3307
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:13,088
Ross Perot

3308
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:19,488
Made a deal with the Clinton

3309
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:22,048
In order to run for president

3310
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:22,816
Screw things up

3311
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:26,400
For George h.w. Bush

3312
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:28,192
Did not split that he didn't

3313
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:29,472
Take both away from either

3314
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:30,752
Candidate

3315
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:31,520
Provoked

3316
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:34,080
Right but he

3317
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,248
The fucken on the show so we don't need to listen to him

3318
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:42,016
But

3319
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,552
Alex dropped this

3320
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:45,856
Real fun

3321
02:37:46,112 --> 02:37:46,880
This is this is

3322
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:48,672
This is Alex Jones being

3323
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:50,208
What I've described as

3324
02:37:50,464 --> 02:37:51,744
Strfkr

3325
02:37:52,768 --> 02:37:53,792
Strfkr

3326
02:37:55,584 --> 02:38:00,192
By the way

3327
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:01,728
It's always bad

3328
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:08,128
People don't want to come

3329
02:38:10,688 --> 02:38:11,712
Former

3330
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:16,576
I don't want to be talked about

3331
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:22,208
How many people are aware of what's going on

3332
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:24,000
And last night

3333
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,048
I got a phone call

3334
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,584
Bye

3335
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,656
Got to say is one of the coolest Hollywood

3336
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:34,752
Answer the phone

3337
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:40,384
40 attacks

3338
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:43,712
I'll just say that

3339
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:52,928
I just cannot beat how many grapes

3340
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:54,464
So wait

3341
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:55,232
So

3342
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:57,024
Do you know who he's talking about

3343
02:38:58,048 --> 02:39:00,096
It's from The Big Lebowski

3344
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:00,864
Is it

3345
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:07,264
Who has the vaguely of German.

3346
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:10,080
It's Peter Stormare

3347
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:13,920
Oh so it's not

3348
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:15,200
Now I can't remember her

3349
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:21,600
Call Aimee Mann

3350
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:23,136
I don't think any man has any

3351
02:39:23,392 --> 02:39:27,488
Lions in the movie She's just there at the diner with them

3352
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:32,608
Right there is the one who says give us the money Lebowski

3353
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,680
He is like his cohort is a associate

3354
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:40,288
I am fascinated

3355
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:41,824
Peter Stormare is like

3356
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,640
A giant star

3357
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:48,480
A bunch of stuff like he's a character actor he's in a lot of like

3358
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:52,576
The Coen Brothers Salvatore

3359
02:39:52,832 --> 02:39:56,928
He's great in American Gods that died

3360
02:39:57,184 --> 02:40:03,072
The Big Lebowski

3361
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:05,888
Yeah there's a long list of people you'd rather

3362
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:08,192
Turn out to be classical liberal

3363
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:10,240
Maybe John Turturro

3364
02:40:10,496 --> 02:40:16,640
Or notes or Philip Seymour

3365
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:23,040
Philip Seymour Hoffman

3366
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:24,832
Colibri

3367
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:27,392
Probably not probably not Tara Reid

3368
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:37,888
Peter Stormare but I got great

3369
02:40:38,144 --> 02:40:41,472
But now it turns out that

3370
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:46,080
I'm kind of on the fence again Alex

3371
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:54,016
Miss attributing a line

3372
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:56,576
Like he might think John Turturro says that

3373
02:40:59,648 --> 02:41:01,696
You might not know that it don't f*** with the Jesus's

3374
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:07,072
Peter Stormare

3375
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:10,144
Invert Warrior theoretically

3376
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:11,680
Transformers movies

3377
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:14,240
Where was that me

3378
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:15,520
So was Wahlberg

3379
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:17,568
Wahlburgers

3380
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:18,336
Come on

3381
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:22,688
Isn't John Cena in the new Transformer

3382
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:29,088
I don't know I think he is I don't know about John Cena

3383
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:32,160
You don't have any Troll Music like that kind of the hornet

3384
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:36,000
So will you come to the end of our adventure here

3385
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:39,072
No evolution in terms of trump

3386
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:44,704
Some mentioned Russian Putin now but what we have is

3387
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:45,728
String

3388
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:46,752
F****** lunatic

3389
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,544

3390
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:50,080
Are coming aboard

3391
02:41:51,616 --> 02:41:53,408
But these are people who have been on the show

3392
02:41:53,664 --> 02:41:54,176
Before

3393
02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:56,992
For the most part like Mancow and Alex are good friends

3394
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:00,064
Hamamoto has been around

3395
02:42:00,576 --> 02:42:05,184

3398
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:11,840

02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:12,864
The lady who sells

3400
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:15,936
Laminated cards for thirty bucks

3401
02:42:16,448 --> 02:42:21,824
That's it but you're seeing like the show is getting crazy

3402
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:24,384
There is

3403
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,152
She shows up

3404
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:28,736
If there's an escalation of crazy that's going on and it's

3405
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:29,760
Super interesting

3406
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:34,112
