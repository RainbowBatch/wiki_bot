1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168

00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,568

00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,128
Alex Jones

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Loudly

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
I mean it

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
Not that far back

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Certainly it's

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
Very common occurrence

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,696
I don't remember the last time but I know that

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
For me Morris

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,072
Before I normally do

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Because somebody was talking

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
So loudly

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
On the train

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
The conversation isn't even worth reporting back

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,616
No it was horrific your report it was horrific

17
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,944
Boring conversation overheard on train

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
Brutal

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
Cool

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
It was just so angry that I just died

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
Is it was

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536
Could do was trapped in this

23
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
Half of the converse

24
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Lewis are you excited

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288

Come on

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
I don't know if he has the money

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
Irrelevant

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,168
Irrelevant

33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544

00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960

And I apologize

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Need to come to the show

00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,528
So we're like found him on Twitter

43
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
Things didn't work out no put in doing so we did find that Murphy has a pretty good sense of humor

44
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:43,584
Okay keeps calling people female humans real humans

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,192
The other thing tweeted they'll never forget was

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Don't nobody love these hoes

47
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776

That's Irish name

59
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,008
I have looked how it's pronounced and I have since forgotten if I feel terrible

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568

61
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
But either way we appreciate it oh so very much thank you for your support

62
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456

We can do it by going to knowledge fight.com

64
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Couldn't support the show button

65
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Appreciated

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,208
I wanted to do a present-day episode

67
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Because we've been

68
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Sort of

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
You know we were in the past on Monday

70
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
Yeah I thought it'd be good to check in on the present but then I saw an article where Alex was saying that the

71
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
The shooting at that synagogue

72
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
You can stop right there and I said

73
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
Yeah no no

74
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
I know that

75
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
Like looking at the the the abyss

76
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Is kind of part of

77
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,695
What does show does a lot of Stephen like

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,023
Like water why are we doing this

79
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,351
You get drawn into it

80
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
I just don't think there's much

81
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Like

82
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
Talking about that

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
I think that's

84
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Like

85
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Alright get back

86
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
And assholes

87
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Two-story out there's nothing to look at

88
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,023
Irrelevant

89
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,863
It's weird that way

90
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,935
Somewhat it so I decided it was staying in the past

91
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
And today we're going over in episode

92
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
From March

93
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
20th 2009

94
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Tell me what episode

95
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,895
Because I also am going to just stay off

96
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Off the top

97
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Is the Friday episode

98
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,527
March 22nd 2009

99
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Sunday

100
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Annette

101
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Was hot garbage

102
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
I realize that Alex Jones

103
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
Nowadays

104
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
A soft launch is for his married

105
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,351
To test something out see how it feels coming out of his little bit of an open

106
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
He'll do it on Sunday

107
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Back in 2009

108
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,311
He would just do a recap of all the bulshit he talked about lots and I realized

109
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,359
It's because back then

110
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,735
More people listen to Sunday shows because it was distributed by emmis Communications

111
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
Audience on Sunday

112
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
So we tried to make the most of it

113
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Right now

114
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
If you knows the less people look like on Sunday

115
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
So who gives a s*** that's f*****

116
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
So I realized

117
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
This is technically March 20th and 22nd

118
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
Compare apps

119
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Having our context drop

120
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
I am an animal I am vicious

121
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Ivory

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,783
Today's episode of our last

123
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
2009

124
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
We had

125
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
I think probably the most Subs

126
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,231
Something that happened was Alex got a visit from the guy who started the Oath Keepers

127
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
To wish on anyone

128
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
Like if you told me that

129
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
Visit from the guy who started the Oath Keepers RV like how do I run away from this

130
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
Alex's

131
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Quarterflash song

132
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Harden My Heart

133
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
Keepers

134
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
And that will serve as a transition

135
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
That mystery is a little

136
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
We've got a lead

137
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Yeah in that one

138
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:35,679
Further where we last left off he was going real hard on the miac report bulshit

139
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Really trying to

140
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Sane

141
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
Create the idea that the government

142
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,127
Hates Patriots and they're taking on over

143
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
We all do now

144
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
Here we go this is where Alex starts the show and it's sort of indicative of his mood throughout that I would say at least

145
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
The first half hour 45 min

146
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,287
Just how serious the situation were in

147
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,687
You know I don't

148
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,183
And I'm telling you that they're going to kill the majority of us

149
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,351
You are doing a

150
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
Aw said something that made me laugh

151
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
The problem with it is that he is right

152
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,151
He's always proved

153
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
Has demonstrated over all of our episodes

154
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
Put together

155
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
Pretty solid

156
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
Truth-telling

157
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
Lingering

158
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,839
Views of Gandhi is that quote that like first they ridicule you then they

159
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,471
Bella is really dumb ideas

160
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,847
Take solace in the fact that they're being ridiculous because they think they're on the path to being revolutionary

161
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Yeah

162
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Exactly

163
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Like where Alex

164
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:27,551
Just a note to anybody speaking of a sagging inspirational quote

165
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
It can be used against

166
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
So don't

167
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
Be careful be careful with your inspiration

168
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
I want the very least once again

169
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
This is a

170
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Sick situation to add the... Except

171
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
This is a great one

172
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
Birthday laughing

173
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
F*** you

174
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
What kind of

175
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
Rolling around like a

176
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,199
Picking s*** about how people make fun of him but he's always right

177
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
Isn't tire headspace and I'm not sure exactly why that is

178
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
I don't see any external reason for him to be like

179
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
Is there anything like that

180
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Consuming his person

181
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
You talk about it

182
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
A bunch

183
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,983
Lindback does hours and hours every day already on TV on it

184
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
He's on with my ex

185
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
It was out for a few days and get the attention we pointed out the Iowa National Guard

186
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,279
Dealers

187
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
How lockdown the time

188
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Was what that story was

189
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,543
Criticize

190
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,151
Army troops

191
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,479
Associated Press

192
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
See this is where the difficulty with Alex back then was

193
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
He is right about

194
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:12,767
Episode

195
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
It wasn't some nefarious let's put troops on the street

196
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Weezer

197
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,271
Responsibility

198
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,927
He brings in the Arcadia

199
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Simulating the idea of

200
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Looking for someone in

201
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
In a town it wasn't gun

202
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
Confiscation drill

203
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Like that

204
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
To do with it but then he is right about the

205
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Exaggerate

206
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
So it's like okay

207
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
You get half a boy

208
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,199
You know what he's absolutely right we really shouldn't have the military operating within our borders

209
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
Interesting

210
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
That is a principal

211
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Stick to it

212
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,255
He doesn't change based on the weather and whether or not the guy

213
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Is doing it

214
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095

00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
I'm here to get the barbed wire first

217
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
After

218
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
You know what I like

219
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
Because I'm doing this for

220
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,423
Ecology

221
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
Oh boy

222
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,455
Something

223
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,063
The alien lady

Martial law New York

225
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
I mean

226
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,463
Dangerous level of

227
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Flagellation

228
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,399
I guess someone was on the last

229
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
And they spoke like that

230
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
You

231
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
AR

232
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
A little out there

233
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
You you are unhealthy

234
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,407
I agree with what you stand for but you are unhealthy and I don't think you're the right person

235
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,271
That's kind of how I would look at it just from like a human standpoint

236
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Hey

237
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,487
I know that he seems to be the example I pull up all the time but

238
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,839
Because I think he's funny and I like him but like I was acting like that

239
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Never again

240
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
I'm beside you an e-mail see if you're okay

241
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,799
Lego who's this who's the dude

242
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591

244
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,575
I felt pretty similar

245
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
F****** calm it down

246
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,255
We might agree with.

247
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,167
It's unhealthy when you perceive yourself This way everything is going to be in

248
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,055
Nothing is ever going to be you're never going to be able to look at the world realistic

249
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Because you're not looking

250
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Yourself real

251
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
And so Alex

252
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Deep in that mindset

254
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Hello

255
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,767
Not you have to talk more about how he's always right about

256
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,423
Literally

257
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247

We started the 9/11 truth movement

260
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Yeah you do

261
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,215

The power you have

264
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,319
So the first thing I want to talk about about that

265
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
Examples in order to establish his credibility

Complete post-modern militia

268
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,471
There was a real document that WikiLeaks

269
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
But he completely lied about the cont

270
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,199
He made it Elementary logical fallacy about what the inference was of the report

271
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,527
At 9:11 still out on whether or not

272
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,087

The entire

Quickly

279
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,383
How long did it take for the 9/11 truth movie

280
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Start after

281
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Towers in Howell

282
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Like this is the governor

00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Michaela

284
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Ernie brought it

285
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
Tower bowling alley was like government did it let's move on whatever time he was on air

286
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
That's good

287
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
That's the best time spookables your world is watching the worst terror attack in America

288
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Alright alright

289
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
911 prices

290
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,303
9 oz / 11

291
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,143
I mean what what better time to override people's sense of like

292
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
I got to check this out first

293
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
This clip is Alex

294
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
The word shock

295
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Rocket troops

296
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
To Define his audience

297
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
I know Alex loves

298
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,575
Use military terminology to describe players in his information

299
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
Doctor Strange

300
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:10,047
The term shock troops isn't Americanization of the German word

301
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Which is the name

302
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
Specifically established to be Hitler's bodyguard

303
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
The concept of shock troops had existed prior to

304
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
Hitler

305
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,431
Describe offensive attack units

306
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Interesting Lee many scholars on combat

307
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,087
Do the strategy that isis uses of employee suicide bombers as a form of modern

308
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,463
One of the reasons why Alex metaphors disturbing

309
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Rarely survive

310
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,143
They would go in and light up the rear guard of the base or something like that

311
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
But I'm pretty much invariably be killed in the process

312
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,055
In the west the concept grew out of units that we referred to as forlorn hope unit

313
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
The name reflecting how Dreadful their position was

314
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,455
The idea was that these troops ago in a whole lot of them would die or be

315
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,575
But if they were lucky they might be able to establish a position that they could then defend

316
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,391
Often the soldiers would be willing to take such huge risk

317
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,231
Because in many cases they work inscribed prisoners or no choice

318
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
Or because they were promised great reward should they survive

319
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Alex Jones

320
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
This sort of a soldier is very

321
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,727
If you just add the caveat that the war they're waging is Imagine

322
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,383
Alex knows full well what he's doing to his audience with his lies and propaganda is mortally wounding them in battle

323
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
They may not end up with a limp or missing limb

324
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,271
Abby end of being

325
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,087
Shock troops in imaginary globalist

326
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
The equivalent of social death

327
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
Banana community

328
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Except for with their fellow info Warriors

329
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,279
Little further insulate them more and leave

330
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
Leave them be more interested in being a doctor

331
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
So there's a there's a metaphor Alex

332
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
Is accidentally making

333
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
It's really it's a real bummer when you realize like

334
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,175
On some subconscious level Alex's expressing an understanding of how much he's

335
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Crippling

336
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
His own list

337
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,831
Brainworm kind of APK

338
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,159
Even he in his like I would say

339
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
Minor understanding of the term still

340
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
They're going in

341
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
They're the ones

342
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
To take the Brunt

343
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
Right

344
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
They they are

345
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,383
Billions of dollars

346
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,455
Kind of like

You're not a shock trooper

Dollars a year

351
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
It's so today

Exist

353
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
You're scared of it

354
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Yes

355
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
I don't understand what was I saying again

Martial law New York

357
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
This sort of

00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Analog

359
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Is language

360
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,608
Especially when it's couched in the

361
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
The psychology that Alex's

362
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
Clearly

363
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
I love it

364
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
Cuz I'm always right eventually

365
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,384
You guys are out there

366
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
That's really really f***** up and it would be f***** up if he actually was right about things

367
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
He's wrong about everything

368
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
I mean the picture starts to take shape

369
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
Destroy people's lives

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024

We're back from the break

374
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
The metaphorical break

00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
Run outside

381
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,544
Police drug dealing and Corruption

382
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,456
Mary considers options martial law

383
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,808
The story that he's going to leave and he's going to leave it into like they're trying to

384
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
Martial law in place in

385
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Schenectady New York

386
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
That is the best

387
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
And unfortunately in Alex

388
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,304
His telling of the introduction to the story there

389
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Solved

390
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
The mystery

391
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Clearly

392
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,960
Because he says that Jason bermas is from around there and they have

393
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Police corruption problem

394
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
That's what this is about

395
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
It's not martial law

396
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
It's about 8

397
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
Deeply deeply entrenched

398
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Incorruption

399
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Police

400
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
So

401
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
The beginning 2000

402
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Town of Schenectady face

403
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Multiple officers

404
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Leaving a mess

405
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
E6 officer

406
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Department

407
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
According to the Daily Gazette

408
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,864
The six officers who may be fired or Darren Lawrence accused of drunk driving

409
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,472
Crashing in the colonies fleeing the scene and beating a friend to keep him from recording the inside

410
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:42,592
Sounds right Michael Brown accused of driving drunk hitting another car fleeing the scene refusing a breathalyzer

411
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Weather test John Lewis

412
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,712
BWI threatened to kill his ex-wife and numerous other charges

413
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Sam's Diner

414
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
And Andrew k0i

415
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
Charis Kiewit

416
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
Accused of beating during an arrest

417
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Dwayne Johnson

418
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,536
Accused of leaving work 4 hours early on numerous Tuesday

419
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
Might just be a Stern warning is just a

420
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,568
Did you Brody

421
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,408
Alright however I do

422
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
To have guns

423
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
Publicly

424
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,112
List of all these people acting with impunity and either beating suspect while in custody

425
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
Going home from work early

426
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
Describe it

427
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
And they beat the s*** out of the sky

428
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Trying to understand

429
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
People f******

430
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Sometimes

431
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Menu

432
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,056
You beat up somebody in order to not get arrested or

433
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
You know you trying to threaten to kill your ex-wife on top of it

434
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
Yeah okay we got a problem

435
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,064
Clifford was undergoing

436
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
80 told the dispatch

437
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
But he was going out on a detail

438
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,976
You still on the clock or just went and got some dental procedures

439
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
I'm fine with

440
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
The Civilian Complaint review board listening to any of their complaints

441
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
I need a Civilian Complaint

442
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,848
He even said he felt that he was just an errand boy like a courier delivering complaints

443
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
That would then be ignored

444
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,016
Yeah that sounds right city councilman Gary McCarthy said quote I'd like to go one week where we don't have a negative newspaper article about the

445
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
Department it's just baffling that they it's just

446
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Keeps happening

447
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
It's human nature that people are going to make mistakes but this seems so into

448
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Institutionalized

449
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,536
Schenectady mayor Brian Stratton was kind of in a tough situation

450
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
He was facing the possibility that

451
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
Fire a group of police officers

452
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,008
Those were just the officers that they had potential grounds for dismissal for that wouldn't likely get challenge

453
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Just cause for termination

454
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
For Better or Worse

455
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,456
Please have a pretty f****** good union

456
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,760
People support unions only when it comes

457
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,576
Who's the police here

458
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
I absolutely I absolutely support the police Avenue Union but you have to recognise in a situation like this

459
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,560
Then you become deeply entrenched

460
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
Inside

461
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Police force

462
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,680
The union does make it incredibly difficult in order to have

463
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
I know what you're called

464
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
Easy solution

465
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Because

466
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
They have a strong

467
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
Protection

468
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Because that protection

469
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Nasacort

470
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Situation like police

471
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
Sing it could very easily be used

472
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Politically

473
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Seriously

474
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
So the protector

475
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Is there a

476
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
Also gives you that

477
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,608
6 dozen the other words

478
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Like you f***** up

479
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
And yourself

480
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Trooper

481
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
This is where they have the tea

482
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Just go to work

483
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,640
And sit in a room all day because

484
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
They can't be allowed in your stew

485
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Like

486
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Ultimately

487
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
Mayor Brian

488
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,112
Stratton had just said the calling

489
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
Department

490
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:12,256
Calling in county or National Guard help with

491
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,912
Not surprisingly to get off the ground but anyway

492
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Comment from the mayor

493
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
And even in response to the comment or like

494
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
Yeah you can do that without the governor

495
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,896
So the mayor doesn't even have the authority to do that it was just

496
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Trying to express

497
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
In some way

498
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
How severe of the Rat

499
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
He was willing to if

500
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Need be

501
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,368
Look into this as a solution where they dissolved

502
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
The entire police

503
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Department because it would be

504
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Impossible

505
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
Yeah that were resulting in

506
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Population

507
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
A little bit

508
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
5

509
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
So now the problem of police corruption

510
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
Corruption's

511
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
Stratton did not give up

512
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
2011

513
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Completed mission

514
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
Enforcing out entrenched office

515
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Who did things like quote

516
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,944
Rachel flowers while fighting in a bar

517
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Board of course there was a case of

518
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
Detective Jeffrey Curtis

519
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Became addicted

520
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
Did the crack cocaine

521
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
From the Police Department evidence

522
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Curtis compromised evidence in more than a dozen cases

523
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
What is that

524
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
We have a situation like that and

525
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
He took a year

526
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
And found novel solution

527
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,656
In order to get around things like the

528
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
Limitations of the

529
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
Do unions he was able to find ways

530
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
To convince a lot of these officers through

531
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
Resign

532
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Eddie made it his mission

533
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
He retired heaven

534
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Completed

535
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
Events to do in office

536
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
Actually

537
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
Obviously don't know everything about Schenectady politics or Brian Stratton

538
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,048
Like it really good success story

539
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
In many ways insurance would like setting out

540
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,936
Will you get it off if you realize oh s*** look at all

541
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Look at this mess

542
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Our our budget

543
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
Is completely stocked up

544
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
Police force is a disaster

545
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
And you said about trying to make changes

546
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,152
Along the way you make

547
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,760
We're willing to call in National Guard in County

548
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
If we have to

549
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
Dissolve the department

550
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,696
And propagandists like Alex jump all over that instead of looking at like oh my God there's a lot of positive

551
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Liver forms

552
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
I need

553
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Do anything

554
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Did the real bad

555
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,168
Bierocracy

556
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
He worked

557
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,776
The real story is Alex

558
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
Paul Joseph Watson

559
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Stratton

560
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Respond

561
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:45,344
Yeah because then that'll be later Alex we'll talk about that one that actually happened

562
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
A couple

563
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
Weeks down the road or whatever but like you don't do that cuz then they just

564
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
Get to dance on your letter

565
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,768
Or whatever by what your letters

566
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Seems like a civil service

567
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
You did a great job

568
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
And help the people of connect

569
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Be quiet

570
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
Alex

571
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Is a complete liar

572
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,456
Why do people

573
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
Heading to be part-time

574
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,440
So I mean here we have Alex starting to show up in the entire thing is about a guy I'm right all the time and people

575
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,744
New York martial law story that the

576
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
Complete lie that you

577
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,376
And that is this is why I

578
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Any chance

579
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
It doesn't help

580
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Is it against that he have

581
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Not be hard

582
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Heating interview

583
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
It seems like

584
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
If you're a politician

585
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
I got a lot of

586
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,920
What time you have to

587
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Hold back

588
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
Diplomatic learn how

589
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
There should be

590
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Uofu exception

591
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
Is that where you're allowed to

592
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Just go be like

593
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
You know like your response to Alex should always just

594
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,280
You should be allowed in all public like nobody is allowed to write

595
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,608
Complaints or whatever

596
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
Alex

597
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
F*** that guy

598
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,752
And we remove the taboo of

599
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,800
Tearing off on it

600
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
Yeah I don't

601
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
I don't disagree with that

602
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,064
We get here now

603
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
Guest

604
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Are very

605
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
Not hard-hitting

606
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Which is another reason why people are like what

607
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
What the f***

608
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Rightly

609
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
He has

610
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,864
The time he has his sponsors on the show

611
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
And they're not

612
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Not announced as

613
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
SAR

614
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
It's just them

615
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
Telling stories and weaving narratives

616
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
A disappearance

617
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Feisty

618
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
Alex Jones

619
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
Direct sponsor

620
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,880
I want to bring up for the balance of the shower before

621
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,744
SeaWorld

622
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,912
4 minutes of news I was covering

623
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
Well I think it's absolutely Anna

624
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
Bored with what you and I were go

625
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Going to talk about

626
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
HR

627
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
75

628
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
425

629
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Were there

630
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
Weather moving on

631
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Do just as you and I have talked about

632
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
The last 3 years

633
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Moving on it like a

634
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,232
We have a situation here where he has his food sponsor on cells

635
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
Survival bunker

636
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,352
It's basically who's coming into talk about this legislation

637
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
I'll bet Alex

638
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,776
If we mentioned it in passing on recent episode

639
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,920
In Tulsa where is is like now they're talking about where's the budget for

640
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,712
Upkeep and things like that

641
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Not about that trying to

642
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,648
We've this narrative into being like they're going to try and encroach on YouTube

643
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
Do you want be able to have a garden in your

644
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
Home

645
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
Story is now

646
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
Now I just don't

647
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
Understand why

648
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
He doesn't say where

649
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
We're going to go to the shack

650
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,288
Little bit more mornings

651
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,848
Might be a little more entertaining

652
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:27,552
There's a fun little bit of Internet hysteria that went around in early 2000's conservative

653
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,416
Conspiracy theorist

654
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,024
It's called HR 875 which is what species

655
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
Just brought up is a house resolution

656
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,912
The sponsor of that bill representative Rosa delauro was more than fair

657
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,448
It was a response to

658
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
According to the Huffington Post quote

659
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,848
The intent of the bill is to focus on the large industrial processes such as the

660
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Peanut process

661
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
Implant in Georgia that was responsive

662
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
Before the salmonella outbreak that killed

663
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
She says

664
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
Fantasizes at the concert

665
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
Students Commerce Clause

666
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
Prevent the federal government from regulating Commerce

667
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
What does across state line

668
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
There's wiggle room on that

669
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
There's like a little update

670
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
At the end of the article

671
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
So I just felt like giving

672
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:18,240
Delauro says that she's open to making technical changes in the Bill of any small farmers remain concerned

673
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,592
The article goes on to say Dolores

674
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
He's been told that the dissing

675
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
Information campaign

676
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Operation somewhere in the country

677
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
But we're trying to

678
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
To figure it out

679
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,832
I think I could help her sort that mystery right out

680
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,624
Libertarian

681
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,024
RadioShack

682
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Hatred of Regulation

683
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
More by

684
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
Moneyed interest

685
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,984
Who have a

686
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,616
Big'o

687
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Alternate build

688
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:01,760
Committee Rosa delauro introduced the year prior

689
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,184
So also sf-425 is the other bill that

690
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Shake Break

691
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,936
Before this episode

692
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
The house version was not backed up

693
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Committee on February 4th

694
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,336
All of this is just lies about what the text

695
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
The bills say

696
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
It didn't even get voted on

697
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
The only reason the covering is a tall is

698
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
Because it's something very easy to craft

699
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
The Narrative of government encroach

700
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
Plus it has the added benefit of being something with

701
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:43,488
Easy to twist into being about big food like Monsanto trying to crush your home so you rely on them for food

702
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,280
When in reality the bill was written

703
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
It was

704
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,864
Specifically designed to regulate big Interstate comfort

705
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
Nothing to do with guard

706
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
Like

707
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,520
Basically it's just a sales page that allows Steve shank and Izzy Foods Direct

708
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,080
To enjoy some of that status

709
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
Did Alex Jones love stove

710
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
And uses to sell his

711
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,528
Be victim so bad while running everything and ruining people's lives

712
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
Fetishize

713
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
Because something we don't ever really take

714
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
2 into consideration

715
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
Super powerful as a motivator

716
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
Like

717
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Fear and empathy

718
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,288
Same time

719
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
Ability to help us

720
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,920
Turtle of the empathy

721
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
The people have for likes

722
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Steve

723
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Or for Alex

724
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,808
They probably have some misplaced

725
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
You know any emotional response

726
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
People can use

727
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,840
To get you to override your better judgement

728
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,168
I stopped short of calling it

729
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,288
Brilliant powerful Market

730
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
It's in effect

731
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,992
What is the beginning of the show

732
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
So everyone

733
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
Dancing all over Jacob Wohl

734
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Yeah I know that's hilarious

735
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
That was the dumbest

736
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Press coverage that was

737
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
Astonishingly.

738
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
The other guy

739
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Yes

740
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
Jack burkman

741
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Headed fly

742
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Yes no

743
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
That's not what I wanted that's not what I wanted to bring up

744
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,128
Although it is fun

745
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
Slido

746
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
If listeners

747
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,600
Longtime listeners do the show might recognize the name Jack burkman

748
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
And the reason for that

749
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
That is we went over

750
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,976
Along

751
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Months ago

752
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
We went over Alex Jones

753
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,168
Trying to tell the story of the Seth Rich investigator who got shot

754
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:05,568
And it turns out that that was just a situation where he had hired another crazy guy to work with him and Amanda

755
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,128
The guy who got shot was Jack burkman

756
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Nice to have these

757
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,600
I wish people report on that I know there's other stuff but that was a really fun that's a really fun

758
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,880
Piece of art

759
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Our past

760
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
And I when I realized

761
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Guffawed

762
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Play Everly

763
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,608
How people just don't go away

764
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
Keep doing b*******

765
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,056
Call me episode is sometimes a good thing but sometimes

766
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
About that

767
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Tell a story

768
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Covering

769
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,040
I was like I don't know enough about Jack burkman

770
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
I know dude

771
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,256
I'd like to go back in time and retroactively affordable

772
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,680
If you go back and listen at all episode in a week and I'll have like a little

773
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,496
Combo breaker

774
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Propaganda

775
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,944
Nearly the amount of time to go back and find no idea

776
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,504
When you got her back

777
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
The miac report is a super big

778
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Piece of Alex Jones

779
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,720
This current mood but

780
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
He also has a story that he

781
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
He pitched on

782
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
Heard it on Monday

783
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Where he has been

784
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
Forced volunteering bill

785
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Baby Feud

786
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
If you recall

787
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Alex

788
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Is reporting on

789
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
The introduced version

790
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Of the bill as opposed to

791
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Cast version

792
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
The bill that had the

793
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,944
The sort of mandatory service

794
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Stripped out

795
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
This is never a good I

796
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
He's lying

797
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Entirely about

798
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
But he brings it up again

799
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Amanda

800
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
Has evolved over the course of a couple days

801
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
This is so much scarier now

802
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:06,912
Country on Obama has started all of this

803
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
Flawlessly

804
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,312
Like relay runners

805
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:19,968
That they are going to have martial law in the states and cities

806
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,744
Civilian Army

807
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
1824

808
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:45,056
Including warzones so

809
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,640
Define love

810
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,320
Or they will decide what you're going to be in you will serve

811
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,904
No Doubt

812
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:08,352
Mayor of New York

813
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,400
Love you man

814
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:15,264
Another another like uses reading that that martial law

815
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
When connecting it

816
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,384
24

817
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
You we need you to volunteer

818
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,992
There's alot going on we need you to build home

819
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
We need you to build Gardens

820
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
We need you to fix

821
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,624
Road

822
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
It's very complicated cuz what he's doing now is he trying to combine

823
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
Different things

824
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Seem like the same thing

825
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,360
He's talking about like he mentioned at the department of

826
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Defense Direct

827
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,455
In there and then talked about it

828
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
Figure out where he's getting

829
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,319
All that other stuff

830
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,183
Some of the things about like warzones and stuff like that from the Department of Defense

831
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,255
Able to talk about

832
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
The house is that stripped-down version

833
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
Of what was it house resolution

834
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
1388

835
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
So like

836
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,031
Play fast and loose with all these details

837
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,335
Pretending

838
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
It's all crazy

839
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,247
So it's great work on his part

840
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
F******

841
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
Bulshit out of

842
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
Have a full picture talk about that

843
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,775
Infowars

844
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,335
January 30th

845
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,663
Defense department civilian expeditionary Force

846
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
Builder

847
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:06,367
Exercise

848
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
1404

849
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:13,535
Management Authority direct and assign civilian employee voluntary or involuntary

850
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Domestically or internationally

851
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
Now happened

852
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,527
I think there's one word that Alex is hoping you didn't hear in there

853
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
And that is

854
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Employee

855
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,671
Yeah because this is about DOD employees

856
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:47,071
Mandatory

857
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:52,191
They call them civilian employees cuz there's a lot of people in the military work for the dod

858
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
Civilian employee doesn't mean citizen of the United States

859
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,847
Transcribed into service for the.

860
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
It's a non-military Personnel who work for the defense

861
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
Department contract

862
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
So it's

863
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
If you look at this cuz you can fine also

864
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
If it is

865
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,623
If it is

866
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
Edit YouTube videos right

867
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
What kind of idiot would you

868
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,535
Grab some random person and be like I had now

869
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,679
It would take for money to train them

870
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,615
It is the dod directive 1404 like 8 you can find it

871
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
I read it

872
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
Ava Lincoln

873
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,735
You want it it's all just about employees

874
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:43,135
Because it says mandatory or like willing or unwilling

875
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,183
Reassignment and stuff like that

876
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
And he doesn't

877
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
Read what came right

878
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Before that

879
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
In the tack

880
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,911
DOD civilian employees in ee or positions may be directed

881
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,447
Accept employment requirements of

882
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
The position

883
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,799
However whenever possible the dod civilian expeditionary Workforce

884
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
Will be asked to to serve

885
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
Expeditionary requirements

886
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Voluntarily

887
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
Now the important thing there is

888
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
GE means emergency

889
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Essential

890
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,343
PE means non-combat essential which is to say that the position

891
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
This is entirely about

892
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,719
Essential position

893
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,815
And how we will try to accommodate you as best as possible to be voluntary

894
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
But because he's

895
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
Position versus Central

896
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:28,191
We might have to reorganize in such a way where you go to a position

897
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,727
You don't necessarily want to be

898
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
And if you don't want to be in that

899
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
Guess what

900
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Because you are Adam

901
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Employee

902
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
You can quit

903
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
You don't have to go

904
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,015
That is true

905
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
But they do also

906
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
The the civilian expeditionary work

907
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
Except volunteer

908
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,487
If you go to their website and you read their FAQ page

909
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:57,119
There is a question as a volunteer are there any negative consequences if I decline an opportunity

910
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
The answer

911
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,215
You cannot be direct

912
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:05,567
50 serve in Expedition

913
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Also there's a

914
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:14,015
Almost like all of these people have already thought of the things that he's going to b**** about and it written

915
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:18,623
Into the rules

916
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,439
I need to go to the website there's a list of the

917
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
Intensive training requirement

918
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
You have to undergo

919
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Indisposition

920
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
Pretty high-paying position

921
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:33,215
Like these aren't something worth

922
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,519
You know whatever

923
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
Article

924
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
At the beginning of the article quotes

925
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
What is established

926
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:48,575
Civilian expeditionary Workforce CC American civilians trained overseas in support of the worldwide

927
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
Carrie Mitchum

928
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
Problem

929
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,695
DOD directive 1404 10

930
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,279
Is really just an updating of an already existing directive

931
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,583
You can easily find a version of it from 90

932
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,143
E92 which still explicitly includes

933
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,935
Nearly identical language about the

934
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
The deployment of Civilian employees of the Department of Defense

935
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
Also I found one

936
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,311
Brumate

937
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
Is from April 1992

938
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
We can't even say Bobwhite

939
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:20,063
Also I found a revision of their there regarding

940
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,671
Department 1988 you can find online

941
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:31,583
Employee non-military

942
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Script

943
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,959
Putting these people in secret damn that's why we don't know

944
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,007
Where so many people are right now

945
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
Missing persons cases

946
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,591
No

947
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,223
Forced conscription into play

948
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,319
Understand or wherever they want to go

949
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
Bill that he's lying about

950
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,415
In the house

951
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,487
Reporting on a different version of the bill then pass

952
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,119
Department of Defense directive 1404

953
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,703
Which doesn't say not explaining

954
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,495
What's the villion workforce

955
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:15,871
Because it serves its purpose of like Obama is going to come

956
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,687
You can take your kids and then they're going to sassy with the dinner table

957
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
Brakes

958
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
This b*******

959
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
It's completely

960
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:27,903
You connecting to live into a bigger lie it's

961
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,695
Obama's going to come to your home

962
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
He's going to give you

963
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Training

964
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
And he's going to pay you $40,000 a year

965
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,935
Whatever is another aspect of this I want to talk about

966
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,727
And that is in the midst

967
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
2000

968
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Volunteerism was really hot

969
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
It was really hot

970
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
Because I went to the University of Missouri

971
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,711
I worked at the office of service-learning

972
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,039
And that was a department within the University

973
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
That's absolutely true

974
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:03,999
Entire job because there was funding for service-based

975
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
Curriculum

976
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,839
What's the go through the entire catalog of course

977
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
University of Missouri

978
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,215
Could have a volunteer aspect

979
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
Added to the course

980
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,311
Play like a pulmonary science

981
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
Something like that

982
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,431
There's an easy application of 5 hours a week

983
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
Or something like that

984
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
University

985
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,903
Grants and things like that in order to we volunteerism into the

986
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,207
The curriculum of classes where it was

987
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,023
I know because I was involved in

988
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
Creating the catalog

989
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
Of course it's worthy service-learning Department

990
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
It wasn't

991
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,167
Something nefarious

992
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
There were many times where I was

993
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
Stretching

994
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,311
Maybe this good

995
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,359
That's not really applicable to the course

996
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:56,991
It was hot in the sense of like this idea that paradigm

997
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,927
Department there was this idea of

998
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
We have an opportunity

999
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,767
Me to get people to help

1000
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,047
Where they

1001
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
Volunteer their time

1002
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
Which is a positive thing

1003
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,423
Sing for everybody

1004
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
Doing those things

1005
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
It's not some

1006
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Evil thing

1007
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,519
About what year was that

1008
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
2007

1009
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,919
Missouri

1010
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
Still into town Tamagotchi

1011
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Ciproud

1012
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:34,367
I was qualified to work at that apartment fire

1013
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
Girlfriend's mom

1014
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
Department

1015
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Nice time

1016
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
An interesting work

1017
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,423
Alex

1018
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Probably

1019
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,239
See something very nefarious behind

1020
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
That

1021
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
And it was

1022
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,335
Dislike these moves

1023
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
Push the pushes towards volume

1024
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
Tourism in stuff like that

1025
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
It was happening

1026
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,479
Before Obama got in office

1027
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
I mean

1028
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,575
But I believe they is like you were saying

1029
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,599
A lot of Grants

1030
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Encouraged

1031
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Shirts

1032
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Do this

1033
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Yeah I mean

1034
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,767
Donnelly University

1035
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,815
But the university got

1036
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
Money in order to

1037
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,679
You know it was it they way would they got money in order to convince

1038
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
People that bought

1039
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Which is interesting

1040
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:28,383
About it I think positive

1041
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,943
Yeah you could also have really positive

1042
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,735
Experiences

1043
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,063
Truecaller

1044
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
I think there's a lot of people in the world

1045
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,487
Like

1046
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,303
Cuz you got to find a place you believe in

1047
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
You got to go through process those like

1048
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,911
You don't know if it's

1049
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,727
Put on a cloak

1050
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
I don't know

1051
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Tearing that you need a cloak

1052
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,687
I couldn't come up with the word April

1053
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
This is all hot.

1054
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
Experience

1055
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:18,559
It was a little overwrought and it was like an interesting new pair of paradigm

1056
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,167
Education a little bit more gung-ho necessarily then

1057
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,007
I don't understand

1058
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
Hey someone who lived in a tight

1059
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
But

1060
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Stupid

1061
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
We already had

1062
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
Steve

1063
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
Who sells out

1064
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,575
Yeah

1065
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Rather Financial

1066
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
Doan's going considerably higher

1067
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
This is the only place to go with

1068
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
Money isn't golden store

1069
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
There are no more alternative

1070
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
Your money

1071
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:06,175
Golden silver Communications

1072
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
The communications Network as a

1073
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
Marketing arm

1074
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
Word Midas

1075
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
Noahide

1076
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,367
Idea how great

1077
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,767
Now they want to do any of that

1078
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:27,167
My Bitcoin back then

1079
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:32,031
At this point

1080
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,335
Own a cryptocurrency

1081
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,615
The outlet

1082
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
Is over and over again

1083
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:45,599
You already know that he's going to show up when I play like

1084
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,695
Eclipse from now

1085
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
He's there to service

1086
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,327
Fake expert about the account

1087
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,375
A bunch of s*** about how terrible

1088
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,031
So here's the part of it where to tell you

1089
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
South

1090
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
That gold was the place to go

1091
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,223
We left that to our buddies

1092
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
Whoops

1093
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
To doodle

1094
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
Horrible prediction

1095
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743
Things for the future

1096
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
This is right after Alex

1097
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
Controlled him

1098
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,071
His stories about the e

1099
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:30,655
Evils of volunteerism and volunteer there

1100
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:36,031
There's a rumor in the bill is past the house on its way for sure Passage

1101
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,127
Beginning of Terranea

1102
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,175
People that write about it

1103
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
Recurring all the places

1104
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
Did you mention

1105
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Just now

1106
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
And John

1107
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
The plans

1108
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
Being put in place

1109
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
How long will it take

1110
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,159
I think maybe

1111
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
Week

1112
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,327
Coronavirus

1113
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Centex here

1114
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
And

1115
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
By the end of the year

1116
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
And I don't

1117
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
Think that's enough

1118
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
To get people cranked up

1119
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,847
And so I think

1120
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
Sometime during 20

1121
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
10

1122
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
Demonstrations are going to be

1123
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
Happening in America in

1124
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:23,391
Turn off my timing belt

1125
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
I think they're going to

1126
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,231
Wait at cookout your own prediction there at the end

1127
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:31,327
Really bold the world is going to end

1128
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:37,727
But I might be wrong I couldn't never know

1129
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:51,295
I would like the forecast

1130
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,671
If you think you might be wrong prediction

1131
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
Dickweed

1132
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Book jokes please date

1133
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Don't do that

1134
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:05,375
Don't you remember how Skilling always comes up. Doing the weather is like hated my ring

1135
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:09,727
Sometimes rain takes a little bit longer than you think

1136
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:16,127
You don't get to play these games and then likely like I'm going to give myself and Mike

00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
Summer of Rage

1140
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,487
Oldest

1141
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,535
You're a forecaster

1142
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,583
Talkington

1143
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,887
Who has already many times

1144
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,191
Can men be so wrong all the time

1145
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
It's crazier

1146
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,567
What they mean or you know when you save forecast

1147
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
After we think of it

1148
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
What they're talking about

1149
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Is they cast

1150
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,711
Forest

1151
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:58,367
Okay no thank you

1152
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
Agents for our bottle

1153
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,887
Does nonsense conversation about Alex's scared about everything

1154
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
Alex

1155
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,959
Bob about how manly

1156
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,591
Manly Bob look

1157
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:21,407
Alex

1158
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Canby

1159
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
Nobody's calling about

1160
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,807
Probably not

1161
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
Manly is s***

1162
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,647
Annamalai ambitious

1163
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,583
Yes you do

1164
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,519
I don't know

1165
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,383
Great answer Bob

1166
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,175
How much would it look

1167
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Bob

1168
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,991
You got it

1169
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:35,135
Getting paid pretty well not well enough to just sit there through

1170
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,279
I know there's others

1171
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
It could be really hard not to laugh

1172
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
I don't know

1173
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,895
Like maybe.

1174
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,943
Do that I don't really care it doesn't really care

1175
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,991
I do believe the part about him

1176
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,551
Overkill after he took them

1177
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
Conceivably

1178
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
Listen to like with Jon Ronson

1179
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
Testimony

1180
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,231
About what happened

1181
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,023
Mangrove

1182
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
Lying about everything

1183
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
Complete lies

1184
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,935
Like his coverage

1185
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,263
Defend himself

1186
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,103
So real

1187
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,151
Weird

1188
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:34,015
Murder in that guy one time

1189
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
So here's the park

1190
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,855
Depends I guess.

1191
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
Gold sales

1192
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
This part is a little bit more

1193
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
Giant days

1194
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,815
About $60 to get side

1195
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,631
Today was off 280

1196
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
Something like that which is miniscule

1197
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
And we'll probably have a soft day on Monday

1198
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,031
But next week is going higher

1199
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,527
On the Franks and on the

1200
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,319
Sovereign

1201
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,207
Montana gold

1202
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,655
Now I have to put a block on selling out of

1203
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,591
And not many people do this Ted

1204
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
It was a stroke of Genius

1205
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,503
Yeah I'm right here Alex

1206
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,831
I don't know about the stroke of Genius because

1207
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,183
Figure out that have gold drops right now with

1208
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,975
What's going on in Washington DC

1209
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
Alright whatever

1210
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:53,119
I can't imagine I can't imagine anybody listening to this

1211
01:00:54,655 --> 01:01:00,799
Completely passive way cuz I can understand

1212
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Episode of this show

1213
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,871
I'm not being like

1214
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
Just

1215
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,503
The Bob Chapman Ted Anderson

1216
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
Vinny Appice I guess

1217
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,343
Those little set-pieces alone should be like

1218
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,879
Can't trust these dudes

1219
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:21,279
Even not knowing that might not knowing that a couple years later

1220
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:25,887
After this point Anderson will have his license taken away

1221
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
Dishonest Trading

1222
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,263
Even not knowing those things you just hear

1223
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:40,735
This will get you into the free card

1224
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,695
It's so crazy

1225
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
Broken listen to this and drop you like

1226
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,047
I think they're trying to find marks

1227
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
Is not

1228
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,631
It's not crazy to me at all

1229
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
It's sad

1230
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,263
Bad how utterly believable

1231
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
To know that he's gay

1232
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,831
I should wait until Monday

1233
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,367
And then

1234
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,047
What you said

1235
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Right now

1236
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,495
The others like I understand

1237
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,799
You know the game is

1238
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
They're playing on

1239
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,103
4 years of the economic collapse

1240
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,919
So you buy the gold it really matter how much it goes up

1241
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,479
Is the dollar going to collapse worth

1242
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,575
Broadway

1243
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
Yeah you will have to

1244
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Take a bite out of

1245
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,815
Understand

1246
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:02,143
They're framing playing on in order to

1247
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,935
Yeah

1248
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
Like Bob is coming in with like

1249
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
It was up 60

1250
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,031
Or whatever

1251
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
Because that's not enough

1252
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
To Mater

1253
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,639
For the kind of investors who are listening

1254
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,943
Like if you're listening

1255
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
Probably couldn't afford an ounce of gold

1256
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,623
800 something dollars and it goes up 60

1257
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,183
Are you just going to sell it then and then you've made

1258
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
$60

1259
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
I don't think

1260
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,047
The investment in Gold doesn't make sense

1261
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
No

1262
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:36,703
It really doesn't of the economics

1263
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,983
Which is why that's

1264
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,287
The selling point that they use as opposed to like

1265
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,615
It being a smart investment you can make a little bit of money

1266
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,407
It's not just that but it's also

1267
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:48,735
By preying upon his audience which is not

1268
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,783
I'm going to go out on a limb and say billionaires

1269
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,575
By praying on these people

1270
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
They are

1271
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,415
Scrambling together $800

1272
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,487
They think it's going to last

1273
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767
Last forever and it's going to go up

1274
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
Austin eventually

1275
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Going to be worth it

1276
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
+ 2

1277
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,655
It feels good to own a little bit of gold

1278
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,495
I can understand that

1279
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:14,079
At the very least you're like oh well at least I've got this money in

1280
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:14,847
Invest it

1281
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,407
Yeah there's there's something to that

1282
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,199
The deceitful awful

1283
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,503
Fraud

1284
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,039
No other word for it this is

1285
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,415
It's like it makes you feel like if you've ever had

1286
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,951
Like a bunch of cash in your

1287
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
Even if it's

1288
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
Nothing to

1289
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,655
800

1290
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,703
In your hand

1291
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Very attractive

1292
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
Do a lot of people

1293
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,567
Maybe

1294
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,687
Buy it baby

1295
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:54,015
Moving on from Bob Chapman

1296
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Display

1297
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,599
Alex has another guest

1298
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
Is very excited

1299
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
And talk

1300
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,231
Her name is Amy Allen

1301
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
And she is a musician

1302
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:09,887
She wrote a song called Ron Paul

1303
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:20,383
Alright alright I forgot about this photo Taylor Swift

1304
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,991
Taylor Swift

1305
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,319
Of the past

1306
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
Apparently during Ron Paul

1307
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
2008

1308
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:40,607
Thing it was like a big anthem of his campaign

1309
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:49,567
Now there's some interesting elements of Amy Allen that I'm going to get into as we discussed

1310
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,151
1

1311
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,223
Because

1312
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,783
Alex wants to talk about how she got

1313
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,135
No she was a victim of an assault

1314
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
Alex wants to

1315
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,719
To talk about that

1316
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
A lot

1317
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,767
And I think

1318
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
Not great

1319
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,655
But also I want to make clear before we get into any of this I do believe that

1320
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,935
She was the victim of a crime

1321
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,751
Yeah and I'm not in any way minimizing that

1322
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,543
And I'm not making fun of her

1323
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
For being attacked

1324
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
I do believe that

1325
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,687
Yeah I don't believe a lot of the window dressing

1326
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
People

1327
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
Like Alex Jones

1328
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
And other folks

1329
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,343
Have put on

1330
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
I assume she

1331
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,903
She's going to be explained

1332
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
A little

1333
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,975
Maybe

1334
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
2

1335
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,143
How quickly Alex wants to

1336
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,423
To talk about

1337
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,823
Where's the rail

1338
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,431
Who want Liberty wants to understand that we have a new world order taking over

1339
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,503
Our nation and they're very afraid of popular culture

1340
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:06,367
Further popularizing the message of Liberty

1341
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:12,255
Towards doing that for South by Southwest

1342
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:16,351
They're coming up with her but it's great to have you here in Austin Texas

1343
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,375
Thank you so much

1344
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,703
There was

1345
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,239
Talking about

1346
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
I still

1347
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
Continuing

1348
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
Los Angeles

1349
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,639
There was actually Fullerton for the Tea Party

1350
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,687
And 15,000 people came out

1351
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
Protest the tax increases

1352
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
Shut down the

1353
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,951
Ad campaign for Liberty Rumpole should have been present

1354
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:02,687
No

1355
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:07,551
I'm not going to go along with it is it really Multicultural

1356
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,439
Documents

1357
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,887
I'll bring the international crime syndicate to Justice now

1358
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,335
Warrior

1359
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,511
10-minute and 3-second

1360
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
To talking with her in order to

1361
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
To bring up this

1362
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,703
Which is a little quick I think it interview possibly

1363
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,495
Unless that's all you want to talk about

1364
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,055
Yeah

1365
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,847
Instantly goes to

1366
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,407
Talk about this party

1367
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
Through the prism of okay

1368
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,759
Cuz that's where he's at

1369
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,063
Because that sort of

1370
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,087
Confirm

1371
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,391
Some of the feelings we had on the last episode

1372
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,415
Chipotle

1373
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,231
I'm not making this up he really wants

1374
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
What's the talk about that beat

1375
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
A lot

1376
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,887
And I'm not stealing anything

1377
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
It was very bizarre

1378
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
I mean there's three of us

1379
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,287
And they pushed

1380
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,359
My friend out of the way

1381
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
To Target

1382
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,967
My head and face

1383
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
Is my mouth

1384
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:43,807
The crowbar

1385
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:59,167
I had time to cash the dump. A person telling them to take our money

1386
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,447
And

1387
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
Victim

1388
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
I think

1389
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,735
I think they were I don't know they were

1390
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
Mexican gang members

1391
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:21,183
That looks like the government or somebody hired him or it was a gang initiation

1392
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,535
The only two options

1393
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,143
Someone hired a government

1394
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,751
Vines to the government

1395
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
One hired him

1396
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
And I okay

1397
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:41,919
I don't know what happened here obviously I have no idea I can only go based on her telling of

1398
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,735
The event and

1399
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:49,599
Amy broke the story today on the Alex Jones Show online Internet show

1400
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,439
She says the police told her the attackers were most likely illegal in

1401
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,999
Investigate the brutal attack

1402
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:00,863
Amy was leaving the recording studio in Downtown LA with thugs attacked her at random

1403
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,423
They're simply looking for a white person to attack

1404
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,263
I believe that Amy was the victim of an assault and I think that's horrible

1405
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,567
However I take issue with all this time

1406
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
People make about this

1407
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,359
Situation

1408
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,175
Racially-motivated attack

1409
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,223
Against her because she was a white woman

1410
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,759
That was from Stormfront

1411
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
New World Order

1412
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:24,671
Amy was told not to talk about revolution in her music

1413
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
And she refused

1414
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,255
So they sent a Latino hit squad The Punisher

1415
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
My problem with that is that

1416
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:34,399
Album was called I would start a revolution if I could get up in the morning

1417
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,983
The first thing on the album was literally just titled Revolution

1418
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,055
News produced by goddamn Randy Jackson and Mark Ronson

1419
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,895
One of the album featured appearance by Pharoahe Monch

1420
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
School in 2002

1421
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
He had it

1422
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,247
Also the attack

1423
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,271
Happened in 2000

1424
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
Who's six years after

1425
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,903
She put out an album called I would start a revolution

1426
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,927
If I could get up in

1427
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,743
In the morning World Order Alex Jones

1428
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,511
Or putting out

1429
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,327
This idea that you was threatened because

1430
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,375
She Wrote a Song

1431
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,167
Putting up music they had revolution in

1432
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,447
Which is known

1433
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
It's absolute nonsense

1434
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,751
It is

1435
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
Absolutely using

1436
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
As a prompt

1437
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
It's gross

1438
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,919
It's really really gross

1439
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
I feel

1440
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:29,183
The whole album was tracks were produced by Mark and Randy Jackson

1441
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,559
Play with journey

1442
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
Play bass

1443
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,911
I'm dirty like some shows

1444
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,567
That

1445
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
Absolutely

1446
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
I feel really

1447
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
I feel bad

1448
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,015
I feel bad for her being in this situation

1449
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,575
Where there is entire world trying to

1450
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,903
Galvanized race-based hatred

1451
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,463
Order new world order fear

1452
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,999
Based on

1453
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,071
Did her being the victim of a crime it really

1454
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Imagine

1455
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
Any scenario

1456
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
I can't imagine

1457
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
Did any historical

1458
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,007
Scenario where rabble-rousing

1459
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,031
People would

1460
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,871
Take the attack of a woman and then

1461
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
Turn it into a reason

1462
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
To demonize the population

1463
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,967
That seems

1464
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
Crazy

1465
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:31,391
We haven't seen that since a couple months ago

1466
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
In order to do harm to a larger

1467
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,255
Community of minority

1468
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Exercise

1469
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,839
It is a sick bomber and

1470
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,863
Everyone

1471
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
Losers

1472
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
Except for Alex

1473
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
Bike rack

1474
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,311
You can even hear it in her voice when he was asking what these people looked like she had a reticence to talk about

1475
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,895
Really didn't want to say because I think there was a sense that you like

1476
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,943
What is going to come of me

1477
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,503
Describing the these people

1478
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,295
Alex is probably going

1479
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
Play something off-color

1480
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:05,183
Or it could end up being reported on Stormfront as a race attack

1481
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
I think she had some kind of awareness of it

1482
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
Because

1483
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,047
I need to tell you

1484
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,839
Amy Allen is not

1485
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,119
Somebody who's unaware of

1486
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:13,887
These worlds

1487
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
How do you wake up to the New World Order

1488
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Well

1489
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,031
Montana

1490
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,591
It's a little bit like

1491
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,895
Since I was a kid

1492
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,271
Raised

1493
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
Raise

1494
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063
With that

1495
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,719
As a small child

1496
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Enter.

1497
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,143
So

1498
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
Amy Allen

1499
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:52,287
Was born in 1982 and was raised

1500
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,335
Paranoid family

1501
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:59,199
Oh no I thought you I thought you were about to know I thought you were about to like save it

1502
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
You're done some research

1503
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,015
Since you was raised like a

1504
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,039
Literal sepehr

1505
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,319
This group hold on

1506
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,367
No

1507
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,439
Paranoid about the New World Order

1508
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
Inman

1509
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
Tana

1510
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,303
Is Montana along with Idaho

1511
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,887
White nationalist separatist communities in the 1990

1512
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,727
81bay standoff

1513
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:25,567
For the FBI after the land where they would hold their mock trials was foreclosed

1514
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,127
The militia of Montana was Super Active

1515
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,711
Ideology is shockingly similar to Alex's

1516
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,527
And a little Glimpse that we get into Amy's family of origin

1517
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:39,135
It'd be impossible to make any definitive claim based on this little bit of info that we have

1518
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,207
But the fact that Amy describes her mother's belief system this way

1519
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:48,863
The timeline and the fact that they were in an unspecified town in Montana leads me to believe there's a high likelihood that a negro

1520
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,143
White nationalist militia

1521
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,447
Again I can't say this for sure

1522
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,751
Those are some of the biggest signs pop

1523
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,567
Yeah the 1990s Montana

1524
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,895
Anti-government sentiments fear of the New World Order

1525
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,431
Those are all

1526
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,223
Those are red flags

1527
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,295
Yeah we're talking about Montana

1528
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,575
Chicago

1529
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,879
Thirsty

1530
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,183
12 people live in

1531
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,487
Nationalist

1532
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,279
Malicious

1533
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,863
Montana and Idaho

1534
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
It is

1535
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,471
Something that's very historically

1536
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
I'm not

1537
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,359
Her family absolutely

1538
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Part of that

1539
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,943
But you can't come from a family like that

1540
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,991
And not be aware of it

1541
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
It's pretty funny

1542
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,415
Oh you're the master race

1543
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:50,815
Well they could pay their bills but they were doing it by writing bad

1544
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,375
So that was kind of part of the problem

1545
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,287
Yeah the the Montana freedmen getting a lot of trouble for bank fraud

1546
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,567
Cuz they were just

1547
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,895
They just write the rent check

1548
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Text

1549
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:13,343
Supposed to represent real money

1550
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,111
It sound like

1551
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,391
Conservative

1552
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:19,487
I'm not saying anything about her based on what

1553
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,511
Context clues I can

1554
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
Glean

1555
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,559
For a family of four

1556
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,119
I'm just saying that I don't believe in any way

1557
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,191
Did someone who grew up in Montana in the 90s

1558
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:33,823
Wo does have somewhere nice of white nationalist militia

1559
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,359
Yeah it's almost impossible

1560
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,895
Which is why she had the

1561
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Instinctive

1562
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
I think so

1563
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Action of like

1564
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
I know

1565
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,551
Maybe

1566
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,575
I feel like I need

1567
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,111
To tell the truth but I

1568
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:46,879
Kind of get

1569
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,951
Like

1570
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,303
She's coming in and doesn't know what she's getting into his show and stuff like that

1571
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,375
But I do think it's possible to live in a space where

1572
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,471
You are in Turon Paul and you do want to audit the Fed

1573
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,495
And maybe your

1574
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,519
Willingly

1575
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,103
Blind to some of the others

1576
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,639
You just have the

1577
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,199
Privilege involved in your life where you don't need

1578
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:15,039
Unpack

1579
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,319
And we're fans of Alec

1580
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
What's Jones in 2009

1581
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
Want

1582
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,719
You know like it was

1583
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,511
Like I'm just waking up

1584
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,119
There were a lot of liberals

1585
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:29,887
Shemar Moore

1586
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:37,311
The next clip is just her talking more about her mom that's kind of the same things

1587
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Stockpiling

1588
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,871
Food

1589
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:46,527
Intuit

1590
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,855
This mixed with

1591
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,159
Is something that tells me

1592
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,951
That

1593
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,511
He doesn't know her audience as well as she

1594
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,351
My plan is to do tea party

1595
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
But the album

1596
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,911
Lot of reggae

1597
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,943
Tea party and notoriously

1598
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,575
Kerry Cassidy

1599
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,599
Huge

1600
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:25,951
2009

1601
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
Cheese

1602
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
Security party

1603
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,023
You could not be less

1604
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,303
Reggae

1605
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,399
No I'm not not you

1606
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
I don't

1607
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,703
Stan Wiki

1608
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
What is the exact words

1609
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,079
It's using your mouth isn't it

1610
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
I don't

1611
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,127
How do you do that

1612
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,271
Any other way

1613
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,575
Wanting to talk about

1614
01:19:55,135 --> 01:20:01,279
All you're doing is super good job evidence

1615
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,447
So there's other ways to

1616
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,983
Talk about this

1617
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,519
Without

1618
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,055
Why

1619
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
Did you say that

1620
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:19,968
That's that's that's made out of someone else's

1621
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,992
And that's not fair

1622
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,272
I'm really ugly

1623
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
Here's what I

1624
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,856
I am going to tell you

1625
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
And I want you to feel

1626
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,328
We're done with that for now Alex

1627
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Accidentally

1628
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,888
Tell someone

1629
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
Dirty business

1630
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,240
Some of their dirty laundry gets aired on

1631
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,776
Alex's show

1632
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,800
In a way that I don't

1633
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,592
Person wants to know the public

1634
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:51,200
3 years

1635
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,480
Dollars

1636
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:59,392
And

1637
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,416
Anti-war

1638
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:04,000
The start of the war just to muzzle him

1639
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:16,032
I literally

1640
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,664
First of all this isn't true

1641
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,880
He signed a contract for $3000000

1642
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
Showed up to his first day on the job

1643
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:39,840
Ill-fitting suit

1644
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,312
Now you need to understand what we're going to do

1645
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,104
You're going to say what we

1646
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Tell you to say

1647
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,152
You're going to cover what we

1648
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,176
We tell you to cover it if

1649
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
You go off script

1650
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
For even a moment

1651
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
You are

1652
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
John

1653
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
You know what I mean

1654
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
Not going to do this

1655
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,416
Give me my money and I will go surf

1656
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:07,232
He's sold out the country for 9 million dollars

1657
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:13,632
I will just take all of my money for that

1658
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
Also please

1659
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,936
F****** consider

1660
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,032
He had been the mayor of Brooklyn Park Minnesota

1661
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,336
4 years already

1662
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,664
He was the f****** Governors Minnesota

1663
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:32,320
I think he would be Savvy enough to be like

1664
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,136
He's already super out

1665
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,184
Spoken weirdo

1666
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:43,584
The voice of the WWE app for a baby with a professional wrestler who is a Marine

1667
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,144
Professional wrestlers are understanding contracts

1668
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:51,008
Massive career up till that point already

1669
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
Let's

1670
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,104
Predator

1671
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,224
Governor of a state

1672
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,296
A picture

1673
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:09,696
So is this is true that I was intentionally

1674
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,744
Really feel like that the breach of contract

1675
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,304
Also I mean

1676
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,120
Could actually look at his

1677
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
His book

1678
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,936
Is a bibliography

1679
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,960
You could say

1680
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
Works out

1681
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:29,152
Cuz I'm 2002e wrote a book called Jesse Ventura tells it like it is America's most outspoken Governor speaks out

1682
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,200
They didn't write another book

1683
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
2000

1684
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,296
That's 6 years not

1685
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,320
3

1686
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,368
That's confusing

1687
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,672
Yes already said

1688
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952
All all

1689
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
All of your unspoken

1690
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,144
It's really hard to name books to because I'm 20120 talk Democrats and Republicans

1691
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,384
Democrats and Republicans

1692
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:08,064
I was public Republic

1693
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:11,648
Stop the name books so

1694
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,464
Scenario

1695
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,888
Ventura took $9000000 in order to

1696
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,936
Do not speak out against the war that

1697
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:24,960
Philosophic

1698
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,264
We against and ended up leading to

1699
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,544
Conn's in tons

1700
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,568
Civilian deaths

1701
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,104
And so that makes him a

1702
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
Coward

1703
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,176
Worst case scenario autism

1704
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
That's the best-case scenario

1705
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:43,136
I don't think Jesse Ventura would appreciate it like this on air

1706
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Anyway

They start taking some calls

1710
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,144
And its first call its first its first color is

1711
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,192

Have a gun culture is a big issue Amy right now in the

1718
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Small town

The teachers

1723
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,800
Real Steel

1724

I know this guy man 7-Eleven

1730
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:02,240
Not literally Versailles Missouri

1731
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,776
I've spent some time

1732
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Around

1733
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:10,944

Yeah I know Dino

1740
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,280

1741
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,072
Who's the singer on I'm going to call

1742
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840

1743
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,120
About guns

1744
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,032
The gun culture vulture

1745
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:42,432
Gun culture is very important right now because I just got a report was very credible source

1746
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,504
They're trying to get kids to your dad

1747
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
You're bad

1748
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,552
I know for a fact

1749
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,832
Is not the

1750
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,648
Case because I've been to Versailles and

1751
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,672
Everybody

1752
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,512
Any place in Missouri

1753
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,560
Largely any City that

1754
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,328
But isn't

1755
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,096
Columbia

1756
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,144
St Louis or Kansas City

1757
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
Is going to be full of that guy

1758
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:08,288
Ulta

1759
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
Bulshit

1760
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
Paternalism

1761
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,848
Sick move of like

1762
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:21,088
I hear that

1763
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:21,856
Another Direction

1764
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
So they take another call

1765
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,048
Are the shows

1766
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,328
Missouri weird Direct

1767
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
PayPal

1768
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:35,424
Say thank you to you and Amy for doing a good job

1769
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,704
Patriots thank you

1770
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,544
Well she can read though that's the

1771
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,688
I just wanted to move on I want to try to

1772
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:56,416
I want to let you know about local or a 40p county to try to sneak this through it says the regulating to purchase ammunition

1773
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
And what it is

1774
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,512
When you start reading this it's on Albany county.com

1775
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,584
Right on the website you go to local while legislature

1776
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,144
And here I was going to read Section 5 real quick quick

1777
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,704
A record shall be kept by the jewelry

1778
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
Dealer of

1779
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,032
Each cell domination with your shoulder type caliber

1780
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,824
Quality ammunition sold

1781
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,384
Name and address of the person receiving the same

1782
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
The caliber

1783
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,944
Make model manufacture

1784
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,760
Name and serial number of the firearm which the purchase

1785
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,784
Pittsburgh

1786
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:30,208
Stop stop stop

1787
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:42,496
This is why we are always way ahead everything cuz he was got that

1788
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,544
If I understand correctly

1789
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,336
He is mad

1790
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
Because

1791
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,896
People are going to have to

1792
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:49,920
To write down

1793
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:50,944
Why he

1794
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
He's buying at me

1795
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,016
Curative goobot

1796
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,576
Good Records

1797
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
For like

1798
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,160
People shot today

1799
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,792
It would help

1800
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
Recently bought

1801
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:10,912
There's that you want to just take a

1802
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,216
Like a little step backwards

1803
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
Touchy about the idea of like

1804
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:21,408
Any kind of regulation of guns leads to a registration

1805
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,688
I'm fine with that

1806
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:27,040
I mean I know that people can enjoy guns recreationally and

1807
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:31,904
Do you know it's not an evil thing or scary or anything like that

1808
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,440
You know it is

1809
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,768
Like if you really look at it through things like

1810
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,536
Fertilizer

1811
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,840
But if you buy fertilizers

1812
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,608
Is it can be used

1813
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,960
There's a registry event

1814
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,544
Haven't LED

1815
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,640
To the nightmare scenarios that people like Alex

1816
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,432
Builders ideas like

1817
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:58,272
As soon as they ever record buddies fertilizer

1818
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,320
No one's taking anybody

1819
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,856
But his car is because of these

1820
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,160
These rules that we put in place to mitigate Danger

1821
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,976
You can't even buy that much allergy medication

1822
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,304
Two people taking away

1823
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
Or anything like that

1824
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Sudafed isn't

1825
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
Gone

1826
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,424
It's just better control

1827
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,984
So

1828
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,520
You can make a substance that can

1829
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,592
It's almost like we should know

1830
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,616
I don't

1831
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,408
This is that cray

1832
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,224
This proposed law in Albany

1833
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,064
We'll get more into that here in a second

1834
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
Because Alex

1835
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,112
You can hear it

1836
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,648
He's freaking out

1837
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
Furniture

1838
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,840
Is Rhino lumiguard Schenectady

1839
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:50,240
That's right

1840
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:21,728
Albany county.com Department legislature

1841
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:34,528
Revolution 108 local law number 84 2009

1842
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:37,088
Do you have trouble sleeping

1843
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,256
That is rough cut off in the middle of emergency by a hard day

1844
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,328
Do you have trouble

1845
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,608
So

1846
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,400
You can see there

1847
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,448
Hear the wheels turning in his head

1848
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,240
I was like oh my God

1849
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,288
Connect this to the Schenectady story

1850
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,664
This is amazing

1851
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
Combined

1852
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,128
Give us the coordinates for this

1853
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:35,200
Albany New York surrounding counties

1854
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:37,760
Federal martial law

1855
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:41,856
He In that clip was 30 seconds long said I haven't read

1856
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,648
Screenshot

1857
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,184
Also this is connected

1858
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,000
This thing I don't know anything about it

1859
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
Little bit

1860
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,816
This guy is that on

1861
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:59,008
It's email this to Rob do after I've reported the story

1862
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
What if it wasn't

1863
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:06,432
What's this called was making it up he's reported that it's connected to this other live in your belly

1864
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:10,016
Because from what I can tell it didn't pass

1865
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,320
Regulation

1866
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,624
Completely legal and not violate the Second Amendment

1867
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
The dead past

1868
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,744
All I really want to point out here is absolutely not breaking the scoop

1869
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:26,144
You can find an article about the proposed law that was posted on the NRA's website that uses the exact using

1870
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,472
And likes to the URL that he's trying to read Alex on air

1871
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,800
That post was from the morning of March 20th 2009

1872
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,824
This isn't the scoop

1873
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,384
It's just Alex picking up NRA sloppy seconds

1874
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:41,760
Most importantly that's nothing to do with the story that Alex is misrepresenting a disconnected

1875
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:45,600
Those titties are about half an hour away by car

1876
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,368
Good traffic

1877
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
Turn up

1878
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:47,904
SimCity

1879
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,976
Schenectady is in Schenectady County where is albinism Albany

1880
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,280
Not even in the same

1881
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:58,912
The goddamn thing nearest Publix

1882
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,216
Is gerrymandering

1883
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,776
He's just shoot-from-the-hip

1884
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,080
Don't you remember what happened

1885
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:12,480
Obama smart martial law martial law

1886
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,832
Took over Albany

1887
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,536
Congratulations

1888
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:32,448
I have it ready training

1889
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:44,736
Martial law

1890
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,672
The next week but

1891
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:03,680
Tour with your wig to remember

1892
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,472
Going back is not your friend

1893
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,008
A b

1894
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,640
So interesting Lee what you have here

1895
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,944
Is Alex Jones starting to Broughton

1896
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,528
By talking about how he's always right and everyone attacks

1897
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
For being

1898
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:24,672
Right all the time cuz the truth comes out and he was right all along but he's up against that barbed wire and I once climbed over him

1899
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,720
Now towards the end of the show he gets

1900
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,024
These two stories that he's juggling

1901
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:34,912
Any runs with it without reading anything about it

1902
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,192
And that back

1903
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:36,960
Landscape

1904
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:38,752
So self-satisfied like

1905
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:43,104
I have now done my work and they will attack proven right

1906
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872
It's it

1907
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,408
Almost like a perfect

1908
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,688
Narrative Arc

1909
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:52,320
Like you set up the theme of the show at the beginning of I am unjustly demonized for being right all the time

1910
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,112
And now at the end here

1911
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,440
Demonstrated that he's right all the time now

1912
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,720
I welcome the attack

1913
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:02,560
Meanwhile people

1914
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,888
And they laugh and they say that I'm not a real journalist

1915
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,448
What is journalism

1916
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,984
But hearing a call

1917
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,544
Not getting any confirmation and Reporting it

1918
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,312
It's true

1919
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,104
Actually name the clip Alex

1920
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,384
Congratulate himself

1921
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,688
We're doing 0ja

1922
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,760
So many things you should have

1923
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,784
Call Schenectady

1924
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,832
You should have had robbed

1925
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,392
Miseno's the area haven't call Albany

1926
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:30,464
Call the people who are listed in the press release

1927
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:33,792
Like it's not hard that would be doing if you're trying to

1928
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,328
Report accurately

1929
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,144
If you want to spend these Yarns

1930
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,960
About like oh this is all no takeover

1931
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:47,360
What you do is you still called they give you no comment then you report that they gave you no comment

1932
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,640
That's what you do

1933
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,920
And then is it

1934
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:55,552
Reported they gave no comment that sounds suspicious to the people that you want to

1935
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,320
Sounds

1936
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:59,392
Step one

1937
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,416
Crazy

1938
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,720
Awful

1939
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:11,424
Just because you didn't have a song about the gun

1940
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,544
It shouldn't

1941
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,128
F***

1942
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,944
You

1943
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,224
Studio after this

1944
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,832
There's a lot of

1945
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,880
Just two clips

1946
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,648
The show

1947
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,208
Hotel

1948
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:34,976
India

1949
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,536
This idea of not reading thing

1950
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,864
Wallowing around

1951
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,144
In ignorance

1952
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,728
Presenting and masquerading itself as wisdom

1953
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,008
Is every

1954
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,568
All of these people in Alex Jones's world

1955
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:51,616
No matter how credibly they presented

1956
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,384
Themselves

1957
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,664
Are guilty of the exact

1958
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,200
So here's the first

1959
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,736
Where he talks about

1960
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,016
Obama's National

1961
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:10,048
Specifically

1962
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,632
This is Barack Obama's National Security advisor

1963
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:18,240
Okay

1964
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,336
It's right off

1965
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,872
The Council on Foreign Relations

1966
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:28,224
Website is from the city of Pharr

1967
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,760
Show that the

1968
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,320
Do you think this quote

1969
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,856
And I'll say this

1970
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,160
I do not care to defend Kissinger

1971
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:40,512
Absolutely

1972
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,792
Even after he left

1973
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
It's formal position

1974
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,888
Especially whenever he was orchestrating

1975
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,960
The shift

1976
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,728
Complete bulshit

1977
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,520
If you read the opening remarks

1978
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,056
From James dork

1979
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,384
You find that he says quote

1980
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,200
As the most recent National Security advisor of the United

1981
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,504
Orders from Doctor Kissinger

1982
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,552
Filter down through General Brent

1983
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,112
And Sandy Berger who is also here

1984
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,904
We have a chain of command in the

1985
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,696
Security Council that exist today

1986
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:13,280
There's no indication from the transcript that he speaking literally

1987
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,608
Or if it's just a little wink-and-nod kind of joke to open the

1988
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,912
Even leaving that aside it's important

1989
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,448
Consider what he's actually saying

1990
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,520
Although won't rostro is technically the First National

1991
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,104
What that position

1992
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:28,896
After him

1993
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,176
Cambridge Skokie

1994
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,968
After him

1995
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,760
Well actually came too big

1996
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,808
Well we don't take orders from

1997
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,112
He had all kinds of wild ID

1998
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:44,000
So like there is this idea of

1999
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:47,584
It's not I don't think you literally about taking orders from them

2000
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,144
I think he's talking about these are the people who have died

2001
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,424
Define the position

2002
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,704
They set the precedent

2003
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,752
They've given us guidance on what it is

2004
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:59,616
We do right and I'm not naive enough

2005
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,384
To say that

2006
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,712
Those people weren't in some way

2007
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,480
Capacity

2008
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,760
Twerking

2009
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,856
It's pretty clear if you look at their arm

2010
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:10,880
There are indications

2011
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,208
Advise on

2012
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:16,512
Security Council

2013
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,536
The directory

2014
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,840
But I think it's a little bit of a stretch

2015
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,632
Literally

2016
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,192
Okay so what happened

2017
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,472
Kissinger says something

2018
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,776
Then he whispers and Brent scowcroft

2019
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,336
And then he goes and talks to Sandy Berger

2020
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,616
Who then tells me what to do

2021
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:35,456
Video crafted Burger

2022
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,272
The language indicates to me

2023
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,320
The filtering down is the lineage of the

2024
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,880
It's not this literal thing

2025
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,160
So Jim Morris

2026
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,720
Like I understand what

2027
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,584
I'm not going to

2028
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,120
I understand what you doing

2029
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,424
But you're demonstrating an inability to

2030
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,216
Wrestle with contacts

2031
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,264
Because also the rest of this speech

2032
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
CFR

2033
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,128
Was about the idea that he wanted to hell

2034
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,152
Appreciate the

2035
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,712
So there was a hearkening to Legacy

2036
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,992
The beginning of it

2037
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
Speaking to Waze

2038
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,320
That the modern challenges of the world

2039
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,880
Such that

2040
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,904
A different approach

2041
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,672
Might be necessary

2042
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:20,256
Element that exists

2043
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:23,072
Speech if you read it as a whole you cannot

2044
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,864
Ever use new

2045
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,400
Caulking

2046
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,704
You can't

2047
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,472
Do you can't do it

2048
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,496
They just

2049
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,520
Don't understand

2050
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,544
They can't read

2051
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,080
They don't understand

2052
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,896
You can't use a metaphor

2053
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:40,992
You can't even but you can't even pretend to use the metaphor otherwise Alex

2054
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
Confirm

2055
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Stroop

2056
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,624
Anyway it one more clip of Jim Marrs

2057
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,928
And it should show you kind of how he does his

2058
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:59,680
Frank I have not looked at leaving this post but I know that just from what I've seen and glancing over some of the

2059
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:03,520
Paragraphs in this proposed legislation

2060
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,568
He's going to mean you can't

2061
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,848
Have a

2062
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,920
I glanced

2063
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
Over

2064
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,968
Legislation

2065
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:12,992
You know

2066
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:18,368
Something that's notoriously easy to glance over at a little over

2067
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:26,816
Legalistic bulshit language inspections referring to other subsections

2068
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,608
A couple closet

2069
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,912
Well they're trying to get rid of your foot

2070
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,192
Garden

2071
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:38,592
They were just right of bills rid of your garden

2072
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:41,920
It's irresponsible to come on a show that is so

2073
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,688
Bad

2074
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:47,296
And say something like that you're like I haven't read any of his books

2075
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,368
You can't evergarden

2076
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:54,208
Like that's f****** stupid stupid

2077
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,744
Stupid

2078
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
This needs

2079
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,304
Very clear

2080
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:01,120
When you engage with legislation like that

2081
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,400
And you make

2082
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
Options

2083
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,496
About what it's talking about you end up wrong

2084
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
Almost all the time

2085
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:11,360
You can demonstrate this with Alex Jones his favorite subsection

2086
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,384
About chemtrail

2087
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:15,456
The one that if you just read one piece of it

2088
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
Sounds like

2089
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,504
I got this

2090
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,272
This is

2091
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,368
Anybody as long as it's a research

2092
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,928
If you only skim it and Yuri

2093
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,208
That section of it

2094
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,488
It looks that way

2095
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,536
Have to look at it

2096
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,840
Cuz there's another part that says

2097
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,376
That section there

2098
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,424
That you're reading that's scary

2099
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,496
Is subject to subsection that stays informed

2100
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,520
Consent of all four

2101
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
Required

2102
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,848
It does not work

2103
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:47,200
But there might be something in that legislation that sounds scary but there's another thing that

2104
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:49,504
Weekly invalidates whatever

2105
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,552
And that's almost always the case

2106
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,320
When I look into these

2107
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,344
Alright

2108
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
New

2109
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,392
Proposal for a

2110
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,208
If you're going to cover Legend

2111
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,280
And and claim that you're a jerk

2112
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:02,816
You have to

2113
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
The first

2114
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:04,864
Go to

2115
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,632
College

2116
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
Alex

2117
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,984
But

2118
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,264
Specifically

2119
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,544
Understand

2120
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,312
Pacific

2121
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
And then

2122
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,640
Continuing education hours

2123
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:22,528
If Alex's dad has to do that dentist

2124
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,600
Test proving that you understand the Civic

2125
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,136
Prosthetics is super bored

2126
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:30,464
And if you feel it then you don't get to talk

2127
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,512
It's against the law to get your journalism license

2128
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,536
VRBO

2129
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,816
Civics is super important

2130
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,864
Because like

2131
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Or even if

2132
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,704
Well not lying

2133
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,520
How bills are passed

2134
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,288
What

2135
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,824
Mean and stuff like that

2136
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,872
He couldn't spend most of the stories that

2137
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:54,272
Like these ideas what he has now that he's talking about like also if they succeed in suing me the Sandy Hook family

2138
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,808
Ensuing me

2139
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,832
The first

2140
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,112
Amendments gone

2141
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,976
Which anybody has a basic understanding of

2142
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:03,744
How are

2143
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,536
Government operates

2144
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:06,816
But you know what

2145
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:09,120
I'm actually starting to think that law isn't Arab

2146
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,960
What affects about how easy that would make getting rid of fox

2147
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,496
Because if you have

2148
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,032
Vegetation requirement

2149
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,616
Then you can prove

2150
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:21,920
They're lying about

2151
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,992
Plausible deniability

2152
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:28,320
Keyboard

2153
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:32,928
You know that because they are out

2154
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:37,280
To pass a test

2155
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,560
We already know that

2156
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:40,864
Confirm

2157
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
Exactly

2158
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,424
But now there's no

2159
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,984
There's a lot that says you got to

2160
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,056
Define let's regulate

2161
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,896
I have Alex freak out about it

2162
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:57,504
March 22nd

2163
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,784
Not worth talking about

2164
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,808
So that's off the table

2165
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:03,136
But I really think I wish that that those Jim Morris

2166
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,696
Important and demonstrative

2167
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,976
How stupid ever wanted

2168
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,000
And how

2169
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:10,304
Fast and loose they are with details

2170
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,864
Intelligence reports

2171
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,632
Leaving about

2172
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,400
I think it's important

2173
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,680
But I wish they weren't in there

2174
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,472
Is there such a satisfying art

2175
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,008
To Alex's blow Hardy

2176
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,056
I'm the victim and I'm always right

2177
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,592
To the end of the episode where

2178
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,128
Completely misrepresent

2179
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,152
2 stories

2180
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,176
I'm saying they're can

2181
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,712
So

2182
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,736
Alex is just bad

2183
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,504
You got it.

2184
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,600
Fila website

2185
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,904
About that

2186
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
Story that

2187
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,536
Reminder

2188
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
So much

2189
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,376
I bet no living blackbird

2190
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,656
Has ever had

2191
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,008
Has ever been

2192
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:59,200
No living black person has had as much racism applies as I have it a white person

2193
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,480
Same like

2194
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
Idea of

2195
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:02,784
I got it

2196
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:03,808
This is this

2197
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:04,576
Proves

2198
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
Everything that I

2199
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:08,672
I've ever thought about how I am validated

2200
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,488
That's why he wants

2201
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,256
To talk about

2202
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,656
Caribou

2203
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:24,544
But like the other thing that I need to make clear I don't know if I did a good enough job of it I read a bunch of interviews

2204
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,592
That cuz I wanted

2205
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Text ordered under

2206
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,384
And like

2207
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,664
What else

2208
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,736
Crime with a big part of her

2209
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,504
Career

2210
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,064
It's like she talks about how afterwards she

2211
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:39,392
Like really valued things differently

2212
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,672
Like that

2213
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,208
In every interview that I

2214
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
Confined with her

2215
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:45,024
She doesn't talk about it being like

2216
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:45,792
Some sort of

2217
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,816
Government hit

2218
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,120
She doesn't talk about the being next

2219
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:51,424
Second gang Bangerz or anything like that

2220
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,752
Details that come from this interview

2221
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,568
Extrapolated by ronpaulforums

2222
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,360
Storm fried all of these other play

2223
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,664
That's not something that she talks

2224
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,712
What about in interviews

2225
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,040
With music public aid is there any other

2226
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:08,832
So I don't

2227
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,392
I don't think that she is on the

2228
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,184
It doesn't seem that way

2229
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
It seems like

2230
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
For putting that there

2231
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,256
For her

2232
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:18,816
Cuz I don't

2233
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,216
Venn diagram of all the

2234
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,752
They love it that

2235
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,056
They're coming for our women

2236
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,848
They're their animals

2237
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,408
I don't even want it

2238
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,688
I would make sense

2239
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,480
Play Stoler money but they didn't

2240
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:39,296
Like all of that stuff just all come

2241
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
Comes together to me

2242
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:42,368
Perfect Storm of white guys

2243
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
Justified

2244
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,416
Committed

2245
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:46,464
And meanwhile

2246
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:53,120
A about they're coming for a women while they repeatedly tell her how hot she is

2247
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:55,424
That's not really relevant there

2248
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,728
Navigate to same time

2249
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,008
Perception of

2250
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,568
Today or animals

2251
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:04,640
I'm a vicious animal

2252
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,736
So I don't know

2253
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:20,512
We are on social media

2254
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,280
Plural

2255
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,584
The chirp

2256
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,864
We're on Facebook

2257
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:27,680
