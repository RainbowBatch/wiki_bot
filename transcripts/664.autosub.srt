1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody was a little bit of

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,912
Alex Jones

6
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Vibrates what today is a continuation of the last bright spot metal

7
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Mustard

8
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,272
But I do appreciate it

9
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
I also someone tweeted at us a picture of hot Dan the mustard man

10
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
I hope you had a good man and I want to feel like I have to follow you to some sort of hidden pathway if you're hot

11
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Mustard man you're going to have to choose your own condiment to celebrate a year of

12
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,056
There any condiments that you would choose to

13
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
Take like a sample varieties of her ear like a brother not enough ketchup's

14
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,320
Here's what I would say salad dressing

15
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,672
Spicy spicy Asian sauces

16
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
Okay like a sweet and sour kind of sauce combined with like

17
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Hotel that has a category

18
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
The problem

19
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:36,672
Sub buster

20
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
I definitely do a buzzard

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
My bright spot is somebody

22
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Very kindly they they didn't leave their name on the Note but they very kindly sent me some black

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
Bean coffee and chocolate chocolate

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
Fantastic

25
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
We've established coffee I just drink so much of it that I might as well survive cheaply alright

26
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Drink a pot of coffee a day and Starbucks catch up to you also Folgers sucks

27
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,048
You drink a pot of it a day and you'll get used to it

28
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,168
Chocolate was really good though thank you very much for the wedding present

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
I only have one thing to say which is

30
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,384
But I appreciate it sure I wish I had that on hand

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
Did Emperor also that I made it rolled downhill and I got the

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
We have a very holiday people be very excited

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
To learn that today we have

34
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
Two depositions come over another full episode for y'all

35
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
I think we should not kill anymore

36
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
What that mean

37
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,344
I think we do think that's that's that's called for

38
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Or something

39
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
You're not about to walk

40
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815

Polar besties

44
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
Correction

45
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
Paul and Brett are besties may not be as intuitive

46
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,815
News on the other side of this but

47
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,143
Hello my name is Eric and I tried to get the

Miami star

51
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,199
A list for me

52
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
And then we're going to come back

53
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,695
And I'm going to start the show over

54
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
F*** you

55
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

56
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
F*** you and your new world order

57
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
And f*** the horse you rode in on

58
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
All your s***

59
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Maybe the next few moments broadcast

60
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

61
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

62
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
And you never see me again

63
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
That's really what I want to do

64
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
I never want to come back here again

65
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,599
I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

66
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

67
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
I'll be better tomorrow

68
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
We will not know if he's better yet because today we will be hearing nothing from Alex

69
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,447
Alex info but the news is I've decided what that

70
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
I will be a benevolent podcaster and Eric is asking for Daddy shark to come back

71
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Of course I will

72
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
I will honor this

73
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,527
On the 666

74
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Alex is coming back

75
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,487
Everything we do is so arbitrary

76
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
Preparing this

77
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,399
Podcast is a brutal and ever that it wasn't fun a lot of time

78
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
Until I must amuse myself years of mustard

79
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
So that's that

80
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
Talking about one with kit Daniel who is a editor and writer for Infowars website

81
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,231
Personality although in some videos

82
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
Yeah in the past but not regularly

83
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
That is an issue that is tomorrow to this

84
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
Is a deposition that is related to the Marcel Fontaine case which is a case where

85
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Kate Daniels

86
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,503
I wrote an article and post it on Infowars where he misidentified the Parkland shooter

87
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
Based on a picture that he found on 4chan

88
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,183
And this is delved into position

89
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,791
I'm in the second deposition is Owen Shroyer is deposition in the Sandy Hook case

90
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,399
In Texas

91
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
These are depositions that Mark Paxton didn't know he wasn't it was not a lawyer who

92
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Who was giving these naturally

93
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,943
Hey who was it well it's Bill Ogden hands up his Cove attorney

94
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
For the plaintiff

00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
You know

00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:56,159
Pasta episodes

97
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
About

98
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,583
Or pattern to talk to the attorney who's holding the deposition

99
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,983
They want to talk to us it's very bizarre has got to run out that's been like there's no way that bill

Thanks for having me guys

122

Opening arguments might have a

123
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
Point though it Matt is that we screwed up by putting our podcast in the comedy and news sections at iTune 100

124
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,975
Should have chosen something else that we could be like at the top where the number one law

125
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,607
Wandering wandering vagabond

126
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
John Reza podcast

127
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
Most versatile we are not the best point

128
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
Guard not the best

129
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,639
Center but we're an all-around

130
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
Sixth Man of the Year or bam adebayo that's how we do it here shrimp

00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
My only reference talk to you a little bit

133
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
Before we get to this episode cuz we're listening to to deposition

134
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
That you actually

135
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,679
We're in charge of and we're handling and then

136
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
What would it I'm presenting

137
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,687
Pretty much as an interrogation by the lawyer will take a deposition

138
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Did you ever

139
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
You took a

140
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,439
I did I did

141
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
Behind my friend I was thinking about this

142
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
I went to Austin I met you a mark

143
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679

00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703

Both of those Mark was take

147
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
And I saw his

148
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Style

149
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,431
Kind of like a boar like a jocular kind of

150
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,527
Style there's a little bit of a friendship thing and some playing around

151
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
Watch these depositions that I realize like I would be

152
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
So much more scared

153
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Albion cross the table

154
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
But absolutely but he will make you like it

155
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Well he does

156
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,543
Either questions that you asked like it and knowing that I just see like

157
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,407
Definitely

158
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
In these cases I've told

159
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Especially ones that

160
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Or if we have

161
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
Eyewitness code A1 and I'm I'm taking I'm doing okay

162
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Day-to-day

163
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
I'll tell the witness like

164
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
I'm just letting you know now

165
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Mr. Bankston

Wasn't very pleasant yesterday and he's the nice one

167
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
Straight up with Helen

168
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,567
Training day style Denzel Washington

169
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
You know I didn't pay

170
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
It's coming just

171
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
If you got to do something you might want to hydrate

172
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Do we have

173
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087

Did things kind of

177
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Weird about this is Weezer from

178
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Different case

179
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Owens case

180
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375

It deposition was

182
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423

I swear he went on air and said what he said about Neil sign in

184
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Indeed.com

185
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Mnk

186
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
What's the

187
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
Person at Infowars that wrote the article that started all of this

188
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
He wrote the article about Marcel

189
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Fontaine

190
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
Bridgewater Massachusetts

191
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,719
They pinned his photo and said this is the $4 parking Heist

192
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Shooter

193
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
Just massacred

194
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
So that case

195
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
For the case was filed first in from

196
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
The media attention that we have no idea

197
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
It's coming

198
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
From all of that we got contacted by this

199
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
The chronological order of how this all came

200
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,039
That is that is kind of remarkable I can't imagine being kit Daniels

201
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,623
NM like recognizing exactly what

202
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,023
A dumb f****** you made this down all of it for

203
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
He's very

204
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Critical at least

205
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
Answer my question very critical of himself

206
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
This point I was like yeah

207
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
Greeley

208
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
Some would say it was a bit unprofessional

209
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
But you said to I just

210
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
What's a 1

211
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
This is bad

212
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Call minhwan would be like

213
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:56,607
Broken sentences and skeleton on fire as you write them

214
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
Actually used white van

215
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
On a white background Teresa to play piece of paper I guess would be a one for him

216
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
That's not good that's not going to trigger a Litany of

217
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Litigation against his comfort

218
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
But hey I guess that's

219
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
Better than this

220
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,671
That's so wild though to think about like this just kind of domino effect you had to like

221
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
Get Daniels wrote this article and that led to Marcel Fontaine being defamed and

222
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,935
Starting this trial you guys representing Sandy Hook folks

223
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
But even like the further back

224
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,103
Because the of the Fontaine stuff was based on him reporting on like

225
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Troll s*** from 4chan

226
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,271
So whoever posted that actually is responsible for taking down that way

227
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,111
You can't you can't just go back you got to go keep going forward because

228
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,183
Then it triggered these lawsuits and here I am talking to you

229
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,839
So here I am congratulating Jordan I believe you just got married

230
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Yes I did

231
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Regions Bank hit Daniels

232
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
Congratulations if it wasn't for

233
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
This all makes sense now

234
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,967
What's the problem with us just watching knowing

235
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,831
Yeah this is getting

236
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:25,439
The only the only way this could be better is if it was kit Daniels first day

237
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,559
That would be the greatest moment like the very first thing he wrote

238
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
On his first day was this

239
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,447
Yeah that be beautiful importantly made many errors prior

240
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,311
What are the things that kind of shook me a little bit was when I was watching that deposition

241
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Daniel seems a little bit older than I

242
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,479
I kind of yesterday I think he's 37

243
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Which I was kind of caught up

244
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,903
Wait wait on 32nd

245
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
But you also

246
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
34 years

247
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
I have

248
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Really f***** up my life

249
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,335
Both work backwards I'm better than

250
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Sure I wasn't in that.

251
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:22,015
Keeping score here but I don't think I don't think it's closed

252
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
I'd always pictured him as kind of like a

253
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Maybe mid-to-late twenties guy

254
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Cuz he

255
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
It has like a sort of a youthful

256
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,583
Naivete to him in the times that I've seen him on video on Infowars before

257
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
But I'm seeing him in that room there was a

258
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
You know obviously longer face

259
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
And I've been

260
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Certainly

261
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:50,175
Not having fun baby that ages feel that way probably I will say this you can be a certain person

262
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,015
Life or in your professional career and whatnot but

263
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
When you're walking the deposition

264
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
You asked where where do I sit

265
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,023
It kind of takes a right-hand it's like oh my God

266
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
What am I doing

267
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Everybody else

268
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Cuz there's not your

269
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Looking right at a giant

270
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Directly on you

271
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
And you got lawyers to Spitfire in question

272
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Objection you don't know what's going on but you know you

273
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Don't want to answer that really hard

274
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Right

275
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
And like you have

276
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
Lawyers who probably poorly

277
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,439
Prepared you certainly number of

278
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
Lawyers probably didn't tell people exactly like

279
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,375
Here's what it means to be on the road

280
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,239
Corporate representative does that actually leads us to another

281
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
This is very important

282
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
And that is that

283
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
Ubill where the person

284
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Who took

285
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
Rob dues legendary Depp

286
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
So

287
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
My rollator

288
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Confirm

289
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
When I came in I started looking yet

290
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
And

291
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
When I can't will actually I work there for a year-and-a-half

292
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
During lost

293
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
I started looking around to see

294
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
What can I master

295
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
That can bring value to

296
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,215
The Firm instruction dorks

297
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
Yes that's actually what I do it so 30 B6

298
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
What we call it

299
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
Until I just kind of Master

300
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
Meticulously going through topics and making

301
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
Person just look

302
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
Really unprepared

303
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
In with these topics it was

304
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Hard because

305
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
There's just no way

306
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
There's so many false

307
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Claims in

308
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
Bulshit being thrown around

309
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
That no one could know

310
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Get a grip

311
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:51,263
Like sincerely answering a lot of those questions would just kind of reveal more questions of the

312
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
The Neptune unpreparedness

313
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Probably

314
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
Oh yeah answering them it's worse than not

315
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
At this point just and if they knew the answer

316
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,807
That would be worse than not being prepared to be extension.

317
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
Looks banging Chester whatever it is

318
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,487
I learned one thing

319
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,327
Bobby forward

320
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,495
What kind of what kind of preparation did you or I suppose I mean I assume that this type of

321
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,311
Deposition is a little bit different from the ones that maybe your

322
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
Used to in a regular non Infowars setting

323
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
Did you do like more preparation for this or

324
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,807
Oh I'm pretty prepared on every case that for this one

325
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Specifically

326
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
When

327
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,903
When Mark came into the case he came to me because

328
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
I've been watching

329
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
And not as necessarily is a fan Morris

330
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Entertainment

331
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
It's alright he and I had conversation

332
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,679
Yo in the past about it he's okay you want to

333
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
You want to do this with you

334
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
No questions asked

335
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,151
And so my first job I made partner I think

336
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
During this case

337
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
2 years ago

338
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,759
My first task

339
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
Here's two hundred hours worth of video

340
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
I need you to watch it and

341
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,695
Document everything that goes on

342
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
It's too late

343
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
Actually going through it and

344
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
Two or three or four Days Inn

345
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
And

346
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Mark him in my office and he was like

347
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
What are you looking at and I was like hey

348
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
What disculpa Tonkin

349
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
Because it the way it happened

350
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
Firing so much information from so many directions

351
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,927
It really did, start mess with my head I haven't stopped yet take a step away

352
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,511
I took like two days off and I went back into

353
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,911
Give me to take a couple days off while back

354
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
I gave you my son

355
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Yeah it was definitely

356
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Experience and marcasite

357
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,639
Discontinued

358
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
You've been pranked

359
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
It really is like the

360
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Stylistics

361
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,783
Approach that they use agile

362
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Different

363
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Topix completely that aren't related

364
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
They're just getting thrown in your face

365
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Like you know

366
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
Somebody tossing a bucket of hot dogs into a

367
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,816
In your face I'll just hitting a different areas

368
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
You can't

369
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
The digestive

370
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Awesome so instead you just

371
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Kind of cheap

372
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,520
Yeah specially if it's like the topic is something scary

373
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,848
The kind of overrides your ability to keep track of like

374
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
08 you just jumped from 80 to H what is going on here and then dates back to be in an hour

375
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
What's going on

376
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
So I did all that I got

377
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
From there

378
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
I had a pretty good grasp on

379
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
Mark

380
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
Is

381
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
Just so we're clear marks

382
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
Hundred percent the smart

383
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,192
The brain

384
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
I guess I

385
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,008
Default to the looks but you know Mike

386
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
7online

387
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Dixon, California

388
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,968
The aggressive one and

389
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
I don't like taking zoomed in

390
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
Winter like covid made does the thing

391
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
A defense attorney

392
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
Defense attorney asked me one time

393
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
Why don't you like Takis

394
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Because I've never lied to you

395
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
And he just looked at me like

396
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,264
I'm not saying anything else I'm just saying

397
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
Yeah I'm definitely

398
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:44,480
The bully of the group I guess like when somebody needs to know what a bully needs to get

399
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
Humbled I guess I'm the person that

400
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,928
And takes care of that Mark Martin do it and he doesn't in a in a very articulate way

401
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,768
And he's smart enough to maneuver you into it you don't even know you're hurting you

402
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Say your answer

403
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
Where I'm just asking it in a way that

404
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Possible for you to Ann

405
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
Destroyer Destroyer

406
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
Right right

407
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
The Doublemint I'm not the knot

408
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Right exactly

409
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,248
Probably too like that being in the room

410
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
Being in person is supposed over resume like

411
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:25,184
There's so many of those other aspects like what you mentioned of like you're sitting at the head of this table

412
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,512
You have that camera in front of you and other people are in the room

413
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Like I'm a janitor

414
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
Completely different vibe

415
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
It really is there's an intense

416
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
Driving because

417
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,800
You know I have no problem just staring someone down

418
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Contact

419
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
It's awkward Exchange

420
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,224
They know they're like what do I do

421
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Make a noise

422
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
Fill that void

423
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,720
This is describing like the Errol Morris philosophy of like filmmaking

424
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,072
You know to make people stare at a camera eventually they'll say something

425
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Exactly

426
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
Mike

427
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Techniques of kind of

428
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,848
So Westmoreland County Fair started our firm when they were like

429
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
And they were

430
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
Roll the dice they took all the risk

431
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,064
Classic Warriors and so many years

432
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
So many years

433
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
Markwest College

434
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
David at the

435
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,120
It so I came in and I had the benefit of one riding their code

436
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:44,800
I didn't have to sweat a line of credit it whether or not I can pay him for you but they did all the hard work

437
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
Until I got the benefit of learning under them in

438
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
I just

439
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Cook

440
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,736
Certain aspects from each of the lawyers

441
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
Could

442
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Stylistics

443
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,048
Which of which of those other partners

444
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Taught you about snack

445
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Preparation

446
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
So

447
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,520
That's actually Westfall not necessarily actually probably been pissed

448
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Deposition

449
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,248
Making making people uncomfortable

450
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
When you're asking

451
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
Uncomfortable questions

452
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
Makes them just wanted to end

453
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
So they give you whatever they they know what you

454
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,768
And if they're uncomfortable they're just going to give it rather than

455
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Playing this line of things

456
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,912
Ask a question again I don't understand what you're asking did that kind of thing

457
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
Stop at Buc-ee's

458
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,616
Famous gas stations cycle Walmart

459
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
Giant bag of

460
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Gummy worm

461
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
It's like during the Depo

462
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,672
Hold it up to the light

463
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
Beat It

464
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
And like I use it as a n

465
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
And then

466
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
There

467
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
Will cannabis gummy bear not down on them

468
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,240
The one thing that was bad with

469
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,128
Southern accent

470
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Set alarm

471
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,200
I actually stole that from

472
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
There's a real famous

473
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Slayer text

474
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Married

475
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
And he would take a paperclip

476
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,928
Wilder the other side was doing their opening statements

477
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,256
And he would slowly make straighten it all the way up

478
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
Innocent back we could smoke indoors

479
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
Cigs inside

480
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
But he would take a straight paper clip and then you would slide it down

481
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
Need the cigarette into light it

482
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
And then he would smoke it in the

483
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,128
The Ashwood

484
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,224
Until the jury would just stare at that instead of paying attention

485
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,880
To the other side's opening statement because they're waiting for this long cigarette Ash to stop and it doesn't

486
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
You know.

487
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
It's kind of cool

488
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,072
To do and so I I kind of bets that's where it started and then I

489
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Incorporated

490
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
I feel like that that cigarette trick

491
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
That's like sleight of hand

492
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
Yeah with people's attention where is like

493
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
The Gummy Bears Just aggressive

494
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Like that

495
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Just like

496
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,456
It's menacing

497
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm so comfortable that I'm going to

498
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,904
Like this is not uncomfortable for me

499
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
It would be very threatening

500
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
I mean it's it's funny

501
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:50,400
Now but if if I was in a room with you while you were doing that God I would just call you a prick non-stop like it wouldn't

502
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
The answer a question I just feel like could you get this brick to stop eating me f****** worm imagine a scenario where you can't do that

503
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:03,200
Well then I'm in trouble right

504
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
Cheney snackin there's 2 things 1

505
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,808
You thinking how disrespectful

506
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
God I wish you'd give me one

507
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
And so either way

508
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
It's not good

509
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,536
I can you ask for a gummy worm or is that against the law I think you're probably be rawsome July

510
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,352
Oh no that would be best case scenario

511
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,168
Because if they ask me for a gummy worm

512
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:29,568
I only brought enough for one knowing it's a message for god sakes just

513
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,128
To let the air out of a b

514
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
I'm always looking for later

515
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
Everybody's most people

516
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
The awkwardness

517
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,784
And I'm there to create it

518
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
Livin it so that when someone gets awkward you learn a lot

519
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
When your meeting you can get a good read on somebody

520
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,352
I try to make people uncomfortable very quickly in a Depo

521
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
In a bad way just

522
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
To put them on their toes

523
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
See how they react so that I can then

524
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
What's my questions into amor

525
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Impact

526
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
You're like what if jigsaw was a lawyer

527
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,456
Exactly what if jigsaw

528
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Didn't

529
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,672
Hey you let you hang yourself to I mean it's the same basic principle

530
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:22,816
And I like the idea of it does start with would you like to play a game

531
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Be

532
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
I've been watching

533
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:33,312
Oh watch me on these lives at this March or this protest and I'm thinking myself

534

He's just

535
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Going and finding

536
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
The best clips

537
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,992
She's got nobody spoken so soon as

538
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Hustling

539
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,320
Did heslin case came in I called dibs on

540
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,136
From 44 years ago

541
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Enmark was like

542
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
10%

543
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
Are roughly the same age

544
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
I want him to

545
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Spiel

546
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
What other people feel like when

547
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
She doesn't

548
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,936
Urge to bully the bully

549
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,520
Yeah exactly exactly like a show you how it's

550
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
When you meet your match here

551
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
And the best part was

552
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
I found a video

553
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
The night before of him at the woman's March

554
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
March in DC and he was wearing Trump Garden

555
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
In a lot of people were

556
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
Saying like oh what it how could you be out here wearing a

557
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,208
Trump scarf

558
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,792
It's important that you support women

559
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
Women that were sexually traffic at the exit Highway

560
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
Wish I was

561
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
I can get by

562
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,264
And then they're like yeah but y'all

563
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
Name one

564
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,480
If Trump is so bad maybe one woman's name as an accuser and these people

565
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
And

566
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
And he's like yeah so you can't even name one name

567
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
So you're not even informed

568
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Until I heard that

569
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,536
Can you name

570
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Do you know the name of

571
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
Do you know can you name one

572
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,520
You can't

573
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,080
Play the clip of him doing it other people

574
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
And at the end

575
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
It was so unnecessary

576
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
You see my question

577
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,528
You're not there and he just looks at me on the record

578
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
I tip my hat to you I'm out

579
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,440
At least you understand

580
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
What was happen

581
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Like he knew

582
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Rail

583
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:34,656
That's awareness inside the room you know like you're being able to to get that place

584
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,520
British excuse me I believe I have been hoisted

585
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
These people that he's talking to in that video that you found

586
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
What if they

587
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,624
Hosted a show where they complained about Trump accusers

588
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
I still couldn't name

589
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
You know that's good

590
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
That's even more sensitive

591
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
What makes your example even more egregious

592
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Yeah so he

593
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,656
I will say this

594
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
I walked into Owens Depo

595
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Thinking he was a bad guy

596
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
And

597
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
I could see in his face the more we talk about what happened and how we got here and how

598
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Drawing all the s*** was that

599
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
He said

600
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
He was having a

601
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Epiphany

602
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Anger

603
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
Not towards us or towards

604
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
Point towards his staff

605
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Company

606
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,328
And at the end when I said you know it's mr. hassling

607
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,192
Or Miss Lewis was in the room right now what would you say and he was remorseful

608
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
He was sorry he was the only one

609
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
He walked out of there

610
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
It's not fair

611
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,456
But I really do appreciate you doing what you did

612
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,784
And I say what he did so he walked away from that

613
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
I get his position

614
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Easter

615
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
What you supposed to do

616
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:09,376
No it make a car wash wood

617
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
I'm not sure

618
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Car wash

619
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
In Liberal Austin Woodhall

620
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:19,616
Or whatever his real first name is it maybe

621
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
I don't know

622
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:25,248
Yeah you can bring your little differently life somewhere in Nebraska

623
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Crepe Place worm

624
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
Omaha nice during like

625
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:36,256
Oh I wouldn't let him in a city he's got to be very quiet by himself small-town Nebraska

626
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,328
He's from my home state of Missouri

627
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
And so like

628
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,008
Some people do I exit Missouri but like what I'm saying

629
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
People from their likes

630
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
That's funny you brought that up

631
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
Why do we call it Germany

632
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,968
When people from Germany called Deutschland

633
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Anybody and everybody

634
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,464
Yeah that's that's actually kind of a bone of contention

635
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
The people in Missouri there's the Missouri people and then

636
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
Missouri.

637
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
It's I mean

638
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,656
You know I mean it is ironic but yes that was

639
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:20,288
Divided over this

640
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
But yeah either way like Owens

641
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,944
He walked out of there he was

642
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Only Witness

643
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
Walk out besides Maybe

644
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,296
That was actually

645
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
And I don't know what they're sorry because

646
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,208
Were they were just that was the first time anybody actually given them all

647
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,560
Cuz there was a lot of stuff most of them had no idea like wait what

648
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,144
Well I just leave more inclined to agree with that about cat

649
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
Watching his deposition

650
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
I do think there's a lot keeping

651
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
Many things that will get into over the course of the episode

652
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
He shockingly doesn't know about

653
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
I want to take nose a bit more

654
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
I have is like

655
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
Yeah he may not have another choice

656
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,320
But if he recognized like it's on record

657
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,368
Sicknesses how bad this stuff is

658
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
But he's involved in

659
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,768
And continues to do it's worse you watch his show now he's doing the same

660
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
Southlake

661
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:20,192
He's just very safe he's just making sure nobody's names and nobody's I'm not identifying groups he's safe

662
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
With what he does in

663
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,056
He is a True Believer to an extent on that but when

664
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
He talked about Sandy

665
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
And it just happened to be the one time

666
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
Within the statue limitation

667
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Brought them in

668
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
He did it I think somebody was just like

669
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
A new kid say that

670
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
Since then he was on a bunch of other

671
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
But

672
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,376
At the time I I don't fault

673
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Best early for that

674
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
And watching a show I did not

675
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
Seems like you'd be more brash

676
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,688
But you did

677
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
In the heat on Aries

678
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
You don't

679
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
Interviews in olives

680
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
Elvis videos

681
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,088
He is very brash

682
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,904
But when he gets into serious moment

683
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
East yummy he's just

684
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,512
Yeah but what you're describing about him

685
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,120
And you wanted to hate him more the end of the the deposition was definitely

686
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,424
How I felt about Paul Joseph Watson

687
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Deposition

688
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
He saw it

689
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
He saw the writing on

690
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
No problem

691
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Stop doing what the

692
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
Walking we doing this is

693
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,760
This is horrible for all of us

694
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,320
It's going to give us this reputation

695
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
And you can see from that email

696
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
He split

697
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
And he starts doing his own thing because he's doesn't you know

698
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
He's not going down with that s***

699
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Well I mean he has his his

700
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Speed in both

701
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Sort of boats as it were you know like

702
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,728
He has his own thing as much as he's doing like his own YouTube channel

703
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,824
I like it's kind of separate but he's also still hosting Infowars sometimes

704
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
And I still very closely connected

705
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Do you still like the

706
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Main editor of the site

707
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,760
And what have you he will I will say this

708
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
He

709
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,344
He does have some sort of moral compass

710
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,624
He knows

711
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
Right and wrong

712
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
Which not weird to say about me

713
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
Adults

714
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,728
Know what I mean but you have to kind of be a psychopath to work at Infowars so it doesn't make sense

715
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,080
Right and wrong would be a rare ability

716
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
It's it's

717
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,944
Funny because you know as much as they're like oh we're not sheep we don't

718
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
Just follow what

719
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Dr. fauci says

720
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,816
When that boy poursuite kit for swinging

721
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Such

722
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
It right now

723
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,680
At work I'm sure

724
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Career-wise

725
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Because he was like

726
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm like why did you

727
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Here he's like

728
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
Alex Jones

729
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,040
Okay and I was like

730
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
And then

731
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
In what you know

732
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,096
If I were called there's a couple times you're like

733
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
Alex is not going to like that answer

734
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
You said it you got to live

735
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
Ynw

736
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
He is not going to like that

737
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
He said something way different

738
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,160
And then you can see their face like

739
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,744
There's something so awful about like being in a room

740
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Being questioned by

741
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Somebody who has like

742
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,864
Start of the freedom or whatever to just like

743
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:05,216
The Trap has been set you have stepped in it and then you were just like

744
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,032
That was a trap

745
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
Yeah cuz I don't like

746
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
I knew that

747
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,712
I'm setting it up they have no idea then they say it and sometimes

748
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
He doesn't even know he's stuck

749
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
Estep's ametis just dangling and I'm right here

750
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
Listen to trap music

751
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
What attracts I'm Amazed

752
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,608
Whenever we watched all these depositions I am just shocked that these people aren't constantly going like

753
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:37,984
Over and over and over again where afterwards they go

754
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,544
But it's just

755
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,944
It's a rape they're stepping on the same rake over and over and over again

756
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Same

757
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Exactly

758
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,528
Exactly

759
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
It's definitely

760
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
1

761
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
Regardless of who the lawyer is

762
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Hostage

763
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,256
Job I don't I don't think

764
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Preppies the problem

765
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,912
Couldn't help some of these Infowars people

766
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
That's it

767
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,824
Definitely a tall order to try and say oh yeah

768
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,640
Full day full day of prep is on

769
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
Robert Barnes

770
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
In their corner

771
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
It doesn't get much better

772
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,416
Yeah heat so I was the

773
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
One that kind of broke

774
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Second

775
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
No the first

776
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
Rob do Depo

777
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
Where he just goes on man

778
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
You know

779
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:51,200
What I'm asking for start unreasonable you just blew is when I knew he had a few

780
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
It's A1C did I look at it

781
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
Always I could medicine

782
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
I'm not even going to comment

783
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
On the reef

784
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
And I just left it there you could

785
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
And I knew that

786
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,216
Attack with like a interview with Stefan molyneux about that

787
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
8

788
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,432
It kind of

789
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Gave Mark and I

790
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,904
He brought us back to our roots and showed us like this is why we do this

791
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
This is this

792
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
We called a hobby case

793
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,328
We brought it on because the money doesn't we don't

794
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
And all sorts of

795
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,472
Civil rights cases

796
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,824
Big industrial accidents in the auto defects we we made money

797
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
So each lawyer brings on a case

798
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
At any given time

799
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,247
That they want to do for the right reasons and that's why we bought this one

800
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
And that's why I give all the credit

801
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
Because they have never told us no

802
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,487
And I've never said you know I didn't watch your spending or anything or just like

803
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
If you guys need help let us know I love you

804
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Subway

805
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
That's when we brought this in

806
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
We start taking the Depo

807
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,055
It wasn't worth it was like we're looking like I'm not trapping

808
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Thoroughly

809
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
Invested in

810
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,407
And being as prepared as I can

811
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,711
Because I just we just wanted to destroy this

812
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,831
Imagine that after you start doing these depositions

813
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
You start to see the level of sort of

814
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,255
You could call it unpreparedness or disrespect that's being shown by

815
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
These

816
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,071
Defendants in like that's got to

817
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
Got2b invigorating

818
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
In some ways or at least free

819
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
It is mainly because it happened

820
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
In all case

821
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,871
Not like this though right

822
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
First of all

823
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,479
We've never everybody always

824
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,807
It's not uncommon to do a motion for sanctions

825
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,855
It's not uncommon to

826
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,415
Seeking default cuz this is so egregious

827
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Until now

828
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
In these cases

829
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,143
These cases have just they literally have kind of

830
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
They kind of screwed me moving

831
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,263
Because no matter I'm not going to be so hard on

832
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
My head

833
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
I'm going to say

834
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Wayward

835
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,015
You're no Barnes so well

836
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,831
You were wrong

837
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
But you're not that

838
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Because

839
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
When I

840
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
First started

841
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:49,119
I had I was the young guy trying to chip on my shoulder and I was just like let's go I'm about to start a bunch of forest fires

842
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,911
Even if it's unnecessary I'm here

843
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Star Wars

844
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
You were 20

845
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
Some of us grow some of us

846
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
And

847
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
And then I got older and I start with

848
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,271
A little bit

849
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
Hey you don't have to be this aggressive

850
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
And all that and then I got to this case

851
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
Here we go

852
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,719
I forgot what this.

853
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,351
Yeah you're not y'all are hungry I was back whenever I was a stand-up

854
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,215
You know if you had a run of really bad shows and you just weren't doing well you just couldn't

855
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
You just kept sucking

856
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,591
There were a couple of rooms that are that were notoriously

857
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
Easy to get really big laughs from

858
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
And that's where you would go to like

859
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,295
Reinvigorate yourself you know that like I yeah I am funny that kind of

860
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:45,695
If I can make it it really does feel like this is where you're at you know like all these real cases

861
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
F*** you hard

862
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,559
You know I got to fight the end this I just get to come in and f******

863
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,631
Beat up on bounce to children

864
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,519
Is suing Alex Jones are being the plaintiff's attorney for Alex Jones is like going to the

865
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:04,639
What's the name of a

866
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Airbag.

867
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
And I did

868
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,271
15 GB

869
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
Document sent over to my office

870
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
There's nothing exciting

871
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,415
Reagan 15 instrumental words on lights

872
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,975
Where do we where do we start

873
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
I really hope there's no child for

874
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,607
Slight

875
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,167
What's child pronography in some of their discovery

876
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,959
Connecticut

877
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
But it was just

878
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
The stuff

879
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,311
Beat the documents they do have

880
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
Are just

881
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
We only get about

882
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
15% of

883
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
The craziness that is

884
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,295
Is given to them or that they send to each other

885
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,367
A lot of stuff doesn't come out until we get to

886
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
Jesus

887
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
Yes

888
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,767
It is fascinating to see how

889
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
The inner workings of something like the

890
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:00,191
Yeah one of the things that really stuck out to me from the two depositions whenever last time was

891
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:05,567
Comprehensive background check on Leonard Posner that was just weirdly

892
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
In their files

893
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:12,991
Like that's okay don't know where it came from it just still fell out of your hair that way

894
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
Yeah that that was real

895
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,135
Dad and them posting

896
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
You know

897
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
But our Network

898
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
PO box that's the stuff that pisses

899
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
That's why we like okay

900
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
I'm not in any way throwing to

901
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
You can pretend to be nice and

902
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,983
I'm sorry that Danny got got it that was the initial

903
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,311
Started getting into it it was just

904
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,151
I'm going to enjoy what I'm

905
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
Nice guy

906
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,551
But it's now when I'm punching the time card on my to be an a******

907
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
Walking to work

908
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,671
Subway

909
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
Break room

910
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
In-N-Out

911
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,839
Mark and I are fully invest in this case

912
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,631
We would sometimes lose

913
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:06,495
Sight of you know because we're so focused on doing what we're doing and worth we are enjoying

914
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,383
Sit down together for a meeting and talk about what we're doing next

915
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,687
Realized

916
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Going to be a very emotional

917
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
Trial and it's going to be a very

918
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,415
You know there's not

919
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,767
And so we have not invited

920
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
Right yeah because you

921
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
There will be

922
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
It is and

923
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,823
Enso

924
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,383
The client

925
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,199
They are some of the bravest people I've ever met

926
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:52,319
And and Mark Marcus extremely Closer Closer with all of them

927
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,647
I started off as kind of the Workhorse that was behind the sea

928
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
She's doing all the stuff

929
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,951
Watch out garbage

930
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
Videos

931
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,791
And it's so many it's so many more than you

932
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,863
When I say 2:00 video

933
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
It's 2:00

934
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
What should be 1,000

935
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
Because everything so scattered out and

936
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,615
At least like a third of it is commercials

937
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,455
Commercials

938
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,831
Elizabeth Williamson is a writer to your timezone

939
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,183
She contact us and that I wanted can I fly down and just follow y'all around 4

940
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,279
Sure yeah New York Times you can do that

941
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
What we didn't say what we didn't notice we have zero media

942
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,703
Enso step one was like let's go to El Tiempo

943
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
That's where

944
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,335
And I don't know if you actually

945
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
Strong margarita

946
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,735
Reporter

947
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,807
All the stuff you're not supposed to say to the media

948
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
I realized it about it

949
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:58,879
Our end

950
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
And I'm like

951
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,255
If this is going to turn into a hit piece I just want you to know

952
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,327
You have full authority to lie and embellished

953
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
If it's going to be bad

954
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,799
I just want you to know cuz I realized a lot of stuff

955
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:23,199
No one said off-the-record at all guys and like everyone

956
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
You guys are fine

957
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
But she

958
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,087
Bartender should really

959
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Do that for you

960
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
Like to say this is off the Record

961
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:38,303
Yeah there's everyone's a bartender should have like a a journalist credential that they have to check and then

962
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,143
Do the whole thing I like it I'm going to open a bar call author

963
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:48,543
But she she just published a book a couple weeks ago

964
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:54,687
And in that She interviewed me, right when I was really digging into the video

965
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:00,831
And I should say what are you getting out of it not just watched when I was like honestly I'm really I'm really into these

966
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Combat wipes

967
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,415
Delta commercial Medical Center

968
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
What are they going outside

969
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,327
I mean if you break it down it's just baby wipes for bunch of middle-aged

970
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,423
Caucasian men better camping out in the woods with some friends calling themselves

971
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,823
If she put it in the book

972
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,895
Niacin

973
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,991
So fresh down there when you're with all your militia

974
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,343
With the intro of

975
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,927
1

976
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
Rest my life

977
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,023
I could have been more professional in

978
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:47,679
With that watching all those videos and having that like

979
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,471
You said you watched Alex

980
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,007
From when you were like in college

981
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
We going to look at entertainment 911 JF

982
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Hey

983
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
You know

984
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,943
Human hybrid amphibians

985
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,967
You're real

986
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
It was

987
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
Everywhere

988
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,575
My Generation go

989
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,647
Facebook came to my college my freshman year

990
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,207
Eating you

991
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,791
Email address to have Facebook

992
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,375
W w Facebook I will never forget we are

993
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
I promised we would never forget that

994
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
And so

995
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:26,591
Technological era of news and information and all that was

996
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,895
As I was coming of age and so

997
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Alex Jones I would see differ

998
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,039
Articles

999
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
Washington

1000
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,903
Exactly

1001
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,975
And I bet it was entertainment and then

1002
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,279
Closer to closer we got to 2000

1003
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Election

1004
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,631
Is when he decide Sandy Hook

1005
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,423
He took an extreme

1006
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,983
Story probably the most egregious extreme story

1007
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
Mylifetime

1008
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
And then he made it even more

1009
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Brighton

1010
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,895
From there the clothes we got

1011
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,431
2016 he realized

1012
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
Takikos political Heat

1013
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
And he did

1014
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,807
The heat went when he went right

1015
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
Kids luggage

1016
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,367
And

1017
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
I mean for instance I keep

1018
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
I mean

1019
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
I what I said wasn't

1020
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:25,215
Right

1021
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:31,615
Rap.

1022
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,919
I'll have one of those

1023
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
Yeah

1024
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,111
Political before it was just that he loved Ron Paul who is never going to win

1025
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
The doctor

1026
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,743
Yeah he's the most notorious OBGYN on the planet

1027
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,095
And the only OBGYN I think who tried to take over an island nation

1028
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,495
Everybody has their version of events right

1029
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,847
He was use libertarian in heat I mean

1030
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,383
He was not a fan of George Bush

1031
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,479
Senior or Junior

1032
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,295
Which is funny because

1033
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:15,135
George Bush became Governor by saying yes that person over there

1034
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,671
Conservative I'm bored

1035
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
In-N-Outs Jones

1036
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,423
Exploded

1037
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
Did I experience like

1038
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Really

1039
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:36,639
Feel different though like watching it and paying attention versus watching it for entertainment

1040
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:41,247
Like the content because you cuz I'm not watching

1041
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
I'm not really watching

1042
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
The continent as much as

1043
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,087
I'm breaking down

1044
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
The stylist

1045
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:51,743
The style of how he's doing it how he's going into these in and planning them and how he

1046
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,791
Transition you notice all that now

1047
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,583
And you realize it's

1048
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
It was a way

1049
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,775
That no one had really match

1050
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
Astrid until

1051
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:05,823
2

1052
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:12,735
Rapid fire things that someone where you can ask question because there's so much coming at you and there's so many

1053
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
Questions to ask

1054
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,039
You just don't have time

1055
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:19,391
Or you forget about something that he said 5 minutes ago because you're now talking about some

1056
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
Yeah there's a there's a craft

1057
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,255
To it that I'm not even positive

1058
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,303
Entirely conscious of what he

1059
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
He's doing

1060
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
But it is

1061
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,679
There is something today really just kind of a debate text

1062
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,495
Take like overwhelming the person that you're talking to with like

1063
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,055
Too much stopping and hoping they get flustered

1064
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,639
But yeah

1065
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,967
Open till like

1066
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,783
Sandy Hook an avid listener

1067
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,831
I'm his and

1068
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,879
Then this happened

1069
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,927
Yeah well if you say not too much

1070
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,767
It's got its got to make you re-evaluate whether or not

1071
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,839
Good idea to believe Alex about to Oklahoma City

1072
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,631
And stuff like that

1073
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:06,751
You're on the wrong address

1074
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
Kent and Owen like

1075
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,615
Tell me one story

1076
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,407
But y'all gotten right

1077
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,735
Yeah

1078
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,063
Okay anything in the last 20 years

1079
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:28,767
Owen was on the ground at the Gulf of negative

1080
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,047
8 years old

1081
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,887
I will say this they did they they called Epstein early

1082
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Well

1083
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
The globalist for sex traffic

1084
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
But they are called jussie Smollett

1085
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:56,159
Boris if you're just a racist all

1086
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
All the time

1087
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
Then yes

1088
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
You're going to call Jessie Smollett

1089
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,279
But that's

1090
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:12,287
The way I like to say it is even in a pitch-black room

1091
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
And you're throwing darts

1092
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,615
Hit the target

1093
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,199
This literally what they do is they just

1094
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,479
Everything's okay

1095
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,503
Conspiracy

1096
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,319
Everything Is Not What It Seems until one time

1097
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
And you know

1098
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:30,463
I'll give you that however they got their those were things that they

1099
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,351
Didn't totally end up with something it was wrong and eyesight

1100
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:43,007
That's the bar

1101
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
Public figure

1102
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,831
Yeah that's with a kit Daniels when it just like name something

1103
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,623
You didn't get Ross

1104
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
Emily just like

1105
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,951
Ava keeps going

1106
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
Painful

1107
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,815
The first time it happened Rob do is doing

1108
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,911
Name one and he just sitting there and I was like

1109
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,703
This is getting

1110
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,967
Well I don't want to say under oath something we got right just in case

1111
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Underoath

1112
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Bear hole

1113
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
Motto

1114
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,183
And floss music

1115
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,767
You know if we

1116
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,327
We got stories

1117
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Please don't make me

1118
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:49,823
Will Alex just the other day was saying that once it gets to the trial for the Sandy Hook case

1119
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:55,455
He's going to reveal and expose how all the people are making money on Sandy Hook

1120
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:00,831
And all this

1121
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,879
So I'm excited for a number

1122
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,207
First of all when we went

1123
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
Media

1124
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,511
Started

1125
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:13,375
Immediately on the show with Hillary Clinton and George Soros

1126
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:17,215
And the data that was said we were all at lunch

1127
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
I looked at my

1128
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,031
My phone and I saw somebody

1129
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,615
And I was like this and I looked at the table

1130
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,455
Which one of you f****** has all the money missing Sharon

1131
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,783
Where's the Soros check cuz I haven't

1132
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:36,159
Everyone's phones on the table who has a text from Hilary Foods

1133
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
Who's holding out

1134
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
It's also fun

1135
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Hearing with us

1136
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,863
And heister

1137
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Something

1138
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
Play by the defense

1139
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,703
Soros

1140
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,543
Accusation a pronoun

1141
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,615
I just want you I just want for the record

1142
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,455
Just want everyone to know

1143
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:06,367
I picked up so I don't want anyone getting credit

1144
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
Except me I am

1145
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,719
Any power behind us

1146
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,815
Well I'm glad I'm glad we're able to clear up lien on Soros

1147
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
Connection

1148
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:21,727
Unless unless marks keistering a bunch of checks that he hadn't told anybody about it we have not received

1149
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,287
We did start receiving money

1150
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,591
And cards of support at the

1151
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,895
Beginning and everyone so I will still get one

1152
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,967
And people just started sending cash in and stuff

1153
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,063
To us sahay this treatment help with the legal car

1154
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
And

1155
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,671
Barking Lot

1156
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,463
Donated

1157
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,327
Dioner Network he's like oh that's perfect

1158
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,887
Anytime somebody to email

1159
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:58,335
To the two people that reached out to her email or call him

1160
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,359
Appreciate it

1161
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,223
What just if you want to donate donate to the honor Network cuz they

1162
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Their Network at Target

1163
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,063
Internet misinformation

1164
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,671
Probably makes you look more like you're taking Soros money

1165
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:18,047
Bright hey I will do anything in my power to look more suspicious

1166
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:26,239
All right when we come out when your Optics are giving money away clearly that means that Soros is gay

1167
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:30,591
Giving you that money to give away obviously otherwise you wouldn't be able to give that money away

1168
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,407
Makes me want to buy one of those little earpieces

1169
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:38,783
The little of stretchy cord that like the secret service where I want to look at him and then

1170
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,575
Start talking into my cough

1171
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,231
It'd be great if in a deposition you had an earpiece

1172
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
But it was connected to a gummy worm

1173
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
Right right

1174
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,911
And a lit cigarette

1175
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,079
Everybody's looking at me like hey that's illegal now

1176
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
Is this lawyer crazy

1177
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:12,319
Also we should probably wrap this up before too long I think we're about an hour or so weak but

1178
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:16,159
There's anything else that you wanted to cover about the deposition

1179
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
Anyting

1180
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,719
But like would be a good

1181
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,999
Introductory note

1182
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,815
Cuz we're going to get into it after her after we talked

1183
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:27,167
Sure so I would say with the Owen.

1184
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,983
I Walked Outta.

1185
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
Thinking that was

1186
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
Way better than

1187
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
Berry II

1188
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,919
Kenu

1189
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,479
The position he was in and he was

1190
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
One of the few that didn't even

1191
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,855
At one point, through all the papers the answer

1192
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
Make this

1193
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
2

1194
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
Only makes more money than

1195
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,815
Yeah

1196
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,399
Their payroll is out of control based on the depositions that I've heard

1197
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,447
Yeah so

1198
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,727
And then

1199
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,055
Early on I realized

1200
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,103
I'm not dealing with the top

1201
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
Pizza

1202
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
Key

1203
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:15,295
But he is a he's the type of person that

1204
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,087
Doesn't know

1205
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
Then to Bolivar

1206
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,695
And so

1207
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
I use that again

1208
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,767
And I would

1209
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,047
He would say a

1210
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,631
What is that mean

1211
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,703
And then he'd give me the definition of

1212
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Okay

1213
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
What's now apply that

1214
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,847
That was probably the highlight

1215
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,895
It's when I said Owen

1216
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,943
Is Infowars mean

1217
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,295
Absolutely not okay what is mainstream media

1218
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
You know they have

1219
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,135
Been around for a little while have a reputation

1220
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
Bay

1221
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:56,511
Have corporate advertising

1222
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,559
Alright what about bright

1223
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
He's like no I wouldn't

1224
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,191
And then I realized as soon as I say that

1225
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,263
Before they were bi platform

1226
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
All of these things

1227
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Tobacconist

1228
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
He's like

1229
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,015
What about this

1230
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,855
I bet that's not just the whole listing of my okay with what's up with us

1231
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:35,167
Chris Brown

1232
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Ben

1233
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
At one point

1234
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,983
I got him

1235
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,031
I asked one

1236
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Let's just agree

1237
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,591
You don't even know

1238
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
Yeah.

1239
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:53,087
Best case scenario for Myanmar sitting there

1240
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
When I'm going out

1241
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
Making sure that run

1242
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:02,303
After Time by the time one of us gets done with the note in hands

1243
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
Question

1244
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,375
We've already verbatim said

1245
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
We can read each other's mind so big we be doing this

1246
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
And

1247
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Enso

1248
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:16,127
Mark starts writing and then when she comes out.

1249
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:22,527
He just kind of has a short job

1250
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,063
I don't know

1251
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,087
A Marxist

1252
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,487
It was loud enough to where everyone in the room

1253
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
But he didn't get caught on the wreck

1254
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,119
There's one other time that that if you listen closely you can

1255
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
And

1256
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:43,007
It's during on cell phone I was like yeah I was live on here

1257
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,311
Somebody who I don't remember

1258
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,895
Handed me these documents that we already got the clips ready to go run

1259
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
And

1260
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,991
And I'm like so you just

1261
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
Hope it is

1262
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,903
Somebody who conveys a message but someone else has control

1263
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,463
Your live on here

1264
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,535
Somebody can't do story you don't know what

1265
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
They have control

1266
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Right

1267
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,911
And then you can bathe

1268
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
Exactly

1269
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
So you're a puppy

1270
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
Yeah

1271
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:19,359
I am a puppet

1272
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
But

1273
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,271
Marcos

1274
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,063
Ron Burgundy

1275
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
You can hear it

1276
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,535
I

1277
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,327
Rock all these Depots regardless

1278
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,655
Questioning the other person is literally they're just being popped

1279
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,703
Watching in Triangle today

1280
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
But

1281
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,591
But yeah that's

1282
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
Ron Burgundy

1283
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,919
And he wasn't trying to be

1284
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,967
Disruptive or anything you just had come to him

1285
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,295
He said it very quietly in my ear

1286
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
I just look at it

1287
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:05,695
That's a little loud buddy

1288
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,447
Does no mainstream media is

1289
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
And I'm a puppet

1290
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,775
And Daniel's price

1291
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,359
And rightly so

1292
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,895
So that's

1293
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:30,527
Hard to argue with that

1294
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,087
How's the baby

1295
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
That's the brief

1296
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:40,767
We'll get into a couple hours breakdown of the sea

1297
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,839
Or whatever

1298
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,911
Oh Bill thank you so much for joining us

1299
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:52,031
As a policy wonk I was honored to be asked to appear on the show

1300
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,823
And I love what you guys do

1301
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,663
Let means a lot and it was it was great to meet you down in Austin I hope

1302
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:01,247
I'm a I'm a make the trip before the trial soaps

1303
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
To see you again next month

1304
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,807
Absolutely

1305
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
Take care guys

1306
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,903
And congratulations on the

1307
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,511
Congratulations

1308
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:28,383
Take in

1309
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
Along

1310
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:34,527
Listening to idiots

1311
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,927
That's the plan so I decided that we're going to start with the kit Daniels deposition cuz I think

1312
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:47,839
I think we can all agree that if this is the lineup of 2012 headliner

1313
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
But it's just the reality

1314
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:55,775
Position of February 17th of this year

1315
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:00,127
Do with the Parkland shooter misidentification they put in an Infowars article

1316
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:04,735
Shooter as Marcel Fontaine who is now suing

1317
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:11,135
Probably more famous of a figure in that the Sandy Hook litigation is probably more price

1318
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,415
Primary in people's minds

1319
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:18,303
My position is probably more revealing than many of the other Zoe's cover

1320
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:23,935
Maybe not more than Daria but it's up there and most of what we revealed through dark areas was the cheese

1321
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:30,591
I'm weird out psycho music during his deposition is it was

1322
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:39,551
Nature comes from I'm sorry to say

1323
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
Seems really dumb

1324
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:47,231
But that sounds harsh now but I sure you as we go through this that assessment I think is going to seem very fair

1325
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:53,887
He doesn't seem to know or understand much and because of that he ends up getting himself into really bizarre places well

1326
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
I'll being questioned under oath

1327
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:00,287
Sometimes this dumbness intersects with the level of naivete in those places

1328
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:05,663
Doesn't seem like he realizes some of the stuff he's revealing about the inner workings of Infowars which is

1329
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
Wild

1330
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:13,087
A lot of that stuff may not be legally problematic but it's definitely damning in the context of our show and what we cover

1331
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:19,743
There's another aspect of this too and it's something that bill kind of touchdown Which is that you kind of want to end up

1332
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,791
Liking kit a little bit

1333
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:27,679
He doesn't seem like such a bad guy a lot of the time and it's clear lack of understanding about basic concept

1334
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,495
It triggers a certain amount of pity in the viewer

1335
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,775
The Listener

1336
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:38,175
Those feelings are fairly complicated and waited along with a clear awareness that he's been employed Infowars for like

1337
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,735
He doesn't deserve the benefit of any doubts

1338
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:47,391
It really makes a bizarre mix of of of an experience

1339
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
Definitely

1340
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:54,815
Something that I found more interesting than I expected it to be for someone who is essentially

1341
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,119
Boo Radley if you will

1342
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:00,703
He's not a franchise he's a role player

1343
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,751
I get what you mean

1344
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:07,615
Easy you feel complicated things about Boo Radley

1345
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:14,271
I think there's a lot to a lot to dig here so let's let's just Jump Right In

1346
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:20,927
And we learn write the beginning a lot of preliminary conversation and I need deposition

1347
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,255
Talking about past employment how long have you worked today

1348
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:28,863
I'm working to jump in where we learn about Kate Daniels salary okay

1349
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
From

1350
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
May of 2030

1351
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,543
14 to the summer 2018

1352
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,567
Associate editor

1353
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,383
Broccoli

1354
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
And then after that

1355
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
Promoted

1356
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Something like that

1357
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
When you say something

1358
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,367
We don't really have

1359
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,927
A culture at Infowars of

1360
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,207
Job title

1361
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
What is the culture in 40

1362
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,375
Well what I mean as far as like

1363
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,167
Some companies you would have liked

1364
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,239
Oh here's your new job title maybe it's in writing

1365
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,823
It hasn't necessarily been the case compared my other

1366
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
The other

1367
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,943
When you became managing editor the summer of 2018

1368
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
Did you receive a raise

1369
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,039
No

1370
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
How much do

1371
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,903
Anywhere from 75 to $90,000

1372
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
It's

1373
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,583
Based on the Range SM

1374
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Owatonna salary

1375
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,679
It is a salary position I think 75

1376
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,703
My base salary

1377
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,495
Can go up tonight eBay song

1378
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Performance

1379
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:46,431
75,000 is high but I think compared to the other salaries we've heard from people

1380
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:51,807
Who arranged that I find acceptable

1381
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
Right

1382
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
Wolf

1383
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:59,743
Still bums me out but you know what you brought me out if somebody who supports workers is that he got a raise

1384
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:05,375
Possibilities

1385
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,191
Stout one major issue that I almost

1386
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,751
Like in the back of my my no will come up

1387
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,287
Almost constantly

1388
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,919
Chip Daniels giving answers that he does not realize our begging Quest

1389
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
You know that like

1390
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,527
That's not really the culture we have here at Infowars

1391
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:28,927
The question what the f*** is the cultured Infowars

1392
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:34,047
Helicopter

1393
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:40,447
Yeah I think you're right though he does open doors with with answers that

1394
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:45,311
Is kind of fun because I think that bill as a person holding a deposition

1395
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,335
Is

1396
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:52,735
The sort whose like I'll walk through that door that leads to some pretty

1397
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
Exchanges

1398
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:58,879
It's okay it makes $75,000 a year in possibility of 90

1399
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Philz Coffee

1400
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,439
Gets bonuses okay

1401
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,583
Sherbrooke I mean who wouldn't put that way

1402
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
Did you receive a bonus into

1403
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,751
Unless your credit on a 2 years ago yes I did

1404
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
Do you remember what that

1405
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,079
That was probably a prox

1406
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,127
For the year

1407
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,407
12 to 13000

1408
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Seems like the company

1409
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,247
Was doing

1410
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,879
The performance the company was better in 2020 than

1411
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
Something like that

1412
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
What about 2,000

1413
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
19

1414
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,279
Does Proxima

1415
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,351
+ 80

1416
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
It's been awhile since I've looked at my double

1417
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
2018

1418
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,519
But if we wanted to find that information out of would be in there.

1419
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
Yes

1420
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,943
Have you ever had a year where you did not receive a bonus

1421
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
I don't believe so

1422
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,551
Are you aware that Free Speech systems is rough

1423
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,855
As they stayed in the swamp

1424
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,647
Over 50 million dollars

1425
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,207
No I wasn't aware that

1426
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,255
Do you think people should be getting bonuses

1427
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
If that's the night

1428
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
Real.

1429
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
I want to be the person to

1430
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,631
Make that judgment

1431
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
If you were running

1432
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Company

1433
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
Was that indebted

1434
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
When you be giving bonuses

1435
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,031
Possibly not

1436
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:26,687
Earnest

1437
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:32,831
All the people that I've heard opposed the only person I don't feel his salary

1438
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:39,231
The rest of these people are outrageous hacks and make way too much and don't get me wrong kid is a hack to but he's making under 6

1439
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,327
Figures

1440
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:49,983
I can see an argument for someone like him being worth a decent salary because honestly without the people who run the site and managed

1441
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,311
The articles I go up there be no way the show could exist

1442
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:59,199
Alex can't curate that shoot himself and if you were forced to report on articles of that tailor-made headlines room to yell about

1443
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,991
He sure would suffer from that

1444
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,647
People who write the articles on who repost other outlets articles with new headlines are really the backbone of what makes Alex's show function

1445
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:12,255
And with Paul Joseph Watson doing a lot less that heavy lifting in the past few years

1446
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,327
Someone like it probably does have real value

1447
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:21,727
Compare with someone like him bring to the table to someone like Owen or Harrison night think you would rather have kid around

1448
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:25,055
Just about any day

1449
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,615
You know I don't like that he's paid as much as he is but

1450
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:34,015
Relatively speaking I think he needs to unionize in order to get a better contract for himself because there's no

1451
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:40,415
David Harrison Smith should be making that much more than him pay Owen like 15 an hour

1452
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:46,815
Respectable and even though I'm philosophically opposed to them I would offer Harrison it wouldn't give him anything

1453
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,351
Passing unpaid internship

1454
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:55,007
The thing that I find really interesting about this clip and so many other moments in this deposition is the clear information based

1455
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,335
Power imbalance between the lawyer and the person being deposed

1456
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,407
No idea that Infowars is deeply in debt

1457
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:07,807
Later Owen is going to talk about how he has no idea what archives are databases the company keeps heading no one told him that he received

1458
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,855
The court order for Discovery in this case

1459
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,951
This is because employers is a deeply compartmentalised workplace

1460
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:20,351
Alex keeps so much information from people who work there you can see hook me completely caught off guard to hear these kind of

1461
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
Lesions in a deposition setting

1462
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
And that's for this that I'm not really sure how much of this is just normal for a business

1463
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
But it seems pretty high

1464
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:36,223
So I can see him being really deep in the soup but I don't know what the full picture of this is

1465
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,039
Until until more information comes out

1466
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:44,159
Taken at face value it's obviously surprise into kid and it sounds bad

1467
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:48,767
I mean it might be just a quibble with Bill is just like you know

1468
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,423
I think the employee should be treated regardless of whether or not the owners of the company have

1469
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
50 million dollars a day

1470
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,495
Song saying I think

1471
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,567
I think in an Ideal World.

1472
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:06,943
Maybe a business can't function 50 million dollars

1473
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,063
But something like Alex there is something of the realpolitik to it yes so

1474
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,111
Chip is asked about like

1475
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,951
This the Dynamics of how they get article gets Papa

1476
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:21,023
You did you publish this yourself

1477
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,839
Right you were able to hit the button and Publishing

1478
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,399
Exhibit one

1479
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,471
Do you recognize it

1480
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Piloswine

1481
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,311
This is a

1482
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,103
Rolling update article I

1483
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,663
Wrote in February 14th 2018

1484
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,479
Regarding the breaking news

1485
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,015
On the

1486
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,551
Florida shooting

1487
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,879
When you say the Florida shooting you mean the Parkland

1488
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,647
Yes

1489
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,975
Florida high school shooting PS

1490
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,047
Who published the song

1491
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,327
I did

1492
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
Did anybody help you

1493
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:00,959
No

1494
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:07,359
When you write a story in publishing you have the ability to upload it to the website you're on your own

1495
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,919
Who all has that capability

1496
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,759
The writers that I just mentioned except Dan Lyman usually

1497
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,807
Submitted stories for one of the

1498
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
Staff writers

1499
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,599
Publish for him

1500
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,767
The managing editor have to put eyes on every story that goes up

1501
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,047
That is my practice

1502
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
Is that a requirement

1503
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,935
It's not necessarily requirement bed something I do in practice

1504
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,215
Have you always

1505
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,263
No

1506
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Why not

1507
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,639
It just kind of something that

1508
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
After all these lawsuits and litigation I kind of

1509
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,015
Decided for myself that that was something I needed to do them

1510
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:53,951
I think most people would hear this and just move along but I think it's nuts

1511
01:18:54,463 --> 01:19:00,607
This clip is probably the only time in any of these depositions that I've heard someone Express that in response to all of the lawsuit

1512
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:07,007
And forwards is facing that they decided they needed to do a better job

1513
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:13,407
Are you saying that you saw a problem took responsibility and then changed your

1514
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,175
Xavier.

1515
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:20,575
F****** blows my mind yeah that's really basic thing for normal people it's a super low bar to clear before

1516
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:26,975
Employees that deserves a standing ovation

1517
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:32,863
Since this point kit is not done a better job any articles that go up on the website are still totally full of b*******.

1518
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,447
Yes he has the ability to recognize that he needs to do better

1519
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:43,103
I'm going to assume that he has a problem with follow through or maybe as a boss that needs him to do a bad job to keep the company in

1520
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:49,503
I applaud this impulse on a very basic level

1521
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
Make a difference at all but

1522
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:56,671
Impressive all the same I think you know what it is about what you do and not about what you say but

1523
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:03,327
Doing something like saying this is so unreal for it if it were deployed

1524
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:08,191
Sort of touching on a little bit of that naivete

1525
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:14,592
It doesn't behoove you to say something like that it makes you look like a better or more rational

1526
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:20,992
But it doesn't help you with the deposition and

1527
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:27,392
Your best defense at Infowars is pretending you've never heard of Infowars what is

1528
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,208
Morals

1529
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,768
So there's a interesting

1530
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:39,424
I'll say in this in this tire Exchange

1531
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,704
Deposition

1532
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,104
Pops back up it rears its head is are you a journalist

1533
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,432
What is a journal what do you do right

1534
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:56,832
Kit has called himself a journalist in the past

1535
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,624
The dresses back here

1536
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,696
When you publish an article who does the

1537
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,072
If it's an article I'm doing typically of myself

1538
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
What's your training

1539
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,448
I took some

1540
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,984
Classes in

1541
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,568
First off I have used the word journalism

1542
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:21,920
Maybe I'll dig nurse before I kind of see myself more as a social commentator

1543
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
Since when

1544
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,784
I think my whole

1545
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,600
Has been more about social commentator

1546
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,392
When did know when did you start

1547
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:35,232
Characterizing yourself as a social comment

1548
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:41,376
I think I started reading some Glenn Greenwald articles past couple months

1549
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,680
And, made me realize the way he approaches

1550
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,216
Who sings a lot different than the way I pray

1551
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:53,408
No the kids been reading Greenwald to lately as opposed to the other points in his career

1552
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:59,808
That's not true I think it probably learned about him from appearances on Tucker

1553
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
That would make sense

1554
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:07,232
Another interesting thing to point out is that all of these people say that they don't consider themselves that much of journalists and their Maureen

1555
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,768
The social commentary

1556
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,864
I don't think they really changes much but it's so consistent in these depositions

1557
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:18,496
That I think there must have been a company meeting

1558
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:24,896
Tell that opens up a box of of worms we don't want to hear I want to open so it we can rely on

1559
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:31,296
Commentator is definitely a Barnes repandus

1560
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:36,416
Feels like something that is useful to appear to have less responsibility

1561
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,720
But I don't know if it helps

1562
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,072
The intersection of Lake are you a journalist

1563
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:49,472
I may have said I was in the past described as a weird who's on first

1564
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:53,056
107 kit

1565
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,336
That's the thing that Ivan

1566
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,128
When I first started in Ford it is very

1567
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,920
I understand your frustration

1568
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,688
With the two

1569
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,480
It's X get this

1570
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,296
But after this maybe this will be

1571
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,832
What's the difference between

1572
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
You and I

1573
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,672
I don't go out and talked

1574
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,208
Torches like one-on-one

1575
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,512
Like I'm not going to go get a news tip

1576
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
Somebody and talk to him on Signal

1577
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,328
Let me ask you this

1578
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
Did you

1579
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,400
Go out to a Bernie

1580
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,936
Sanders protest and talk to me

1581
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,472
Yes those are source

1582
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:25,056
I don't know if I called sources I was just kind of give them an offer

1583
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,104
Opportunity to vent their frustrations with

1584
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,408
What was going on

1585
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:34,272
You're interviewing people for information correct

1586
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,064
What their opinions were

1587
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,856
About the matter and then you took

1588
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:44,256
What what you gathered from those sources of information and then you wrote articles are or made videos about

1589
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:47,584
Let me finish my question

1590
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120
I just

1591
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,400
Wow

1592
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
Call boy

1593
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:54,752
Information for people that he report it

1594
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,568
I don't have a disability

1595
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:01,664
Here's where here's where I feel like social commentator falls apart

1596
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,248
Is that they feel like it's more honest than journalist

1597
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,880
Right but it's still behind something like what they should just say is like

1598
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,184
Guess I'm a professional assholes

1599
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:17,792
I am addicted to people and their reaction is what we sell

1600
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:24,192
Have you ever heard that Denis Leary song and then I feel like people would be like

1601
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,240
That's probably about as accurate as you're going to get

1602
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:32,384
Yeah I don't I feel like it would be tougher for a lot of Alex's audience to

1603
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:39,040
Get excited about the professional a******

1604
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:44,160
I think that might tarnish their image a little bit and I pay him for it

1605
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:50,048
We'll come back up of course but

1606
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:56,448
Did the questions on the table now is that if you're reporting a story is it more important to be accurate

1607
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
First

1608
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:02,848
Oregon a quick to get the story out do not answer this question

1609
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,408
Or answer poorly

1610
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,480
Ask mr. Shroyer the same question that I'm about to

1611
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,040
Foreshadowing you believe

1612
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,856
It's more important to get the news right

1613
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,648
Or to be the first to report

1614
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,696
I think it's both

1615
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,232
Really yes

1616
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:22,048
You don't think that veracity of the story

1617
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,328
Far

1618
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,400
Is far more important than

1619
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:28,448
It being reported before anybody else

1620
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:32,800
Know what I believe is that you also you want to be as accurate as

1621
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
As you can be

1622
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,616
But the same time you want to

1623
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
Timely

1624
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
I mean look

1625
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,224
Text dumb

1626
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,064
You don't want to ever say that

1627
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,464
You can sacrifice for your obligation to like be correct

1628
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:56,864
If it's in the interest of getting things off at something would say

1629
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:02,496
The most important thing to us is the truth spy

1630
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:09,152
Well obviously we've got to get it out time when there's a push-pull of Economics here but they wouldn't

1631
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,480
I think that the reality is

1632
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,296
Obviously there's an incentive

1633
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:21,696
4 things to be immediate when there are new stories of course but is in no way

1634
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:28,096
More important than that you're always suppose you can't get an accurate story you shouldn't run with it for the sake

1635
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:31,680
Ecospeed I don't think that is the

1636
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,728
What's what can't is describing

1637
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:40,128
I think he's saying like I would say you get it as right as you can get it so long as you get it out the door

1638
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:45,248
Oh wait no that means that I put timeliness way ahead of it

1639
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,576
In discussing the speed thing

1640
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:56,000
Reviews some stuff about how he views his responsibility to the audience and vice versa

1641
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,048
That I find troubling

1642
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,096
When you rode exhibit 1

1643
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,168
Was there any rush to put this article out

1644
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,448
Yes it was breaking

1645
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,496
Story

1646
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,544
Because nobody

1647
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:13,408
Shooting just occurred within a couple hours and was in the public interest to kind of

1648
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,200
Kind of figure out what the motivation

1649
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
Michigan Works

1650
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,296
Why did you why do you think the public needed to know the motivation to

1651
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,880
That's how the new Cycle Works

1652
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:27,232
Webster people unfortunately people don't want to know things to 34 days

1653
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
Later

1654
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Okay

1655
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,840
Infowars

1656
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
They're not journalist

1657
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,400
There's no race

1658
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,984
Wouldn't they have plenty of time to make sure what they're

1659
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,776
Providing the people is

1660
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:44,384
Well unfortunately our audience kind of dictates

1661
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,408
Our time frame

1662
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
How so

1663
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,528
Well they're just not going to be interest in a story that's 45 days old

1664
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
Why do you think that

1665
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,600
Because the public

1666
01:27:54,112 --> 01:28:00,000
Hands too if they have their eyes set on a prefix their story that happens that moment a time that's where their eyeballs are going

1667
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,840
Look it's revealing a couple of really important things here

1668
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:08,704
The first has to do with the relationship between the audience and the producers of the content

1669
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:15,360
Kid believes that he has to rush out stories whether they're accurate or not because the audiences tomorrow about what happened

1670
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,128
Today

1671
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:19,968
But the reality is that he has this relationship backwards

1672
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:26,368
Infowars is cultivated and trained this response from Their audience through the constant bombardment of flashy headlines and imminent

1673
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
Predictions of

1674
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,416
Terrorist nukes in

1675
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,440
FEMA camps

1676
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:35,840
Everything that's happening today is reported as cataclysmic because it needs to be to capture the maximum amount of attention

1677
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:40,960
And if you want a chance at retaining any eyeball tomorrow the headlines better be just as flashy

1678
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:47,104
Just a severe and probably not about the same thing you were yelling about the day before that's not going to be as exciting

1679
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:50,432
Alex is trained isn't his audience partially because it's easier

1680
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:53,248
I'm partially because he can't operate any other way

1681
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:57,088
If Imports took the time to flesh out stories and do follow-up reporting

1682
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:03,488
Just about everything they cover would be revealed to be b******* and they spend all their time on are correcting the s*** they said yesterday

1683
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:09,888
Being interesting show I think it would be as it like this catch last week's

1684
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,360
Work distracting the audience as soon as the next cycle hit

1685
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:24,992
And yet you have a very strong incentive to not flush out stories anyway because they don't hold up to scrutiny

1686
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
They did this to Their audience

1687
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,368
But the Wake it understands it there just responding to Market pressure

1688
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:34,208
This is kind of sad but I do think that I believe he believes it

1689
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:39,072
No I I feel like one of the things that I'm running into here and the reason that

1690
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:44,960
Bill specifically said he's a more sympathetic figure it's simply because it

1691
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
Appears that he

1692
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:50,336
Has been told all of these things and then just believe.

1693
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,408
Yeah yeah there is

1694
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:59,808
Yeah it's it's it's weird thing to run into because is a sincerity to it

1695
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,576
That doesn't

1696
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,880
It doesn't feel artificial

1697
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:09,280
Cuz what it is he's never asked himself

1698
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:15,680
A follow-up question the way ever had to he's never had to so bill is asking him questions that he's he's sitting there thinking like

1699
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:22,592
I've never even thought of this question before this is kind of interesting as revealing is

1700
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:28,736
We internal way that Infowars kind of understand that metaphor that I refer to as the Kiewit concrete thing

1701
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:32,320
Propaganda is really only stick if you're able to implant them early

1702
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:37,184
You need to have something happen and then provide the narrative for your audience to understand the event through

1703
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:43,840
If you can succeed at that your audience will be more likely to evaluate any further things they hear about the event through the prism

1704
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,632
Some of your conspiracy narrative

1705
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,192
As opposed to looking at the details independently

1706
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:55,104
There's a critical aspect of getting narratives to stick it is reflecting the a basic understanding of this but just from

1707
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,128
The Producers site

1708
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:02,528
Do you want water think that's what he's doing because it's inherently abusive to an audience and it's entirely dishonest

1709
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,320
But this is that dynamic

1710
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:10,976
When he says that the audience wouldn't be interested in old news what he's actually saying is that by the time stories a few days old

1711
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,048
Kris already dried and whatever angle he's going to try and sell

1712
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,328
It isn't going to stick

1713
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:22,240
I find the most fascinating about this perspective is that I completely agree with just about everything that kid is describing in terms of

1714
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,568
What are whether or not the audience would care about a couple days old

1715
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,592
New story

1716
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,408
Do a fundamental disconnect in terms of Y

1717
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:35,808
I blame Infowars at Alex where is get seems to blame the audience for how they're fickle

1718
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:38,880
Wouldn't give it to him and it's like it's like oh

1719
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:45,280
Just because I go into some community and give them a ton of heroin people want heroin that has nothing to do with it man

1720
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,560
People always want heroin

1721
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:50,400
There's there's there's something to that metaphor

1722
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,680
So

1723
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:56,288
Navigate to some of the details about the actual article that kit wrote

1724
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:02,944
I wanted the pieces of information that he put into the article was about how Nikolas Cruz

1725
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,016
The shooter in Parkland was a Democrat

1726
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,320
Figured this out was

1727
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,112
Voter records

1728
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:10,880
Novice

1729
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,672
Man

1730
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:15,488
This first sentence is the first sentence of the story

1731
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
Yes

1732
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,304
And it ends with

1733
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,352
Voter records

1734
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:24,960
Voter record suggests nineteen-year-old Nikolas Cruz

1735
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,264
Was a democratic voter

1736
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,456
Where did you get voter Reg

1737
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:40,832
If I remember correctly I do the search I think Florida has a

1738
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,136
I think voter records in Florida Republic

1739
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,952
Okay so for this story

1740
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,536
You weren't reporting on what other people are saying you went out

1741
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,096
Found voter records on your own

1742
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,120
Yes

1743
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,144
Does journalist

1744
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
True

1745
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,824
Can't really commentate on

1746
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,384
What's happening in the media if you're reporting something

1747
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,664
Nobody else

1748
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,200
Unless it's

1749
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,504
I'm sorry I'm trying my new little bit fuzzy

1750
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:12,320
Unless this is something I found somewhere else

1751
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:17,184
You remember that believe that Florida's

1752
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,768
Minor saying was Florida's

1753
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
Voter registration is

1754
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
Public

1755
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:26,400
Although this might have been a screenshot account for somebody else

1756
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,448
So you don't even know where it came

1757
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:33,568
What my understanding is it came from the Florida I probably didn't go back and verify it to make sure this

1758
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,128
Not just something philia made out of

1759
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,920
Okay so you do go and verify

1760
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:38,944
Yes

1761
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,968
Is not journalism

1762
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,760
It just something that's good practice

1763
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
For who

1764
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:48,160
So you here you go and verify things for the audio

1765
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,976
To best my ability

1766
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:54,304
But I was I was kind of getting to a point

1767
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:00,704
Around here where is getting a little annoying

1768
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,544
Big great I am I am starting to recognize

1769
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,616
Why I was not invited to the deposition

1770
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:14,016
I feel like I wouldn't be able to keep quite a same solid phases as you and Bill

1771
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:19,648
Appear for them

1772
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,744
Sure there is a there's an expectation of decorum all I will say

1773
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:30,400
Alert at one point there is an audible last

1774
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:36,800
I enjoy and I will give you a heads-up.

1775
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,616
Like is this journalism is what you're doing journalism

1776
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,944
Is just on answerable this is just such a

1777
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,736
Such a murky pit

1778
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,528
When you agree that

1779
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,064
Journalist have a duty

1780
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
Would you agree with that

1781
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,208
That's what urinals do

1782
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,256
So if journalist

1783
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,560
We're reporting an Instagram account

1784
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,632
Be fair to say since this was within hours of

1785
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,400
The shooting

1786
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,936
They were verifying

1787
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,520
Well unfortunately that's what you

1788
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,568
That's what you and me would like to believe

1789
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
What

1790
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:14,432
And growing up that's how I always thought of traditional media

1791
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,016
But unfortunately I saw an article in axios recently

1792
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,576
Am I finding excuses little bit left-leaning

1793
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,880
They pointed out that

1794
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,672
Trust In traditional media

1795
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,696
Is like

1796
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Plummeting

1797
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:27,744
I agree

1798
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,280
Let me ask you this

1799
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,328
How did that answer my

1800
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:37,984
I do like that but let me ask you this

1801
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,800
What is that

1802
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,360
So this is in relation to

1803
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:48,736
The notion that it's given in kits article headlined the sub-headline

1804
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:53,856
That the media somehow covering something up about the Parkland shooter this is that

1805
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:57,696
You know a complaint I guess is best is Cape connects plane

1806
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,536
But no one else is covering the the Instagram

1807
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:07,936
Workout plan so bills conjecture is maybe they're checking things

1808
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:14,336
Under is that there's a

1809
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:18,944
This is not related at all

1810
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,968
Unfortunately

1811
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,040
This leads to

1812
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:28,672
Getting getting some parts out about statistics

1813
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,208
This leads to a brick wall

1814
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm not into

1815
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,280
Newsrooms that some of these

1816
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,048
Organization

1817
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:37,376
Right so you shouldn't really have an opinion one way or the other

1818
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,424
Well it's not my opinion when I

1819
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,728
Say that I axios reported that

1820
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,008
Public Trust

1821
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,544
At all time lows

1822
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,336
And that was a sample of

1823
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,360
The General Public

1824
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,896
Crack I believe so

1825
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,688
You don't know who they say I am

1826
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,480
Crack

1827
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,016
Well if it's over

1828
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,040
Reminder Sam

1829
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,344
Being an economics major if it's over 30

1830
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,368
Maybe citizen

1831
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,136
Sickly

1832
01:36:59,392 --> 01:36:59,904
Important

1833
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
I mean

1834
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,048
Apps

1835
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,072
Absolutely necessary

1836
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,352
Reliable

1837
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,376
Not just

1838
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144
Over 30

1839
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,424
Geographical age

1840
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,960
Gender all of those go in

1841
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,008
Subject subject

1842
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
Cracked

1843
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,360
That's what you're saying I don't know that

1844
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,640
Statistics and so

1845
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
I'm starting

1846
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,688
Statistical principle

1847
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,968
Okay do you know that

1848
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:24,992
No

1849
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,016
Then let's not talk about

1850
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:37,024
Do you know anything about this

1851
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,304
How about this

1852
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,584
I'm going to give you a gift

1853
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,984
Hang yourself right now the doors to get open

1854
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,592
Buddy

1855
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:56,992
The article itself some of the 30

1856
01:37:57,248 --> 01:38:03,392
Because of context right I can't tell if he means over 30 people polled or if it's over 30%

1857
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:16,192
Believe it it seems like that's what he's saying based on context you're being overly generous

1858
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
30%

1859
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:20,544
Send it to Jessica

1860
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,944
It could be could be seen as relevant a pole as statistically relevant

1861
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,504
As long as you ask more than 30 people

1862
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:35,904
That's why I do not believe in education anymore I don't think it can save us

1863
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:42,304
30% to be statistically relevant then

1864
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,704
9/11 was an inside job

1865
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,032
I don't know that is not a statistic

1866
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,592
So the article itself

1867
01:38:54,848 --> 01:39:00,992
Claims in it where they attack it was saying that the shooter dressed like a communist

1868
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:05,856
Also dressed like and Isis fighter in Syria

1869
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:08,160
These were claims that were made

1870
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:14,560
Based on Nicholas cruises Instagram Instagram page that you found

1871
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,584
Bellefonte

1872
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,888
They pad was found on 4chan

1873
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,936
That

1874
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
The kid

1875
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,264
Miss identified as

1876
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:29,664
And so we we get into a little bit of this the claims of the Communists dressing the supporting Isis

1877
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
That's not good for cat

1878
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,016
Would you agree with me that

1879
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,160
Reported Florida shooter dressed as communist

1880
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,184
Is false

1881
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:48,608
If what I was 50 headline had to do with Fontaine photo then yes I would agree with you

1882
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,728
Would you also agree with me that

1883
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,032
Reported Florida shooter dressed as it

1884
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:57,056
As communist

1885
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:00,128
, supported Isis that's awesome

1886
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:03,456
I don't know because if I remember correctly

1887
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,320
His Instagram account said things like Allah Akbar

1888
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:14,976
And his these photos in the Instagram account just looks like something I would expect an Isis fighter

1889
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,256
Iraq to dress like

1890
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:22,912
Interesting spider in a wreck but it constantly goes back to see her yet for some reason

1891
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,680
And

1892
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:30,336
This is this is kind of an interesting notion like why do you think this looks like an Isis fight

1893
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:33,664
This could not go more poorly for kit

1894
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:39,808
Cuz I can already tell you what stone answer is right now I can just be like hey who knows what's in a man's heart

1895
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,160
That's it and then he's like that's all I got for you

1896
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,952
I think that's a

1897
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:51,072
Some level of don't answer this would have been appropriate

1898
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:54,400
It just fumbles the ball game time

1899
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,680
It's embarrassing

1900
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:59,264
The article that you wrote says Additionally the shooters garb

1901
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:03,104
Is very similar to the style worn by ISIS Fighters

1902
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,128
Fighters

1903
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
In stereo

1904
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,688
I read that correctly

1905
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Yes

1906
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:14,112
When we look at the image that you included in this article there are

1907
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,184
5 pictures of

1908
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,512
Allegedly Nicholas Cruise correct

1909
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,048
Yes

1910
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,864
And is this the

1911
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:28,448
The collage of photos that you drew

1912
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,264
The Isis fighters in Syria

1913
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
Coming from

1914
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,056
I believe so yes

1915
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,616
Is it normal for Isis Fighters

1916
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,152
Syria to wear

1917
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,456
United States Army

1918
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,272
Well I was looking at

1919
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
The masseter

1920
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:48,672
And the kind of the nice how he's holding

1921
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:53,536
So you say the United States Army

1922
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,328
I mean I do remember the

1923
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:58,144
There was a big controversy

1924
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:02,240
Bryce's Fighters I believe is in Syria were using a pickup truck from a

1925
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,264
Plumber in Houston

1926
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:06,080
I still had his logo on it

1927
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,176
So there's no telling I mean yeah possibly

1928
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,200
So it's

1929
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,504
Based on urinalysis it's fair the

1930
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,296
The videographer Heroes dress

1931
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,856
As an Isis member fighting in City

1932
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,160
Now he's actually pretty dress pretty well

1933
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:23,232
I know plumbers in Houston that dress like

1934
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,048
Porsche truck

1935
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,096
OK Google

1936
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:34,496
That's why you don't need to answer that

1937
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:40,896
Offer information at a deposition I think probably there's poor preparation

1938
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,712
These kinds of justifications

1939
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,528
Her like why did you think that

1940
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:52,928
In his normal life that's good enough

1941
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,696
Too many like

1942
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:58,048
Critical people of his worldview and if he does maybe it's at like

1943
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,864
Someplace where you have the camera and it's hostile base

1944
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,008
About yelling at each other doesn't have to actually question himself

1945
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,104
Why did you think this person look like a Isis fighter in Syria

1946
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:17,504
He was wearing a mask and is an American army hat but also a plumber in

1947
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,064
Houston's truck was in Syria

1948
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:25,184
It's just convoluted fence and it gets worse it just gets worse

1949
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,744
So if he was if the videographer here

1950
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,792
Was wearing US Army

1951
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,328
You would

1952
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,352
You you can

1953
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,632
Infer from that

1954
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,936
That he was dressed as a fighter in Syria

1955
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,728
Well it wasn't the hat that I was

1956
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
Picking up

1957
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,776
Specifically it's just

1958
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,312
The whole collage of the image

1959
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,336
The whole thing

1960
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,896
The fact that the guys wearing masks

1961
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:47,968
If you will what's today's daf

1962
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,760
Spider and I definitely like to wear mask

1963
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Whatever reason

1964
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:56,672
Interesting pictures of people wearing masks that Mountain Bicycles yes okay so

1965
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:02,048
We could throw that one out as reliable anything else you got in here that's reliable as far as somebody dressed

1966
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,584
Like an Isis fighter

1967
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:06,656
Well the photos I've seen of Isis Fighters

1968
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,704
City that were definitely very similar to how he

1969
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,568
How many how many photos of Isis fighters in Syria

1970
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
Have you seen

1971
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,104
A lot

1972
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,408
Okay and based on that

1973
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,200
Nikolas Cruz right here

1974
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,480
Is dress like that

1975
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,552
Pass office Halloween costumes

1976
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:26,880
It could also pass off as a bank robber

1977
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,904
In the United States

1978
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,696
Why do honor synonym

1979
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:36,096
I think a bank robbery think of someone wearing a presidential mask okay

1980
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,680
Other than that very specific and extremely random comment

1981
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:46,080
We'll go on to have you ever seen photos of Eye of of Taliban forces in Afghanistan

1982
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,152
Any of them wear masks

1983
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,176
Possibly

1984
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,456
We didn't have that in the article

1985
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:55,808
Alabama was I don't even think the Taliban was in the news

1986
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,832
The time is mainly nice

1987
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:59,136
If you don't you don't think or you don't know

1988
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,160
I do remember

1989
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,976
Okay well then we can dismiss that comment and you can

1990
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,048
Okay why didn't you add

1991
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,608
Taliban forces in Afghanistan

1992
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,168
Because in the new cycle the time

1993
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,192
It was license

1994
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,216
Is

1995
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:19,616
Is it extremely popular and sometimes often required for members of the Tamil Tigers to wear masks exactly

1996
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:20,384
Like that

1997
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,920
Tamil tigers

1998
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,200
I'm not Friday with that

1999
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:26,784
The second largest terrorist organization in the world you don't have to know I'm not

2000
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,832
Okay that's bad luck

2001
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:35,232
Don't know who the Tamil tigers for a receipt

2002
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:41,632
Geopolitical website need to redo the roster

2003
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:47,776
Oscar's cuz that's best supporting actor level s*** right there that was hilarious that is a funny man

2004
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:51,360
It's pretty dry delivery

2005
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,408
Oh my God

2006
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,968
Oh my god when I pick a bank robber

2007
01:45:56,224 --> 01:46:02,368
I think the people were present and it like iMovie Point Break

2008
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:08,768
Boyfriend not like the traditional striped

2009
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:15,168
Do they have tommy guns and they shoot their names into the wall

2010
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:21,568
I would say the kit does not do a good job of Defending these assertions

2011
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:27,968
I mean be idea of not giving a s*** what it is whether or not it's Isis or Taliban or whomever

2012
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,016
Because what's in the news is Isis

2013
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:36,928
Sure that's kind of important revealed and it also kind of dovetails with what he saying about like whatever that you know

2014
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:40,256
The audience's eyes aren't going to be

2015
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,536
Wikipedia

2016
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:45,888
About that makes your contacts offer I believe

2017
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:49,472
Jump over to the notion that he had that

2018
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:52,544
The shooter supported Isis and where they came from

2019
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:57,664
I am just a heads up there is a ethnic slur

2020
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,760
Great in this is part of the explanation for his course of course

2021
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:06,112
And here you did say the shooters is garbage very similar

2022
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:06,880
Right

2023
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:10,720
But when we look at page 1 you say he's supported Isis

2024
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,280
Well there was a

2025
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:17,376
If I remember correctly and his Instagram account he said something about Allah Akbar

2026
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,400
How to bake 3

2027
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:28,384
You see the screenshot on page three of his

2028
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,944
Nikolas Cruz in the

2029
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,480
Voter registration

2030
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,504
Yes

2031
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,576
You see the caption on the Instagram post

2032
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,136
Can you read it

2033
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,280
I believe it says well at least we now know what it means when a sander kisses Ella Akbar

2034
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,304
Does that sound like

2035
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,120
Anyone in the world that would support Isis

2036
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,424
I have no idea

2037
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,240
Okay then why on Earth would you drive

2038
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,544
Your headline from a sentence

2039
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,312
But you don't

2040
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,616
It was I don't believe I drive

2041
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,432
Yes I believe I've derived it from something

2042
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,480
Cruz said on his Instagram account

2043
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,016
This is Instagram

2044
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,088
Another comment you made on another post news

2045
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,856
Instagram account

2046
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:13,696
Surely you would have included that in your article since your headlines that he

2047
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
Possibly

2048
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:19,072
Possibly could happen

2049
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:25,728
So yeah he decided that the just the fact that Allah Akbar rights included with

2050
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,752
In the body of this

2051
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,824
Is that also includes a slur

2052
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,896
Very specific slur

2053
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,432
That means that he supports

2054
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:40,832
Yeah I would go the other direction

2055
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:46,720
You can really derive from this is the level of attention to detail

2056
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,536
Let someone who's in a managerial role

2057
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,816
Hidden for warriors

2058
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:53,632
Engages with his contact with bats

2059
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:59,520
The scary thing is I mean I'm just shocked at the

2060
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:01,824
Like complete admission of

2061
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,128
Maurice just said just lack of curiosity

2062
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:12,320
I can't believe I can't believe that you would have no idea what that means and not be like I better take a look at that

2063
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,856
Sure you know

2064
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,136
You just

2065
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:18,464
Ignore entire parts of sentences

2066
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:24,864
Eleanor drive to cuz you just like I don't need to ask question well the level of lack of curiosity and lack of

2067
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:28,704
Knowledge base

2068
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,496
Spell idly. I believe that

2069
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
But

2070
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,568
Before we get to any of that

2071
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,664
Which is why you find one of the more staggering admissions

2072
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,456
That will get you in a second

2073
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,736
But before that

2074
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:44,320
Did conversation of like why did you need to

2075
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:48,160
The report based on this Instagram

2076
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,184
Something that you

2077
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,232
Felt

2078
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:54,048
Well based on Instagram that's at the time

2079
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,328
The shooting just occurred

2080
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:59,168
And unfortunately that's kind of all we had to go with

2081
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:01,216
To kind of try to figure out

2082
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,264
What this means motivation for

2083
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,032
So maybe

2084
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,312
Besides Beck's motivation

2085
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,080
4

2086
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,664
Because information was so limited

2087
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,456
Maybe you should have slowed down

2088
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,504
Wells breaking news story

2089
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,272
Are you

2090
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,064
Canal's for Valiant

2091
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:23,488
So the audience and tell us the motivation at the time who did the audience Infowars

2092
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,048
Got a call from the audience that said we want to know right now

2093
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:31,936
Fletcher standard practices if the news cycle is if you see in every single news Outlet

2094
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
And on social media they're all talking about the

2095
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,008
Shooting

2096
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,800
That's where the audience is eyeballs

2097
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:43,456
Okay where did it come from that the audience needed to know the motivation immediately to the point where

2098
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:45,248
Were you just start throwing darts in the dark

2099
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,320
Well I should Powell is kind in the public interest

2100
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,368
Well that's what people are asking

2101
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,416
Sitting here today looking back

2102
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:55,744
At the veracity of your article do you really think this article was in the publishing

2103
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,304
It was in the public interest

2104
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,376
To try to determine what the motivation for behind a mass shooting

2105
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:04,192
You would agree with me that one thing that is never

2106
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:04,960
In the public

2107
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:06,752
Is somebody who is

2108
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:08,288
Disseminating false information

2109
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,872
Well I mean

2110
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,920
With malice Maybe

2111
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,456
What does that mean

2112
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:18,016
What does that mean

2113
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,064
Why did you

2114
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:26,464
OfferUp an answer to a question that only only raises further questions

2115
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,488
Don't do it man

2116
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,144
Gotta look real yeah that is a real problem through a fair amount

2117
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:42,848
I do appreciate that bill has very clearly got a point to this

2118
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,384
Section of questioning at Leeds

2119
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,176
Which is that beginning of like

2120
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,456
What matters more

2121
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:52,064
Accuracy or timeliness and what he says both bill is very clearly going

2122
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:57,952
I'm going to dismantle the concept that you give a f*** about veracity and that it's all about time

2123
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,792
Yes yes and I appreciate that

2124
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,096
Kids doing such a good job

2125
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:10,752
Unfortunately kind of explaining why

2126
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:17,408
That immediacy is so important business model operator

2127
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:23,808
Basically money part of the you profit

2128
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,832
Off of Lies

2129
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:31,232
And hopeful recognition that what you're doing is clickbait right

2130
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:35,328
There's another thing that bill tries to nail down through this

2131
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:37,888
I like can you recognize that what you're doing

2132
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,912
Is clickbait

2133
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:43,008
End this conversation as it appears here

2134
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:46,592
Leads to what I would describe as the most staggering

2135
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,664
Admission of ignorance that you're going to hear

2136
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,504
Frankly I think it's a little weird his photos I mean why would you

2137
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:57,856
Your Instagram account just be nothing but clothes you wear match going on

2138
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,928
Well I mean I think you're trying

2139
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,768
Are you trying to make sense

2140
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,816
Of an individual who brought

2141
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,608
Guns to his high school

2142
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,888
And killed a bunch of people

2143
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:12,960
I wouldn't say since maybe like motivation

2144
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,240
Okay

2145
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,288
Why

2146
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:18,080
Why did you have to do it right then and there

2147
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,872
Because that's where the audience

2148
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,640
Paying attention

2149
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,200
Right so this is clickbait

2150
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:27,040
It's unreliable information about a story the audience wants to read about

2151
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,064
Tatacliq

2152
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
That's your opinion

2153
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,904
What's your what's your opinion of clicked

2154
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,440
When I use it what do you think

2155
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,976
Why don't really

2156
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:38,560
Engaging clickbait so I'd only have a pain on if you don't return me

2157
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,120
You just use the term clickbait what you mean by

2158
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:44,448
I think clickbait is something like

2159
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:47,520
When you see an article on social media it's like

2160
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,824
Click here to find five

2161
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,104
Waze

2162
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:54,432
Find five household products that will clean your house spic-and-span

2163
01:53:55,200 --> 01:54:01,344
Right so it's like click here to find this out and then you click on it and there's no real information about that

2164
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,880
Yes okay

2165
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,928
So when it says he supported Isis

2166
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,464
Somebody clicked on your story

2167
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:08,000
We're in here

2168
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,328
Would they find that he supported Isis

2169
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:17,728
This based on what I saw on Instagram when find the information that he said

2170
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,032
Akbar comet

2171
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:20,800
Okay

2172
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,104
Which you have no idea what it even means

2173
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,432
I mean I know that's a phrase

2174
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,224
Isis Fighters use a lot

2175
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:33,088
It's also a phrase that every Muslim in the world

2176
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,112
Did you know that

2177
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,440
Not necessarily I'm not too familiar with

2178
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,976
You didn't know that

2179
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,768
Rockbar is

2180
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,608
A Muslim phrase that is used literally every day multiple times

2181
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,144
By every Muslim in the world

2182
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,960
I'm just not from that familiar with the Muslim ideology

2183
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,520
Oh my god wow

2184
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:56,128
Just f****** wow you guys need to know what you would say to that

2185
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
I mean

2186
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,920
I guess

2187
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:01,760
I guess it's easier to understand what that's what I would say is

2188
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:04,320
It's a lot easier to understand why you're a white supremacist

2189
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:11,232
Ankles if you are you clearly have no f****** clue what's going on

2190
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:17,632
This little information like would not be anywhere near the levers of talking about

2191
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:21,728
These topics publicly you would not be able to opine about

2192
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:26,592
Terrorism any issues related to Islam if you didn't have

2193
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:33,248
Some very basic pieces of ventilation and it's there we do not live in that thing

2194
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:39,648
World feel like a fundamental issue were running into here is Kent does not believe that words have immutable meaning

2195
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:46,560
I don't think most people that Infowars believe things outside of subjective

2196
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:49,888
He's like it when you asked me what a journalist is

2197
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,728
It's a word that has a meaning you never repeat that meeting back

2198
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:56,032
Cuz that's what a word means

2199
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:02,944
You know it could be like a when a bird flies and it drops information onto the ground

2200
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:09,344
Information is a is a seed in the seed becomes a tree and that's journalism

2201
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,440
The bird is Glenn greenwald's recent work

2202
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,232
Yeah

2203
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:21,632
And that seed is Obama bulshit this could have been another contact drive but it's just filthy language

2204
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:25,728
With the fact that I did not know what I look like Barbie okay

2205
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,776
When you wrote this article didn't

2206
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,056
It was your belief

2207
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,848
That Allah Akbar

2208
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:34,432
Was something that only people in Isis say

2209
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,736
That was my belief at

2210
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:40,320
Okay and since that time you've been promoted

2211
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:53,376
It's tough to resume stuff to wrestle with you no like

2212
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:58,496
Because of his

2213
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:04,896
Clear ignorance but it's also damning of Rob to help presumably his immediate supervisor Alex Jones

2214
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:07,456
The entire inner workings of Infowars that

2215
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:09,760
Mikey doesn't reach

2216
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:14,624
Basic standards for you didn't know what

2217
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,648
And

2218
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,672
You didn't

2219
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,696
Cover

2220
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:24,352
The topics the kid talks about where he draws conclusions about things based on the words out of appearance

2221
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:30,752
Strictly all right

2222
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:33,312
World I really understand much about

2223
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:39,712
Whatever maybe then you could be promoted if you're a good financial analyst

2224
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:44,576
But all who like back by meeting Jesus horrible amazing

2225
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,880
So that's incredible

2226
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:53,280
They're more incredible thing it was brought up that he reported that Nikolas Cruz

2227
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,048
Was a

2228
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:57,120
Presumably a Democrat based on voter registration

2229
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:01,984
Advanced news about that also included a screenshot of

2230
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,288
The Florida voter registration

2231
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,056
Guess

2232
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,872
Did you even realize

2233
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:10,688
The name isn't even spelled the same

2234
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:14,016
Not the, tonight's not even the same person

2235
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:15,808
Yeah I know why did

2236
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,088
Blurted out

2237
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,368
For that contention

2238
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,000
The name

2239
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:29,632
Does even match up and you overlooked me remember that there was an instance

2240
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:33,984
There was if I remember correctly there was two reported instances of his name

2241
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,264
Let me to get the time

2242
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,056
End it

2243
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:41,664
It wasn't until the next morning of the 15th were his correct spelling his name

2244
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,200
What's more prominent

2245
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,808
So when you wrote this story

2246
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:50,880
Alleging that this person supported Isis

2247
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,416
And was a communist

2248
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,720
You weren't even sure how to spell isn't

2249
01:58:55,744 --> 01:59:01,888
Just because the media at the time was recording like I think two different spellings of his name why'd you pick the one that you picked in the store

2250
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,656
Vital member

2251
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,216
You just pick one and said I will go

2252
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:09,312
I don't know if I did that I just don't remember that sound like Cooper reporting

2253
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,384
Does it sound like good report

2254
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,968
Well unfortunately when there's something in it

2255
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:19,296
News that's breaking

2256
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,856
The details tend to be a little muddy

2257
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,208
Right and they're muddy to buy

2258
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:27,744
Individuals

2259
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:33,120
Trying to pull. Or he's out of details that are not yet developed correct

2260
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:36,192
Well I'll give you an example for you

2261
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:37,216
Correct

2262
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,240
What was your question

2263
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:45,408
Yeah that stuff all right so when I describe my job

2264
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,944
It sounds good

2265
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:53,344
But then you describe it and it sounds bad and I don't understand your words cuz I feel like my job is good

2266
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,368
Not as bad

2267
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:01,024
Later that bill brings up and that is that there may have been multiple spellings of Nicholas

2268
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:07,424
Cruz's birthday that was release all you could have cross-reference that to figure out who it was

2269
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:12,032
Record and get seem surprised by this until I do not understand what

2270
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:17,664
Cross reference means describe that to me in Greater detail

2271
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,712
So cute his brought up

2272
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:25,088
It'll in the immediacy of story sometimes those breaking news things get a little bit muddy

2273
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,720
And Bill is suggested that maybe things are muddy when people try to force stories

2274
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:37,376
Might as well just been like you realize that you write that that's basically what he doesn't

2275
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,776
Muddy is because all the news organizations are chasing after the story and the details haven't been flushed out enough yet

2276
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,544
To report.

2277
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,568
Get Smart

2278
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,872
Write something like that

2279
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,688
You realize you're you're part of the problem

2280
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,224
Do you realize that

2281
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:55,808
Maybe in this instance

2282
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,112
I'm just saying

2283
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,136
You seem like

2284
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:02,976
You're sitting here today saying what you did in this story was was okay

2285
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,768
Do you think it was okay to do

2286
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:07,072
Okay so you realize you were wrong

2287
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:09,120
Okay and you realize

2288
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,144
You could have been way better

2289
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,424
Yes absolutely

2290
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,704
Okay you realize

2291
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,800
Nothing about any of these photos as anything to do with Communism or supporting

2292
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:20,128
Signers in that now yes that one when you start understanding

2293
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:24,224
How did you realize

2294
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:28,064
When you get inside the car as Isis

2295
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:34,464
Tell her before I just instructed you on one anybody who actually supported Isis would

2296
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,232
Never

2297
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:37,280
Use the term sandercoe

2298
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,328
Yeah I wasn't aware of that term

2299
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:46,240
You didn't even know what it meant you didn't Google any of this you just saw it and said oh I recognize two of those words must be iced

2300
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:50,336
What was the breaking news story at the time for you I would assume so

2301
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,616
Goof

2302
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:58,016
I feel like a lot of my responses to these clips at this time

2303
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:00,064
This is

2304
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:02,368
This is a boxing match

2305
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:08,512
I mean just the Mike Tyson versus us

2306
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,584
Yeah if

2307
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,888
Although at the same time here's what I feel like

2308
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:16,192
I feel like listening to now

2309
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:18,240
It feels like he's in a much more

2310
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:19,776
Comfortable space just because

2311
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,568
He feels like he's getting dressed out

2312
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,152
But he's a man who's used to having people telling me did a bad job

2313
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,944
And right now he's like

2314
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:33,344
Yeah you're right man I didn't do a bad job like I feel comfortable here I'm not being questioned to think about things right now

2315
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:36,928
Possibly in other circumstances in his life is dressing down

2316
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:43,328
Don't really lead any consequences and then he gets a bonus at some point

2317
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:48,192
I'll do better next time

2318
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,240
It relies on some assumptions

2319
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:56,640
We can at least say there is something of value in him recognizing the what he did

2320
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,408
Was wrong

2321
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:03,808
Woodland something and low bar at forthrightness is not necessarily there in a lot of other Infowars personality

2322
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
StorQuest

2323
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:07,904
Again

2324
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,928
Tentatively

2325
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:14,048
Also the question of commie comes up a communist

2326
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:19,168
And support for this is a much better but it has to do

2327
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:21,728
With a text that Alex

2328
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,800
Your other headline said that he was a communist

2329
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,848
You got that from the picture of my

2330
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:27,872
Correct

2331
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,408
That was my understanding that the

2332
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:32,224
You don't have any other there was no other information

2333
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,248
And you had

2334
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:36,320
Leading anyone to believe that

2335
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:37,856
Before shooter

2336
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,392
Supported communism

2337
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:43,232
Well dones back during the Las Vegas shooting

2338
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,280
Show me a text from 1

2339
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
His sources

2340
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:49,120
Somehow tied the FBI hostage rescue

2341
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,144
Fingerhut shooting

2342
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:51,680
That said

2343
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:54,240
If there was a bunch of antifa paraphernalia

2344
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:55,264
All over the road

2345
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,032
Hotel room

2346
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,872
So that kind of got me into that line

2347
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:07,552
So now just anytime anyone fires a weapon off near you you just immediately look for something that looks antifa like

2348
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:08,576
That was what the source said

2349
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:10,368
Okay what is that have anything to do with this.

2350
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,416
That just kind of put me in the mindset

2351
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:14,464
So you're brainwashed by mr. Jones

2352
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,744
I want that was brainwashed

2353
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,280
Sounds like you

2354
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:19,328
He showed you something from a source

2355
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:23,936
And from there on out you were in a mindset to assume and look for antonym

2356
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,240
Well I wasn't going to

2357
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,288
Discluded

2358
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:34,176
What am I going to

2359
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:40,576
Possibility based on this text that Alex showed of an alleged source

2360
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:47,232
Okay still is this or Setters antifa and obviously I called them, what don't you understand

2361
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:52,096
The Source said that there was a People literature

2362
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:58,496
Prior to this on a different device

2363
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:04,640
Stablish talking point within the world of it

2364
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:09,248
Between things where there is no actual connection and build the Grandeur conspiracy

2365
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:11,552
So understand this

2366
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:14,880
Clearly I don't think so but I do think there is some

2367
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:17,952
Subconscious understanding

2368
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:24,352
You can Keaton that's the stuff that I think is being kind of revealed through the questioning

2369
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:27,168
Just decide to answer questions you didn't need to

2370
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:34,592
This leads to the actual discussion of the Fontaine photo that kit included in his

2371
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:35,616
Article

2372
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:40,992
And in the in the picture it's Marcel holding up his fist

2373
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:43,296
And he's wearing a shirt that if you

2374
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,832
Don't pay attention to it

2375
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:48,672
Might look like a communist shirt but it is revealed

2376
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:52,000
I imagine this next with what shirt actually is

2377
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:54,304
What does antifa stand for

2378
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:56,096
Anti-fascist

2379
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:56,864
I think

2380
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,632
Okay

2381
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,400
What

2382
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:01,472
Does everybody that's an antifa support communism

2383
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:05,312
I don't know you didn't put anything about antiphon your story did you

2384
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:12,224
Did the photo of mr. Fontaine

2385
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,064
If I remember correctly look like a communist shirt

2386
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:17,088
Put the pages

2387
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:21,184
Superman a communist shirt

2388
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:23,232
If you look closely

2389
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,024
Do you recognize that shardas

2390
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,048
Aperitif

2391
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:27,840
On the Communist Party

2392
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:31,168
We're certain communist individuals that are famous

2393
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:38,080
Are having a party for instance linen has a lampshade on his head in people are drinking

2394
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:44,480
Realize that no I did not feed just saw a red shirt with a swap with the hammer and sickle and you said got to be

2395
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,248
Communism

2396
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:49,088
That was my assumption of the time especially considering his

2397
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,904
This like that

2398
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:55,744
Is somebody raising their fists like this has that been

2399
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:58,048
Used for any other

2400
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:58,816
Movements

2401
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:03,680
Possibly fit in this photo that combines where I see a red shirt with the hammer and sickle

2402
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,472
Bam Kabhi communist

2403
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,240
I'm in your eyes

2404
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,032
Well I was my assumption that

2405
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
It looks like something

2406
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,360
Okay

2407
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:15,456
In the headline it doesn't say

2408
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:18,016
My assumption is that he might be communist

2409
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:20,832
Did you say that

2410
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:22,112
No sure didn't

2411
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:28,512
Kind of have these fundamental claims that Kate was leading with the

2412
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:34,656
Dress like an Isis fighter in Syria supported Isis was a commie

2413
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:37,216
Based on the flimsiest

2414
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:44,896
The evidence is actually contradictory to the claims that the opposite conclusion

2415
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:47,456
Or at least the absence of a conclusion

2416
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:51,040
I think that's pretty clearly demonstrated

2417
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,576
And so Bill asks

2418
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:54,368
How do you think you did on this one

2419
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,648
1 out of 10

2420
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:57,952
Rate your performance on this article

2421
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:01,024
What about two or three really you got the two

2422
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,328
What part of it was Dutchman to

2423
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:07,424
Everything you said if I had this to do all over again I want it done it this way

2424
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:11,776
Frankly I think this is my one of my worst performing articles I've ever done

2425
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:13,312
Veneto probably

2426
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:19,968
What's interesting about this cuz I had to listen to that a couple times

2427
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:25,600
Right how do you give yourself a rank he says two or three I bill as shocked

2428
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,928
It can't interpret that is how did you get down to two

2429
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:34,048
How did you get down to it supposed to what deserves it never occurred to him

2430
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:41,216
Looking for me to justify why it's better than 200

2431
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:44,800
Wish I wish I could listen to this episode

2432
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:49,408
With zero understand it was Zero contacts for Infowars or anything

2433
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:51,968
Just the idea of listening to somebody

2434
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,248
Go like

2435
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:55,808
Oh I called him a communist need like you realize

2436
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:57,088
That the shirt

2437
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,904
Had Lennon wearing a lampshade on it right

2438
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:06,304
Just that moment like this is really happening this is not fake

2439
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:12,448
You withdraw that Infowars based on it with all the other stuff we know

2440
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,984
Cross positively

2441
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:15,520
So

2442
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:18,592
Marcel's face is the only one that

2443
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:22,688
Visible Ryan the pictures that kids put into the article

2444
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:29,344
And that that's a problem because if you're looking at the article you would maybe assume that it's the same face

2445
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:34,976
Under those masks better on the Instagram account at play

2446
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:38,304
You would agree with me that in exhibit 1

2447
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:42,144
Yes the only photograph of the alleged shooter

2448
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:46,240
With that is the only photograph with an unobscured face

2449
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,008
Is

2450
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,032
Mr. font

2451
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,056
Yes

2452
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:53,408
So when you started spreading photos of the shooter

2453
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:55,456
Only one that anyone can see your face

2454
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,992
Isn't even the right person

2455
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,016
Crept

2456
02:09:58,272 --> 02:10:00,320
Did you do you know what a reverse image

2457
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,624
Familiar with it

2458
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,392
Okay

2459
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
Did you do what

2460
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:07,488
I remember typing it'll Nikolas Cruz

2461
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,024
On Google Images

2462
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:13,376
And unfortunately the photos that were coming up for of Mister Fontaine

2463
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:14,912
I didn't ask

2464
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:18,240
I know I'm just that's just making me clarifying

2465
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:19,520
I asked you

2466
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:21,056
Whether or not you did a reversal

2467
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:22,080
I don't remember

2468
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:24,384
And answers

2469
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:28,224
So that's for practice probably

2470
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:34,624
One of the things of this deposition is that there's

2471
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:41,024
There's a kind of nonlinear aspect of the questions that are at the registration

2472
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,328
And then came back up

2473
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:46,656
I'm here the notion of Journalism comes back up

2474
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:47,936
Can boost

2475
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:54,848
Unfortunately kid has referred to himself as a video journalist introduces an entirely

2476
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:59,200
Play new wrinkle of your declaration in front of you

2477
02:10:59,456 --> 02:10:59,968
Yes

2478
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:04,064
We look at

2479
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,088
Paragraph

2480
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:07,136
2

2481
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,952
Says you're a video journalist

2482
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:11,744
And you use the term Journal

2483
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,024
Video Journal

2484
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:15,328
Journalist oh is he

2485
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,632
In the context of video Journal

2486
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:18,656
Cracked

2487
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,984
What's the difference between regular journalism in video journalism

2488
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:26,336
I use the term video journalist because I really don't know how to describe myself

2489
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:32,480
To the best of my ability as far as going out and shooting videos interviewing people

2490
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,784
And then writing stories about the videos

2491
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,832
I didn't do that very often if at all

2492
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:42,208
Okay so you just shoot videos and then give them to somebody else. You videos uploaded website

2493
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:45,280
You wouldn't write anything in the bottom or a story of with

2494
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:47,072
With the video typically not

2495
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,424
I never I generally never had time to I was just shoot a video when just uploaded

2496
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,728
Open YouTube and then we didn't bet it on a force

2497
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:54,752
Yes Evening News

2498
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:57,312
Albino

2499
02:11:58,592 --> 02:12:00,384
I mean normally in the company we use

2500
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,944
Praise reporter for the on-air Talent

2501
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:06,016
Private

2502
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:08,576
Muir

2503
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:11,648
Taking videos doing interviews and uploading

2504
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,440
Crack

2505
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,208
Yes

2506
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:16,256
So when you see news cameras out

2507
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,560
In the field and their little bands

2508
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:20,352
Can I pull over and set up the camera

2509
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:21,632
Do an interview

2510
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:24,704
There's nothing different from that way

2511
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:27,264
Well they had a lot more equipment and Ativan

2512
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,288
That's fine

2513
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,568
You don't have a van

2514
02:12:29,824 --> 02:12:32,384
Or the equipment but you got a camera near the mouth correct

2515
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:36,480
Yeah but unfortunately there's a lot of interviews I couldn't do because it seems like

2516
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:38,528
When you have a small camera people think

2517
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,576
All time

2518
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:43,136
Why are you telling me this

2519
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,672
What are you doing

2520
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:50,816
Kid goddamn splitting hairs but the definitions is so weird

2521
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:52,096
What are you doing

2522
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:56,704
What are you well you know I mean sure I do all the things

2523
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:57,472
But

2524
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:58,496
Am I

2525
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:04,896
I do I do everything that's exactly the same as described as journalists except

2526
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:11,296
By using iPhone

2527
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:18,208
Pandora's 50 million dollars in that we can't afford impressive cameras in a van on a tank

2528
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:26,656
Justifies his use of the image of Marcel that he uses by

2529
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:27,680
Claiming that

2530
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:29,984
Quote the image was trending

2531
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:34,080
Bossy is trending

2532
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:36,896
No problem but you look at reality

2533
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:38,432
You turn the page to page

2534
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,224
Paragraph 3

2535
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:49,952
It says I published an image of a man that I had a obtained from the popular image

2536
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,488
In web board entitled

2537
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:52,256
4chan

2538
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:58,400
I went to the fortune website after I had seen

2539
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:02,240
The challenged image trending on social media

2540
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,032
Yes

2541
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:05,824
How does

2542
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,872
How does an image

2543
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:11,456
When you see it all well when you go on watch

2544
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:14,528
Twitter news feed I need to see it all over the place

2545
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,808
Raven maybe your face

2546
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:18,880
Everywhere

2547
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:22,976
An under oath right now to this jury or telling them that you saw

2548
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,768
Mister fontaine's photo

2549
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,048
All over

2550
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:26,816
Your news

2551
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:29,376
That's my understanding if I recall correctly

2552
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:37,824
Do you know how many times at the time the article was published you know how many times how many times that image has been posted on

2553
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:39,104
No

2554
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:40,896
Do you know how many times you can post on Facebook

2555
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:43,712
Would it surprise you a lot

2556
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:44,480
Yeah

2557
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:45,760
Less than

2558
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:49,344
What time frame

2559
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,624
Between

2560
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:53,696
The shooting and your articles online

2561
02:14:58,304 --> 02:14:59,584
Big cup of water

2562
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:01,120
Well maybe I'm

2563
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:02,912
Maybe I just happened to see all of them

2564
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:09,312
Good sayings

2565
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:18,272
Maybe you just don't have as many cool friends as I do

2566
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,040
That's

2567
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:26,976
The justification is in kits

2568
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:33,376
Includes a image of somebody posting this picture of Marcel

2569
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:37,472
Sell on Twitter prior to keep putting out the article

2570
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:42,336
And this also reveals

2571
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:48,736
No but it is what turns out to be a troll Twitter account and

2572
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:50,784
Conversation of this we learn another

2573
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,552
Gap

2574
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,320
In kids

2575
02:15:52,576 --> 02:15:54,112
Information base that is

2576
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:55,136
Truly staggering

2577
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:58,720
In paragraph three of your declaration

2578
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:00,768
You also talk about

2579
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:03,072
Laguna Beach antifa

2580
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:06,144
You see that

2581
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:09,216
You relied

2582
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:12,032
On Laguna Beach antifas Tweet correct

2583
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:15,104
No would it surprise you to know that it was the

2584
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,640
Only original Source at the

2585
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:18,176
The time that I posted it

2586
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:18,944
In all others that

2587
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,808
That would surprise me

2588
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:30,976
Now that we've established that

2589
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:34,816
Your testimony

2590
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:36,864
And this affidavit is that

2591
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,656
The Laguna Beach

2592
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,192
Antifa

2593
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,264
Twitter post was at 2:37 p.m.

2594
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,056
Hours before I post it

2595
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:47,616
The challenged image on the Infowars website

2596
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,152
Yes

2597
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:52,224
2:37 p.m. what time zone

2598
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:55,040
I believe that be Central Time why would you think that

2599
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,576
Because of the time zone on men

2600
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:59,904
Wouldn't surprise you to know that if you go to the Laguna Beach page

2601
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:04,000
California

2602
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,840
I was in the impression to Route Florida

2603
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:14,752
Would it surprise you think Laguna Beach

2604
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:21,152
Wow Laguna Beach Florida

2605
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:28,832
Oh my God these are unforced errors in trying to

2606
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:31,392
Explain himself he reveals these

2607
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:33,440
Just remarkable

2608
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:36,256
Misconceptions

2609
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,280
Betty has

2610
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:40,864
Allah Akbar is something that only Isis people say

2611
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:43,680
Distler isn't a slur

2612
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:45,984
Laguna beaches in Florida

2613
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,264
It's it's

2614
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:53,664
Is sad it feels like if you are going to prepare kit Daniels for this deposition

2615
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:59,552
You have to be as oddware one as honest as any human being has ever been and just start with

2616
02:18:00,064 --> 02:18:05,952
They know the true answers to the questions they're going to ask you so your instinct

2617
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:07,744
Is going to be wrong

2618
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:14,144
Yes you do not know the true answers or what they're answering you

2619
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:20,800
Do any answer you have is only bad for us there's a human impulse to explain yourself

2620
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:23,872
You want to be friends you want to explain don't listen

2621
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:26,944
Let me explain why you don't feel like what I did was bad

2622
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:34,368
Just don't do that I guess a good way to prep him we'll just be like watch every episode of Law & Order

2623
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:40,768
I mean a good way to prep him is like a f****** Mafia prep where he wakes up in a goddamn

2624
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:44,096
River prep you need to do for this

2625
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:49,728
It's it's just I don't know what you would do like

2626
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:56,384
You'd have to deal with so many like just first concept absolutely in order to be like you can handle

2627
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:59,200
Being cross-examined by somebody

2628
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:02,016
Some things are

2629
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:09,952
Aren't alright let's start from the beginning

2630
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:12,512
Apparently was pretty new

2631
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:16,352
It is a troll account

2632
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:20,192
Might have been discreet might have been

2633
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:25,312
Pretty fresh webkit God's hands on it what time did you post the article

2634
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:28,896
It was approximately

2635
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,200
4 p.m. or after

2636
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:32,736
Till about 23 minutes

2637
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:35,808
Any been up on Laguna Beach antifas page

2638
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:36,576
423

2639
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:43,744
How long have you been following Laguna Beach antiphon Twitter I wasn't following them on Twitter how did you get to it I did not

2640
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,560
What you doing in your affidavit

2641
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:48,608
So Kevin Brown

2642
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:52,960
Went and found an example of fontaine's photo on silk

2643
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:53,728
Media

2644
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:55,264
Dab

2645
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:56,288
Predated

2646
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:57,824
When I put it up on Infowars

2647
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,640
Why don't you just go get the original

2648
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,944
I didn't remember I couldn't find the original

2649
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:03,712
Fortunately

2650
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:04,992
How long did you look

2651
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,528
Fufu

2652
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:07,552
40 minutes

2653
02:20:07,808 --> 02:20:08,320
That's it

2654
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:10,368
Call mingle maybe longer

2655
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:14,720
Maybe it was well I couldn't find I went back and looked at the

2656
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:18,560
44 I screenshot it for Fortune I cannot find the bread

2657
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:21,888
I did I do remember looking for it on social media and

2658
02:20:22,144 --> 02:20:23,424
Fortune log before deleting it

2659
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:24,448
But I was looking

2660
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,008
Discovery process

2661
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:28,800
Why were they deleting

2662
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:29,824
I don't know

2663
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:31,872
Possibly yes

2664
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,432
Or because

2665
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:37,248
There were a bunch of Twitter pages set up quickly

2666
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,600
Call pages to see if any news media Outlet

2667
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:42,880
Would pick it up and run the store

2668
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:46,208
That's a possibility

2669
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,512
Do you believe your victim of

2670
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:53,376
Some internet trolls that just got the best of you cuz you weren't paying attention I think I was duped definitely

2671
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:54,400
I think you were too

2672
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:00,032
I love

2673
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,872
That he instantly responded with what he thought

2674
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:10,272
With a solid amount of research time to 40 minutes and when he was questioned on that immediate

2675
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:11,040
He was like

2676
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:17,440
Maybe it was longer I didn't know supposed to be longer wasn't supposed to be longer but like 30 minutes

2677
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:22,560
If you had that would be a reasonable amount of time to have

2678
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:28,960
That seems like about how long it might take about that long to find you failed to find it then we're in trouble

2679
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:32,032
Pretty pretty easily

2680
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:33,568
Oh well

2681
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,920
So now we can explore this notion of

2682
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,968
Alex told him

2683
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:40,992
About

2684
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:44,576
The antifa literature at the Las Vegas shooting

2685
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:50,976
So this antifa idea is connected to this shooting somehow which then has been translated into communism

2686
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:52,000
Which makes sense

2687
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:53,792
2K

2688
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,584
And this is why

2689
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:58,656
The only thing you got from his photo was that he

2690
02:21:59,168 --> 02:22:04,288
We eating even understand the T-shirt he was wearing what motivation did you add to the story with

2691
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,824
Wells Fargo

2692
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:08,128
T-shirt he's wearing looking at it

2693
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,944
Hammer and sickle is red color

2694
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,736
At the time I couldn't tell us a t-shirt

2695
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,528
What

2696
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:21,184
What did that what did his photo editors

2697
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:24,512
Well like I said

2698
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:29,376
I was told in a Las Vegas shooting that there was

2699
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:32,448
Antifa paraphernalia all over the shooters room

2700
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:35,008
I got meat in the mindset to consider

2701
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:36,288
Bad

2702
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:37,056
There might be some

2703
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:39,104
I'm sort of communist antifa

2704
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,152
Link

2705
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:42,688
Tucson police shooting

2706
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:48,320
Okay

2707
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:50,368
What did Mr fontanes photo

2708
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:51,392
Add to the article

2709
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:54,976
I thought it was a photo of Nikolas Cruz at the time

2710
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:57,280
And you believe that everyone in antifa

2711
02:22:57,536 --> 02:22:58,560
Support communism

2712
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:03,424
How to get to Oso hammer-and-sickle and it was red

2713
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:09,824
Want to say hammer hammer and sickle in a red shirt I think,

2714
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:11,872
Okay how do you get to Aunt

2715
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:12,896
What's that

2716
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:16,224
How many different combinations of Santa Claus

2717
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,248
About to Las Vegas

2718
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:20,832
Alex Jones is the reason why you assumed

2719
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,112
Everyone in antifa

2720
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:24,160
Support communism I never said that

2721
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,208
You

2722
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:29,024
You added the picture Mister Fontaine

2723
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,304
Because

2724
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,840
Yeah communism shirt on

2725
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:32,864
In your eyes

2726
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:33,632
Yes

2727
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:35,680
You added that

2728
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:36,704
Because

2729
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,984
Mr. Jones

2730
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:42,080
Showed you some information that led you to believe there might be

2731
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:43,616
Antifer

2732
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:44,640
Related

2733
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:48,480
Ideology behind the shooting

2734
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:53,088
How do you get from communism with mister Fontaine shirt

2735
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:54,624
To him being antifa

2736
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:56,928
It's in the same Spectrum politically

2737
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:58,720
Of what

2738
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:02,304
I mean pantifa tip is typically left-leaning communism

2739
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:08,448
That's how you got to the headline of your story

2740
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:10,752
Guess

2741
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:12,800
Swinging a mess

2742
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:14,080
Man

2743
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:20,480
If you don't they're both left-leaning feel like it Daniel should really just be going like dude you are blowing my

2744
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:24,832
My mind what are you saying I'm saying that antifa and communism

2745
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:30,208
And you're like have you thought about it and I realizing that I have not

2746
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:33,792
Write the end this leads to a line of questioning about like

2747
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:40,192
Now what about that why did you why did you blame Obama he is also left

2748
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:47,616
That's the trouble in the ass to go down

2749
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:54,016
Reverse image search because obviously this is leading to information that bill already has

2750
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:56,064
Of what he would have found

2751
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,368
Have you done a reverse image search

2752
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,392
When did you

2753
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:02,720
When did you learn what a reverse image search was

2754
02:25:02,976 --> 02:25:04,000
I don't remember in Fort

2755
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:05,536
Okay was it

2756
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:09,888
Just now six months ago 6 years ago I don't remember

2757
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,424
Have you known about it for a while

2758
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:12,960
Say so

2759
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,728
Okay

2760
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,520
And

2761
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:18,592
Have you run one on this image

2762
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:19,872
I don't remember

2763
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,944
Standing here today have you run whenever

2764
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:25,504
I've done in the past yes

2765
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,528
On this image

2766
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:28,064
On Fontaine image

2767
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:28,832
I don't remember

2768
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:29,600
Okay

2769
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,904
It's not hard to do right

2770
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:35,232
How do you do a reverse image

2771
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:39,328
Oh no,

2772
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:41,376
Sometimes I try to use Google

2773
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:44,192
Both of those you just copy and play

2774
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,264
Yeah I was Google

2775
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:48,288
Cancel

2776
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:51,104
Regardless it's not hard

2777
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:53,408
Rice

2778
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:56,736
And standing here today did you know that if you do reverse image search

2779
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:59,040
You'll find mr. fontaine's photo

2780
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:00,064
The exact

2781
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:01,856
With the exact same

2782
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,648
Commentary the bottom

2783
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:04,672
Posted

2784
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:06,464
More days before the shooting ever had

2785
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,768
No

2786
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:11,328
Unimportant facts right

2787
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:15,424
Especially if you could have done reverse image search

2788
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,472
For spreading his photograph all over

2789
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,240
WeatherNation

2790
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:19,776
Alleging to be a master

2791
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:36,928
You are blowing my mind man what are you saying reverse image search before I post

2792
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:41,792
Why are there

2793
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:44,608
That is the first time it ever occurred to him

2794
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:47,168
To have done that before posting

2795
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:51,008
I don't know about that bass Ardex also

2796
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:57,408
Never is that noise been more appropriate

2797
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:59,712
He never thought about the idea of of

2798
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:03,808
Reverse image searching before unfortunately

2799
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:07,136
Plaintiffs attorneys are they have at their disposal

2800
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:10,464
Skip previous work

2801
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,744
I vaguely remember riding

2802
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:13,024
Okay

2803
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,328
In this article

2804
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,608
You talk about

2805
02:27:17,376 --> 02:27:19,168
How Reckless it is for people

2806
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:25,824
Cannot run reverse image search is don't you

2807
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:29,408
Articles dated November 5th 2016

2808
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:32,224
Correct

2809
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:34,528
Yes

2810
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:36,320
And that's

2811
02:27:36,832 --> 02:27:41,696
Over a year before you did Republic Mister fontaine's photographs the world

2812
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:45,792
And the headline says law enforcement begs world

2813
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:52,704
Read Hillary's emails Hillary emails to find child rape evidence and then it says

2814
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:53,472
Hillary linked

2815
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:57,568
Child sex ring, emails suggest

2816
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:58,336
Yes

2817
02:27:59,104 --> 02:27:59,616
Okay

2818
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:01,152
We flipped a page 8

2819
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:07,296
Does the seller attached a picture of a Beanie Baby collection to the email but

2820
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:09,600
Using a reverse image search

2821
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:15,232
The image appeared to be a publicly-available photo that appeared on several blogs as far back

2822
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:19,072
It's October 2014 and perhaps even earlier

2823
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:22,144
The sellers email was dated June two thousand

2824
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,424
I read that correctly

2825
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:27,008
So you knew what a reversion research was at the time yes

2826
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:28,032
You done

2827
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:30,592
Before you posted mr. fontaine's photo to the world

2828
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,384
Why didn't you do 1

2829
02:28:32,896 --> 02:28:33,920
I don't remember but

2830
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:37,504
If I didn't do it

2831
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,808
Vermont and photo or Greta not doing

2832
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:44,672
Something so

2833
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:48,256
Satisfying I guess because he works for Infowars about that like

2834
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:53,888
You didn't do reverse temperature tonight

2835
02:28:54,656 --> 02:29:00,800
Also here's a article where you're scolding people for not doing the reverse image search it feels

2836
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:01,568
Like

2837
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,360
A constant

2838
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:06,944
Add repetition of that jackass

2839
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,224
Sketch

2840
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:14,624
Wait where they have the giant hand pneumatic or the the drinks

2841
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:20,512
So whatever he's just walking right into question she's just like

2842
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:26,912
He had he knows that the thing he's answering after that is you know you wrote this article right

2843
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:31,776
He doesn't seem to ever realize the hands comic

2844
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:32,800
No clue it's

2845
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:39,200
Every single time except trouble and they walked toward that door with all those drinks and it gets smashed

2846
02:29:39,456 --> 02:29:39,968
By the hand of God

2847
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:45,856
Yeah because this reverse image search article that kit has written about

2848
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:52,256
Something to do with the podesta emails and Clinton has been brought up right now kits pizzagate cover

2849
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:58,656
Here we go

2850
02:29:58,912 --> 02:29:59,936
Under the bus

2851
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:03,008
The next page page 9

2852
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:04,800
The second full paragraph

2853
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:11,200
His other strange email sent to podesta include cryptic references to Pita hot dogs

2854
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:12,736
Pasta and walnuts

2855
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:18,112
Which are fueling speculation they are code words for criminal activity including child molester

2856
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:18,880
I read that correctly

2857
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:21,184
This is a bunch of pizzagate

2858
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:22,720
That's right

2859
02:30:23,232 --> 02:30:25,024
I don't know if this was necessarily

2860
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:26,304
Involve

2861
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:27,072
Pizzagate

2862
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:27,840
Oh yeah

2863
02:30:28,096 --> 02:30:31,168
My other channel pizzagate had to do with the Comet Ping Pong Pizza

2864
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,984
Right where did all that start

2865
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:42,176
Guess the emails with cryptic references about pizza and child molestation you know that right

2866
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:46,528
I know it wasn't that I wasn't involved with the connestee Falls too far as I remember

2867
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:52,672
Yet you wrote an article about linking Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring

2868
02:30:55,488 --> 02:31:01,120
If I remember correctly I think Alex Jones give me the headline in the sub headline for this article

2869
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:03,936
I think I worked with it

2870
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:06,496
Okay I don't remember unfortunately

2871
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:12,384
One thing we do know is that here you are again writing about a story that turned out

2872
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:15,200
To not only not be true but people acted on

2873
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:16,736
Right

2874
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:17,760
What are you referring to

2875
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:24,160
A gentleman with an ass with an AR-15 walking into a pizzeria firing his weapon because he was

2876
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:24,928
Convince

2877
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:26,976
There was a child sex ring being run out of

2878
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:29,024
Can I say anything about a pizza

2879
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,560
Pizzeria on this article

2880
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:35,424
Beautiful I'm saying you're reporting on the information that led to that Pizzeria

2881
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:40,800
Pretty sure about that the name of that Pizzeria

2882
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:43,104
I have no idea destiny

2883
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:47,200
I like I said I didn't I wasn't that involved with the comet

2884
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:52,064
Jean-Paul stuff at all no but you were involved with spreading the disinformation about

2885
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:55,904
These non cryptic messages what does the emails true

2886
02:31:56,160 --> 02:32:01,280
It was Alex Jones that told me that pizza hot dogs pasta walnuts Raw codewords

2887
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:04,352
And I and I believe that was also FBI

2888
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:05,888
Symbolism

2889
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,168
Can you believe it

2890
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:08,704
Fatburger child molestation

2891
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:09,984
Do you still believe that

2892
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:11,008
I don't know I was just

2893
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:11,776
Stuyvesant

2894
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:17,152
Trying to vaguely remember what it this is from 20/16 my memory little bit fuzzy would you believe that

2895
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:18,688
The FBI had coworx

2896
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:21,504
Like that for Chop

2897
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:24,576
Would point out hey if you ever hear these code words

2898
02:32:25,088 --> 02:32:26,112
This could be

2899
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,392
A

2900
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:31,232
Signal for child molestation so be on the lookout for it.

2901
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:34,816
It was an I believe is in a bulletin FBI Bulletin

2902
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,352
Do you

2903
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:40,192
That's what I remember. Are you sure that what you're referring to is

2904
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:41,728
Actual real FBI.

2905
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:44,032
I vaguely remember seeing one

2906
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:45,312
Vaguely

2907
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:51,712
But like a Galaxy

2908
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:58,112
I can't you know this is going to be Alex

2909
02:32:58,368 --> 02:32:59,648
Yeah that's bad

2910
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:06,048
I can't believe he hasn't already how far into the depth is where at least an hour into the deposition but

2911
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:12,448
I can't believe he hasn't already realize that if he gets the question do you think that was

2912
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:16,288
The real document she knows the answer to that already sure

2913
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:19,616
Like he doesn't heat kit just can't process that

2914
02:33:19,872 --> 02:33:22,944
He thinks that anybody asking him a question

2915
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:29,344
Is genuinely interested in his response to it or there's a possibility that based on your answer.

2916
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:32,928
The information the other person has will be affected

2917
02:33:33,696 --> 02:33:39,328
I mean it's optimistic in some ways it is it's it's a little Don Quijote it is

2918
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:44,192
It is a Panza

2919
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:49,568
It's a good approach to take care of would be

2920
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:52,384
What have you ever gotten right

2921
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:53,920
Good call Bill

2922
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:56,224
Unfortunately I watched a lot

2923
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:59,552
Looking for work program I think I've read every word that you've ever

2924
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:02,624
So what I'm asking you these stories I kind of know what

2925
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:03,648
Dancers are

2926
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:05,952
So what else have you gotten right

2927
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:12,096
And I'll give you two

2928
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:15,168
Epstein instant jussie Smollett

2929
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:17,984
I'll give you those two guesses that y'all end up getting right

2930
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,008
What else

2931
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:22,080
We are

2932
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:25,408
I think they're just so many of them

2933
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:26,432
So many

2934
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:27,712
I'll wait

2935
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:31,808
31

2936
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,904
The Gulf of Tonkin doesn't count y'all weren't company when it happen

2937
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:42,048
Priceisright.com doesn't count they want to company when it happened

2938
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,936
I want that on the record please

2939
02:34:52,544 --> 02:34:58,688
We can sit in this awkward silence as long as you need to think of one time where y'all were right while they're just so many like stories we've covered

2940
02:34:58,944 --> 02:35:05,088
Over the years as little bit hard for me to kind of

2941
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:10,208
It's like it's kind of like on Spotify like the time. You here

2942
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:12,000
You keep thinking

2943
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,280
Will wait in silence

2944
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:16,608
That's not

2945
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:26,080
Come on come on just let me get out of this one just let me get out of this what there's so many nothing but time just let me get out of this

2946
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:32,480
All your questions sir I'll get on my knees just don't make me answers anything I've ever written is true

2947
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:37,856
It's an embarrassment of correctness and so I have too much to choose from

2948
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:41,184
I think the reality of that is obviously

2949
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:46,816
You'd be very worried about saying anything definitive late cuz there will be a follow-up question

2950
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:49,376
Really back up with your delay probably

2951
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:50,912
So

2952
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:54,496
This is this is another moment of kid being like

2953
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:56,544
A normal human sort of

2954
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:59,104
And that is supposed to have

2955
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:03,456
Do you believe that you and Infowars are responsible

2956
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:05,248
For the coverage that you

2957
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:07,296
Put out that affected my

2958
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:12,672
Write like a normal human accept that responsibility

2959
02:36:12,928 --> 02:36:14,720
You and or Infowars

2960
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:17,024
Share responsibility

2961
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:18,304
What mistress

2962
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:21,376
Regret

2963
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:23,168
Ocean has photo on

2964
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:25,472
I do not see how you felt

2965
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,032
If you're going to

2966
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:30,336
Hold yourself in the company responsible

2967
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,128
Yes

2968
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,224
In

2969
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:38,016
That goes for both you and the come

2970
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:38,784
Chris

2971
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,856
Are you aware that the company does

2972
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:45,952
No I'm not aware

2973
02:36:46,464 --> 02:36:46,976
You disagree

2974
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:55,936
I know cooking position are

2975
02:36:56,192 --> 02:36:57,472
And I can call off strike

2976
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:06,432
Stuff even bill at this point is throwing a lesson we already know the answers yet

2977
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,200
Trying to help him out

2978
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:13,600
He's not hitting as hard as he probably could really do feel like Bill is is like

2979
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:14,880
Giving him

2980
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:16,160
This dislike

2981
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:17,440
I don't know what to call it

2982
02:37:18,208 --> 02:37:20,000
Just a sense of like man

2983
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:26,912
I could really tear your ass into shreds you know that right it comes back

2984
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:31,264
Back to the think the dynamic you were talking about at the beginning is just as feeling of

2985
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:32,288
They're just

2986
02:37:32,544 --> 02:37:36,384
Do you say things that you don't need to say in response to questions that you could

2987
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:42,784
Do not answer you offer more information

2988
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,576
Boxing metaphor it would be like

2989
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:49,952
You are leaving your midsection exposed Christ Italy

2990
02:37:50,464 --> 02:37:54,560
You got your hands over your head and you're saying I'm going to get you

2991
02:37:55,072 --> 02:38:01,216
So this next clip is where of the main headline surrounding

2992
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:04,032
This deposition is dead kid started crying

2993
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:07,104
And this is the Clipper that happens

2994
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:07,872
And

2995
02:38:08,128 --> 02:38:12,992
I'm going to give a little bit of just a warning in advance there's some language of the two used

2996
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:14,016
Regarding

2997
02:38:14,272 --> 02:38:19,904
Fontaine that comes from 4chan post

2998
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:21,696
And just for the sake of

2999
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:26,048
It's on the record right here is that

3000
02:38:26,304 --> 02:38:30,400
I'm going to go ahead and assume you've never seen this February 10th post

3001
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:31,424
From fortunate

3002
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:32,192
No

3003
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,240
Okay you flip the page

3004
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:35,008
3

3005
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:35,776
Yes

3006
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:37,312
What do we see

3007
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:38,848
Photo Mister Fontaine

3008
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:40,384
That's four days

3009
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:42,688
Correct

3010
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:44,224
So

3011
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,248
This post

3012
02:38:46,272 --> 02:38:48,064
Is if you go to the first page

3013
02:38:49,088 --> 02:38:50,624
Is a sub page of 4chan

3014
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,416
And called Politically Incorrect right

3015
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:53,696
I believe so again

3016
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:54,976
And the caption

3017
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:56,768
Of this thread is

3018
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:58,816
Antifa

3019
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,608
Aspie

3020
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:01,376
Lefty

3021
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,144
Communist

3022
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,168
Cringe thread

3023
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:05,472

Unironically Lefty dimwit

3025
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:08,800
Commies

3026
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:09,568
Etc

3027
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:12,384
You found while surfing the internet social media

3028
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:13,408
Okay

3029
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:17,760
And you understand Mister Fontaine was posted by someone to this

3030
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:21,600
It's what it appears that they are you aware that Miss

3031
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:22,368
Serfontein cell

3032
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:27,488
Would that affect the way you feel about him if he did

3033
02:39:28,256 --> 02:39:28,768
Yeah it was

3034
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:29,792
Felt the same way at 10

3035
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:33,888
I'm going to represent to you that Mr Fontaine has been clinically diagnosed

3036
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:35,936
The autism

3037
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:39,008
Cousin like

3038
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,288
He's socially

3039
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:41,568
Not very

3040
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:43,104
Developed as you are today

3041
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:45,664
And

3042
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:47,200
Has dealt with mental health

3043
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:48,480
Beforehand

3044
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:52,832
Now remember how you said you felt

3045
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,368
Whenever you got there

3046
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:56,928
Now

3047
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,464
I want you to imagine

3048
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,048
And you do not have any swimming pool

3049
02:40:02,816 --> 02:40:03,328
Is that you know of

3050
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:04,096
Knox

3051
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:05,120
Depression

3052
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:06,656
Okay have you suffered from

3053
02:40:06,912 --> 02:40:07,424
Autism

3054
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:09,216
Social anxiety

3055
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:11,520
Do you have

3056
02:40:12,032 --> 02:40:13,056
An inability to

3057
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:14,848
Working large

3058
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:16,896
And deal with a lot lot of

3059
02:40:19,712 --> 02:40:21,504
And you can sympathize a little bit more

3060
02:40:24,576 --> 02:40:25,344
And I understand your

3061
02:40:26,112 --> 02:40:27,648
And I'm not trying to

3062
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:42,240
Quite understand

3063
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:44,032
The suffering has been through

3064
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:49,664
I understand you're upset

3065
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:51,200
If you want to take a few seconds

3066
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,480
We live

3067
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:54,528
Yeah let's take a break and get him some tissues

3068
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:56,320
We got the record Madam reporter

3069
02:40:57,088 --> 02:40:57,600
30pm

3070
02:40:58,624 --> 02:41:04,768
So they go to break

3071
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:10,400
You do a plug for gato prevail

3072
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:11,424
It's important

3073
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:13,216
I think

3074
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:15,008
That a lot of people have

3075
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:17,824
Attention to this

3076
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:24,224
I think it's interesting obviously that he started crying but I also think that it's probably the most

3077
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:28,320
Human response to the information that he's being

3078
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:31,648
We presented with a guy I don't think that it's something

3079
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:34,464
Does maca worthy or anything I think that

3080
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:36,000
It shows

3081
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:42,656
Inability to empathize with somebody when forced to

3082
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:45,728
I think that obviously he should have

3083
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:49,312
Recognize the pain that he was causing through this

3084
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:54,432
Sloppy ass work short prior to this sure you would hope that right but

3085
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:59,040
I don't I still find it very difficult to criticize

3086
02:41:59,296 --> 02:42:01,856
That response

3087
02:42:02,112 --> 02:42:08,256
This is a really good example of what we've talked about from the very beginning

3088
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:14,656
With and with Alex it's kind of come to a clearer idea and flus ambiguous

3089
02:42:14,912 --> 02:42:17,472
That stupid V evil continue upright you know

3090
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:19,264
You can be stupid

3091
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:25,152
You know still do evil s*** but it's kind of clear here that kit Daniels is

3092
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:31,552
Not in the vindictive or malicious or he's a colonel of evil but mostly kind of drama

3093
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:34,624
Madonna where he's just kind of an idiot

3094
02:42:35,136 --> 02:42:40,512
I mean unless he's a f****** Kaiser so say level Mastermind right here

3095
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:43,328
Then he's kind of an idiot who is Ben

3096
02:42:43,584 --> 02:42:46,400
Like to play Alex Jones and intimidated by everybody else

3097
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:49,728
I don't I don't know what conclusion to draw but I think

3098
02:42:49,984 --> 02:42:53,312
You know that's certainly a fair reading that you can you can take

3099
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:56,896
I was really

3100
02:42:57,152 --> 02:43:02,528
I knew going in watching this and he started crying and I still felt that it was shocking

3101
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:03,296
Yeah like

3102
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:07,392
It was fate still shocked me because first of all it kind of happens fairly quick

3103
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:12,256
It does it doesn't seem to be pit doesn't

3104
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:18,912
What it felt like to me was somebody's dissonance really being challenged

3105
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:24,032
Mike be the notion that like this is what I do for a living and this is what

3106
02:43:24,288 --> 02:43:29,152
If I wasn't getting sued for this I probably wouldn't even recognize that I've done something wrong

3107
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:30,432
And here I am

3108
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,992
Seeing parts of myself

3109
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:37,600
In the victim of what I've done at these thoughts just sort of tearing

3110
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:40,416
Yeah it's in the brain

3111
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:46,048
I don't know it's hard to sleep

3112
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:49,632
The thing that it reminds me of most

3113
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:50,400
Is

3114
02:43:50,912 --> 02:43:52,448
Evangelical children

3115
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:54,496
And how they grow up

3116
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:55,264
And

3117
02:43:55,520 --> 02:44:00,640
One of the things that will almost always wind up happening with an Evangelical child leaves the faith

3118
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:02,944
For good is they will have

3119
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:06,272
A very big conversation and they will suddenly start crying

3120
02:44:06,528 --> 02:44:11,392
And they don't entirely know why I'm based upon the questions in the conversations in the thought they're having

3121
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:14,464
And the reality is the reason it happening is because

3122
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:19,072
They're going through this strange moment where everything they have ever believed

3123
02:44:19,328 --> 02:44:21,120
Comes into contact with a

3124
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:25,216
Muv immovable force your realities being challenged

3125
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:29,312
Minecrafting pressure from that and so you just always cry

3126
02:44:29,568 --> 02:44:30,592
I did just happen

3127
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:32,384
No conversely

3128
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:38,784
Deprogramming as well you have situations like the Daria deposition or Alex's

3129
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:39,552
Deposition

3130
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:41,600
Where they're being confronted with

3131
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:48,256
Like very incontrovertible instances of the harm and damage the game 2

3132
02:44:48,512 --> 02:44:51,072
Luby's the victims of these these narratives of these

3133
02:44:51,328 --> 02:44:52,608
These things that they put out

3134
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:56,704
And they did not bat an eyelash

3135
02:44:57,216 --> 02:44:59,008
They had no real

3136
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:01,312
Alex gave lip service to like

3137
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:07,712
Example of the emails that Wolfgang halbig sent harassing the charity

3138
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:13,088
Southern Voice

3139
02:45:13,344 --> 02:45:15,904
And end with Dario's even worse and Calder

3140
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:17,440
High School

3141
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:24,864
This this feels like there's some human hair that's crying out

3142
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:29,984
Because it appeared feels like the difference between a Believer and somebody who is raised in the church

3143
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:36,384
You know it's like somebody who is raised in the church has been surrounded by nothing but this type of information

3144
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:37,920
Haitian for such a long time

3145
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:40,736
32 Tsum to be true

3146
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:47,136
Believers it doesn't matter what you do it does not matter what you do you cannot talk to them in a way that

3147
02:45:47,392 --> 02:45:48,928
Will cut through their belief system

3148
02:45:49,184 --> 02:45:52,768
Somebody was raised around it and it's just absorbed it

3149
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:55,584
Then eventually you can go like oh s***

3150
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:58,144
What the f*** is around me you know

3151
02:45:58,656 --> 02:46:00,704
Yeah maybe

3152
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:06,847
There is an element to that it's kind of really shocking to see that yeah we're making more out of it then

3153
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:13,247
Really is there possible

3154
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:15,039
Makes it even more difficult is that like

3155
02:46:15,295 --> 02:46:18,879
To the best of my knowledge it didn't immediately quit right so like

3156
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:20,671
I don't know

3157
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:27,583
I mean and furthermore because it simply because of what we do we're so unused to people

3158
02:46:28,095 --> 02:46:34,239
Is it having Cuban moments on hard shell on Alex fix crying all the time but that's very clearly real

3159
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:40,639
I don't even know if anything is true when it comes to human emotions on this show right or what is actually underlying

3160
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:46,015
That you would even if it is literally could be him crying because he realize that he's so f*****

3161
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:52,671
You know I feel like that's doubtful based on just the surrounding information that cost

3162
02:46:53,695 --> 02:46:54,463
I mean if you want it

3163
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:58,303
Get really cynical with it there could just be a crying about his own pain

3164
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:04,703
Not empathizing this early with reminding me that I'm get depressed

3165
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:10,335
Memories from my own existence are what's motivating this totally

3166
02:47:10,591 --> 02:47:14,175
Really feel like it feels like there's an empathetic quality to it but

3167
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:16,991
But again I might just be seeing something today

3168
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:20,575
I would prefer to see as opposed to this is just a total

3169
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:26,975
Selfish I want to believe that he is you know it's it's one of those things

3170
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:27,999
Where I have that

3171
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:30,815
Absolute bias as well like I want to believe

3172
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:32,607
I believe that somebody can

3173
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:35,423
Change clocks Boulder compound

3174
02:47:35,935 --> 02:47:42,079
What does it say it's preferable to like thinking that this is an organism

3175
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:46,175
Break

3176
02:47:46,431 --> 02:47:51,295
And they come back and what are the things I think Bill is trying to do here is really

3177
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:52,063
Force

3178
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:58,463
Kit to recognize the Cesspool that is information comes from

3179
02:47:58,719 --> 02:48:01,279
That he got his information from

3180
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:05,887
So there's more offensive language here so just a heads up on that

3181
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:07,679
If we look at page two

3182
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:08,703
Okay

3183
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:10,751
There's a

3184
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:12,543
Picture above

3185
02:48:15,103 --> 02:48:15,615
Okay

3186
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:16,383
Alright

3187
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:17,663
Has Mister Fontaine in the middle

3188
02:48:18,175 --> 02:48:18,687
Oh okay

3189
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:21,759
Can you please read the comment that was posted

3190
02:48:22,783 --> 02:48:24,319
I'd rather not but I will because

3191
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:27,391
Did you ask me it says same as B, f*****

3192
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:31,999
Go down to

3193
02:48:32,511 --> 02:48:34,559
Or actually go down one what is the next one say

3194
02:48:35,583 --> 02:48:36,095
The nose

3195
02:48:36,863 --> 02:48:37,375
Nose

3196
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:39,423
What's the next one

3197
02:48:40,191 --> 02:48:41,215
What is it with

3198
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:42,751
They them

3199
02:48:43,007 --> 02:48:45,567
Pronouns aren't they plural pronouns

3200
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:50,175
Would you understand that to be

3201
02:48:50,431 --> 02:48:51,967
A comment related to

3202
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:52,991
Mr. fog

3203
02:48:53,247 --> 02:48:53,759
Containment

3204
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:54,783
Non-binary

3205
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:01,695
I guess

3206
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:03,743
Just because I'm not terribly familiar with

3207
02:49:03,999 --> 02:49:04,767
The terminology

3208
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:08,095
It means I'll represent in the mystery

3209
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:10,143
Does not identify as

3210
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:12,191
Okay okay

3211
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:16,031
Yes okay I could go up one that's what

3212
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:17,311
They them

3213
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:19,103
Yes they're picking apart

3214
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:20,127
The public information

3215
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:20,895
They find on him

3216
02:49:21,663 --> 02:49:22,175
Using that to

3217
02:49:22,431 --> 02:49:22,943
Make fun of him

3218
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:26,527
Then you see the photo of Mister Fontaine

3219
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:27,551
Yes

3220
02:49:28,063 --> 02:49:28,831
Right under that

3221
02:49:30,111 --> 02:49:31,135
You see a picture that was posted

3222
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:31,903
Incorrect

3223
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:33,439
It looks like it was a

3224
02:49:34,207 --> 02:49:35,231
A screenshot of a video

3225
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:38,047
Okay can you tell me what the file name

3226
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:39,071
Left

3227
02:49:39,327 --> 02:49:40,607
Wing Death Squad

3228
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:41,631
Okay

3229
02:49:45,727 --> 02:49:46,495
Go to the next one

3230
02:49:46,751 --> 02:49:47,263
Yes

3231
02:49:47,519 --> 02:49:48,287
Can you read it for me

3232
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:53,919
I can guarantee that this loser works at the

3233
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:58,015
Sorry can't relate

3234
02:49:58,271 --> 02:49:59,807
Worcester Massachusetts

3235
02:50:00,831 --> 02:50:03,647
They play loads and metal shows far more than any other John

3236
02:50:05,695 --> 02:50:06,207
Do you know where Mr

3237
02:50:06,463 --> 02:50:06,975
Fontaine work

3238
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:08,511
No

3239
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:10,303
Representative

3240
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:11,327
That at the time you work

3241
02:50:14,655 --> 02:50:20,799
So the demonstration here is of the intensely bigoted nature of the harassment

3242
02:50:21,055 --> 02:50:21,823
Ikea

3243
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:28,223
Continue to knowingly or unknowingly or through negligence haha and the

3244
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,271
Dachshund and all of this

3245
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:32,831
Is a the kernel from which

3246
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:34,111
His reporting

3247
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:35,391
Blue

3248
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:39,743
Lancer bomber

3249
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:41,535
Yeah you see all these pieces of s***

3250
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:44,863
How do you feel about that you're one of them

3251
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:51,263
It's more you have taken to their goals and achieved

3252
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:56,895
You have spread this harassment that much larger audience than would be available on this

3253
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:59,967
Pull board

3254
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:04,063
And and in some ways created a more mainstream

3255
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:08,415
Ishq place right where it's happening

3256
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:10,975
I think if it is dealing with

3257
02:51:11,231 --> 02:51:11,743
What's being

3258
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:20,703
Terrifying like oh that's a wake-up call I mean

3259
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:25,823
Italy after this deposition that says a lot I don't know I

3260
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:32,223
Can't really say that with certainty I don't know what his employment status is

3261
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:38,623
Enough to know if he has byline necessarily heard anything

3262
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:40,927
You didn't quit that speaks volume

3263
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:43,999
Oh well

3264
02:51:44,255 --> 02:51:46,047
Anyway he fell for a fortune thing

3265
02:51:46,303 --> 02:51:50,655
And unfortunately a year prior written another article

3266
02:51:51,167 --> 02:51:52,447
This is your article correct

3267
02:51:52,703 --> 02:51:53,471
I believe so yes

3268
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:56,287
Got your name on it yes

3269
02:51:57,055 --> 02:51:58,591
Can you tell me what the

3270
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:00,383
What the headline

3271
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:03,711
BBC Falls victim to 4chan trolling MS

3272
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:04,735
And cut sound like

3273
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:11,135
Howard Greek yes

3274
02:52:12,415 --> 02:52:13,951
And you wrote this article

3275
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:16,767
August

3276
02:52:17,023 --> 02:52:17,791
2070

3277
02:52:19,583 --> 02:52:20,095
About eight months

3278
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:20,863
Before

3279
02:52:21,887 --> 02:52:22,399
The article

3280
02:52:22,655 --> 02:52:23,167
Question today

3281
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:23,935
Yes

3282
02:52:32,383 --> 02:52:32,895
Now

3283
02:52:33,663 --> 02:52:34,431
The subheading

3284
02:52:35,199 --> 02:52:35,967
Catches my eye

3285
02:52:36,223 --> 02:52:40,063
Can you read it for me please me see claims visiting 4chan constitutes invest

3286
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:40,831
Desiccated granola

3287
02:52:41,855 --> 02:52:44,415
Subletting there is

3288
02:52:44,671 --> 02:52:47,487
Pointing out and making fun of BBC for falling

3289
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:48,511
Victim and

3290
02:52:48,767 --> 02:52:49,535
For thinking the fortune

3291
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:50,559
Reliable credit

3292
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:52,095
Something to that

3293
02:52:52,351 --> 02:52:52,863
Affect

3294
02:52:57,727 --> 02:52:59,263
You'd agree this one didn't really aged well

3295
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:01,055
Howard degrees so

3296
02:53:01,567 --> 02:53:06,687
There's a there's a ability for kid to kind of laugh about this stuff after

3297
02:53:07,199 --> 02:53:08,223
Wild after he

3298
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:10,015
Assertive purged himself

3299
02:53:10,271 --> 02:53:11,295
Weird

3300
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:15,647
The very weird yeah that's like flipping a weird switch

3301
02:53:16,159 --> 02:53:22,303
I know. I look like now I got to say

3302
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:28,703
Crime for destroying that guy's life man I feel like I've got egg on my face falling for a fortune

3303
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:35,103
Break after a year after complaining the other people look like

3304
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:39,199
Makes it appear that I was aware that that's what I should be looking out for

3305
02:53:39,455 --> 02:53:41,759
Hot

3306
02:53:43,039 --> 02:53:45,087
So there is a another aspect

3307
02:53:45,343 --> 02:53:50,207
To the Parkland shooting that it covered and that is that there were some

3308
02:53:50,463 --> 02:53:56,607
A bags that they're cops were taken to a car and it was suspicious

3309
02:53:56,863 --> 02:53:59,679
Soak it posted an article

3310
02:53:59,935 --> 02:54:06,079
Questions questions isn't attempts to get Kit to understand that this is not

3311
02:54:06,335 --> 02:54:06,847
Asking

3312
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:11,711
What you're doing is not asking questions 45 minute-long clip

3313
02:54:11,967 --> 02:54:15,807
You are you contending here under oath that

3314
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:17,855
The investigating officers of this

3315
02:54:18,111 --> 02:54:18,623
Shooting

3316
02:54:19,135 --> 02:54:19,647
Wearing proper

3317
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:20,927
And what they did

3318
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:23,487
I just the way I wrote this article I just

3319
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:26,303
I thought at the time the video is seem a little odd

3320
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:29,375
I'm not saying that they didn't think

3321
02:54:29,631 --> 02:54:30,143
Robert

3322
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:31,679
Sure but let me do this

3323
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:33,471
If

3324
02:54:33,727 --> 02:54:36,543
If you and I go outside of this building and we're stand

3325
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:38,591
And

3326
02:54:39,103 --> 02:54:39,871
A school bus

3327
02:54:40,127 --> 02:54:40,639
Children

3328
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:43,199
And I say

3329
02:54:44,223 --> 02:54:46,527
I was really odd how you just look at that little girl

3330
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:48,575
I'm implying some

3331
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:50,623
Nothing but I can say I'm just asking question

3332
02:54:51,135 --> 02:54:51,903
But it's not really

3333
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:53,183
Can you get that right

3334
02:54:54,463 --> 02:54:55,743
I don't know if that's a

3335
02:54:56,767 --> 02:54:58,047
If that's equivalent to this

3336
02:54:58,815 --> 02:54:59,327
Sure it is

3337
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:00,351
I'm just asking

3338
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:02,655
No I'm

3339
02:55:02,911 --> 02:55:03,679
I literally was

3340
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:07,007
To me it did seem a little odd that they were carrying it

3341
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:07,775
The time

3342
02:55:08,031 --> 02:55:09,055
And it was pointed out to

3343
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:12,127
I believe is a Jones movie wonder where that Radio 4.

3344
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:15,711
Why do you keep looking at me

3345
02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:16,991
Like

3346
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:19,807
You realize this is clickbait but you don't want

3347
02:55:21,855 --> 02:55:22,879
Because that's not my

3348
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:24,927
I'm just asking question

3349
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:26,975
You're the one that keeps bringing up

3350
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:30,559
Look in my opinion

3351
02:55:30,815 --> 02:55:32,607
They look like you're saying clickbait

3352
02:55:32,863 --> 02:55:34,143
Mets Alonso

3353
02:55:34,911 --> 02:55:35,935
Right I'm just asking

3354
02:55:36,191 --> 02:55:38,751
Question when someone has an opinion

3355
02:55:39,007 --> 02:55:40,031
I'm sorry.

3356
02:55:40,287 --> 02:55:41,567
All right here yep yep

3357
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:43,103
Yep very rude

3358
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:45,407
When someone has HID kit

3359
02:55:45,919 --> 02:55:48,735
And then they inject that opinion into a loaded question

3360
02:55:49,503 --> 02:55:50,527
With an agenda

3361
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:53,599
And they put they do it in the form of a question

3362
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:56,415
I'm just asking questions

3363
02:55:57,439 --> 02:55:58,463
It's not actually asking

3364
02:55:58,975 --> 02:55:59,999
You don't care what the

3365
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:02,047
That's what year

3366
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:02,815
Your opinion is

3367
02:56:03,071 --> 02:56:03,583
Okay

3368
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:04,607
What are the answers

3369
02:56:05,119 --> 02:56:06,911
You know now

3370
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:13,055
What do you mean did you did you go through the files of Parkland and look and see what bag was get put in that truck

3371
02:56:13,567 --> 02:56:16,895
You look good try to search and find out who these officers were

3372
02:56:17,407 --> 02:56:18,687
No it's not

3373
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:21,503
The important part is that you got body bag

3374
02:56:21,759 --> 02:56:24,063
And inverse Ponder's acting suspicious

3375
02:56:24,575 --> 02:56:26,367
The day after the shooting important

3376
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:27,647
Not the actual

3377
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:30,719
That's what your

3378
02:56:31,487 --> 02:56:32,255
I'm fine but

3379
02:56:32,511 --> 02:56:35,327
What you do to find the truth what you do to Anthony's question

3380
02:56:35,583 --> 02:56:36,607
Let's put it this way

3381
02:56:36,863 --> 02:56:38,911
Just answer my question I will answer your

3382
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:39,679
What you do

3383
02:56:40,703 --> 02:56:41,983
If I were to go back

3384
02:56:42,239 --> 02:56:43,263
I do for your request

3385
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:45,823
Define Angeles out Weeks Later

3386
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:49,151
I'm sorry the audience is already moved away from Park

3387
02:56:50,175 --> 02:56:50,687
Right

3388
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:52,223
You were writing stories

3389
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:54,783
To get your audience to read them now

3390
02:56:55,551 --> 02:56:56,063
No

3391
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:57,087
I'm writing stories

3392
02:56:57,343 --> 02:56:58,111
The audience is already paying

3393
02:56:58,879 --> 02:57:00,671
How do you know when you're going to pay attention

3394
02:57:02,207 --> 02:57:04,767
How do you know they want still want to know what are the answers

3395
02:57:05,535 --> 02:57:07,071
Because unfortunately that's how the

3396
02:57:07,327 --> 02:57:09,119
World Works nowadays people have a

3397
02:57:09,375 --> 02:57:09,887
Short attention

3398
02:57:10,399 --> 02:57:12,703
Doesn't sound like these questions are very important and does it

3399
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:14,495
That's what your

3400
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:15,519
I don't understand what you're

3401
02:57:15,775 --> 02:57:18,847
You're saying well if you had all these important question

3402
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:19,871
Right

3403
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:22,175
But never even attempted to

3404
02:57:22,687 --> 02:57:23,711
To figure out the answers

3405
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:25,503
They're not that important are they

3406
02:57:26,783 --> 02:57:27,295
I guess I sure

3407
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:34,207
Tough thing to get around obscene just care about the answer

3408
02:57:34,975 --> 02:57:38,047
That's a tough that's a tough needle to thread

3409
02:57:38,303 --> 02:57:38,815
I

3410
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:41,887
Genuinely believe he does not understand what is being a

3411
02:57:42,143 --> 02:57:42,655
Explain to him

3412
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:49,055
I do too especially that the part where I like your eyes seem to be

3413
02:57:49,311 --> 02:57:55,455
He was like I'm I'm in a completely different world sir please

3414
02:57:55,967 --> 02:57:58,783
You see how this works I'm doing this to you

3415
02:57:59,039 --> 02:57:59,807
Did not

3416
02:58:00,063 --> 02:58:01,599
Just can't get there

3417
02:58:01,855 --> 02:58:07,999
Snoopy idea of answering a question does seem anathema to Kate Daniels has possibly

3418
02:58:08,255 --> 02:58:14,143
We allot has come up and I will tell them to stop it

3419
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:20,543
He doesn't unfortunately I'm not a lot looking back on it I would have preferred to

3420
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:24,383
You have done my job completely differently from the beginning

3421
02:58:24,895 --> 02:58:26,431
So you do you know obviously

3422
02:58:26,943 --> 02:58:28,223
Questionnaire asking

3423
02:58:28,735 --> 02:58:30,015
Thought itself isn't bad

3424
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:36,415
This brings up the the notion of you got to ask the right questions or boy this is going to

3425
02:58:36,671 --> 02:58:38,207
Area 45 minute-long clip

3426
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:40,767
In your opinion are these questions and poor

3427
02:58:45,119 --> 02:58:47,167
We're trying to figure out what's going on

3428
02:58:47,423 --> 02:58:47,935
With the mass shooting

3429
02:58:49,471 --> 02:58:50,495
It is important to ask

3430
02:58:52,543 --> 02:58:53,055
The right quick

3431
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:58,687
What people who decides what the white right quick well if there we know which ones

3432
02:58:58,943 --> 02:58:59,455
Questions right

3433
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:00,991
What

3434
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:02,527
I don't know I don't know where you're getting at

3435
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:03,551
Wrong question

3436
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:05,087
Are the questions that are

3437
02:59:05,343 --> 02:59:06,111
Put out there

3438
02:59:06,367 --> 02:59:07,391
The nobody cares about

3439
02:59:07,647 --> 02:59:09,439
And nobody actually goes and tries to answer

3440
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,231
Like your article

3441
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,255
Says who

3442
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:15,583
We need to try to answer

3443
02:59:15,839 --> 02:59:19,423
Maybe that important to you you don't even care with you

3444
02:59:19,679 --> 02:59:20,447
What do you mean

3445
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:22,239
Didn't you just said

3446
02:59:22,495 --> 02:59:25,055
You did not go and do anything to get the answers

3447
02:59:25,311 --> 02:59:28,639
Boy request when it taking too long my readers wouldn't have liked it

3448
02:59:29,919 --> 02:59:31,199
So how important to Levi

3449
02:59:33,247 --> 02:59:34,527
Here's the problem I can't

3450
02:59:34,783 --> 02:59:35,807
I can't force readers

3451
02:59:37,599 --> 02:59:40,927
If I wrote about something 3 or 4 weeks after the fact

3452
02:59:42,975 --> 02:59:46,047
So Infowars audience only cares

3453
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:49,887
About the questions that are asked you mediately and they don't care about the ant

3454
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:52,959
The news audience in general tends to only focus

3455
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:54,239
Stories of the day

3456
02:59:55,263 --> 02:59:55,775
Necessarily

3457
02:59:56,543 --> 02:59:57,055
The stories I would have

3458
02:59:58,079 --> 02:59:58,591
4 weeks ago

3459
02:59:58,847 --> 03:00:00,383
Okay short where'd you get that info

3460
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:01,663
That's just

3461
03:00:02,431 --> 03:00:04,735
No it's not

3462
03:00:04,991 --> 03:00:05,503
Oops

3463
03:00:05,759 --> 03:00:09,855
You're selling yourself short there buddy are you saying that people don't want to read your work

3464
03:00:10,111 --> 03:00:16,255
Merits of your work not sure don't

3465
03:00:16,511 --> 03:00:19,839
I've got nothing interesting to say unless you are already paying attention

3466
03:00:20,095 --> 03:00:23,167
Yeah little contentious

3467
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:29,567
I think in cases like that in situations like that it's

3468
03:00:29,823 --> 03:00:31,615
To bring things back to the center

3469
03:00:31,871 --> 03:00:34,943
And find some agreement which they are able to do here

3470
03:00:35,199 --> 03:00:37,247
I'll tell you this Jones's told me

3471
03:00:37,503 --> 03:00:38,271
Years ago

3472
03:00:38,527 --> 03:00:39,039
That we were not

3473
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:47,743
I can't I can I will agree with him on that now whether or not you made your audience and I and I

3474
03:00:48,255 --> 03:00:51,327
Now whether or not you made your audience believe you words

3475
03:00:51,583 --> 03:00:54,143
Completely different question but there is no doubt in my mind

3476
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:55,679
The nothing that you do

3477
03:00:56,191 --> 03:00:56,703
Actually

3478
03:00:57,471 --> 03:00:58,239
I would agree with that

3479
03:00:58,751 --> 03:01:01,055
The problem I have is that Alex Jones is motto

3480
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:02,591
And something he's repeated

3481
03:01:02,847 --> 03:01:03,615
Over and over

3482
03:01:03,871 --> 03:01:04,639
Over again

3483
03:01:04,895 --> 03:01:06,687
Is we are the truth in

3484
03:01:09,759 --> 03:01:11,039
Starts with a j and ends with a

3485
03:01:11,295 --> 03:01:11,807
Journalism

3486
03:01:13,599 --> 03:01:15,391
Still don't know I where did you see that at

3487
03:01:15,647 --> 03:01:18,207
On his show

3488
03:01:18,463 --> 03:01:19,231
Once or twice

3489
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:20,511
Every 3 hours

3490
03:01:20,767 --> 03:01:22,559
At least for the first 3:00.

3491
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:25,375
Well unfortunately I can't speak

3492
03:01:26,143 --> 03:01:29,727
Okay so if mr. Jones the owner of the company says Infowars where the

3493
03:01:29,983 --> 03:01:30,751
The truth in journalism

3494
03:01:31,007 --> 03:01:31,519
He's lying

3495
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:34,335
I didn't say that what you said you're not journalist

3496
03:01:34,847 --> 03:01:40,991
Oh man oh man oh no god dammit assume

3497
03:01:41,247 --> 03:01:41,759
Either

3498
03:01:42,271 --> 03:01:47,391
No one at Infowars cares or LED to horrible conversation

3499
03:01:47,647 --> 03:01:52,767
Just like I could not be more a man walking through a f******

3500
03:01:53,023 --> 03:01:59,167
Crowded Street of carriages while two people are carrying a pane of glass and they're smoking watermelon carts

3501
03:01:59,423 --> 03:02:05,567
Everywhere like stepping into an absolute disaster every time he speaks

3502
03:02:05,823 --> 03:02:08,383
Just imagine I'm going to work okay boss

3503
03:02:08,639 --> 03:02:14,783
So I blamed you for a bunch of things aren't journalism if you say you are you lying

3504
03:02:15,039 --> 03:02:21,183
Also I said that it bores is responsible for

3505
03:02:21,439 --> 03:02:27,583
Starting to think I am not going to have a good day today I can just go back to my desk

3506
03:02:27,839 --> 03:02:33,983
Practice is apologizing for things I did wrong really does want to go

3507
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:40,383
Get out of the line of questioning where it's like hey you didn't even look into any of this

3508
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:41,407
Someone else's fault

3509
03:02:41,663 --> 03:02:42,175
Let me ask you

3510
03:02:43,967 --> 03:02:44,991
What was in this bag

3511
03:02:46,271 --> 03:02:47,551
I don't know what the weapons

3512
03:02:47,807 --> 03:02:48,319
I don't know

3513
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:51,135
How many shooters were involved

3514
03:02:51,903 --> 03:02:52,671
Was it just one or more

3515
03:02:52,927 --> 03:02:53,439
I don't know

3516
03:02:58,815 --> 03:02:59,583
What was

3517
03:02:59,839 --> 03:03:01,887
Why did it take to train professionals

3518
03:03:02,143 --> 03:03:02,911
To carry this bag

3519
03:03:03,423 --> 03:03:03,935
I don't know

3520
03:03:05,471 --> 03:03:07,263
Is it scissor SWAT gear in that bag

3521
03:03:08,543 --> 03:03:10,079
Are these questions that you find in Port

3522
03:03:10,847 --> 03:03:11,359
I don't know

3523
03:03:14,943 --> 03:03:16,223
We're not important enough for you to go

3524
03:03:17,503 --> 03:03:18,015
We know that

3525
03:03:18,527 --> 03:03:19,039
Well

3526
03:03:19,295 --> 03:03:21,343
If I remember correctly I wrote this article at the

3527
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:22,111
Somebody

3528
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:23,647
How many tolls

3529
03:03:24,159 --> 03:03:24,671
I believe so

3530
03:03:24,927 --> 03:03:26,207
I think it was Jones or a RAV4

3531
03:03:26,463 --> 03:03:26,975
Like I said

3532
03:03:27,231 --> 03:03:27,743
And Jones head

3533
03:03:27,999 --> 03:03:31,839
Here's some footage this is what I want you to write on remember I just vaguely remember someone

3534
03:03:32,351 --> 03:03:32,863
Ask me to write

3535
03:03:33,887 --> 03:03:35,423
Okay so this article would have been

3536
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:37,215
About

3537
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:40,287
It is not necessarily your beliefs you just wrote

3538
03:03:40,543 --> 03:03:41,055
Something that

3539
03:03:41,311 --> 03:03:41,823
Somebody asked you to

3540
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:42,847
Basically

3541
03:03:43,615 --> 03:03:44,127
Is my understand

3542
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:45,663
And you would agree with me

3543
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:47,199
These aren't these are

3544
03:03:47,711 --> 03:03:48,991
You don't actually care what the answers

3545
03:03:50,015 --> 03:03:50,527
Right

3546
03:03:51,295 --> 03:03:52,063
I mean

3547
03:03:52,831 --> 03:03:54,111
Wow

3548
03:03:54,367 --> 03:04:00,511
Exasperated seismic about the best you can do

3549
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:01,535
Fashion Center

3550
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:08,191
I am very tired and you make me feel very bad about myself I would like to not do this anymore can we do that

3551
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:14,591
It's Alex's fault or some producer somebody else told me to do this

3552
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:17,151
Did you hear me try and read the things you asked me to read

3553
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:18,687
Do you think I'm good at reading

3554
03:04:18,943 --> 03:04:19,455
Or writing

3555
03:04:20,735 --> 03:04:23,807
This this there's still another matter to be

3556
03:04:24,063 --> 03:04:24,831
Still

3557
03:04:25,343 --> 03:04:31,231
The question of like not answering these questions

3558
03:04:31,487 --> 03:04:35,839
Being driven really trying to get this home to cat cuz I think it is important it is

3559
03:04:36,095 --> 03:04:41,727
If you thought these questions were important you would have asked you would have gone and looked for the answer

3560
03:04:42,239 --> 03:04:43,007
At some point

3561
03:04:43,263 --> 03:04:43,775
Queen

3562
03:04:44,287 --> 03:04:45,055
February

3563
03:04:45,311 --> 03:04:46,335
2018

3564
03:04:46,591 --> 03:04:47,103
And today

3565
03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:48,383
February of 20

3566
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:49,151
22

3567
03:04:49,919 --> 03:04:50,431
Right

3568
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:52,223
Like I said

3569
03:04:52,479 --> 03:04:53,503
I don't consider myself a

3570
03:04:53,759 --> 03:04:54,271
Investigator

3571
03:04:55,551 --> 03:04:56,831
I consider myself more as a

3572
03:04:57,343 --> 03:04:57,855
Commentator

3573
03:04:58,111 --> 03:04:59,647
I don't even believe I've ever done

3574
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:00,415
Spyderco

3575
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:01,183
Safari like

3576
03:05:01,951 --> 03:05:03,231
Amazing

3577
03:05:07,583 --> 03:05:08,095
It's right

3578
03:05:08,607 --> 03:05:09,119
You just ask

3579
03:05:10,143 --> 03:05:13,215
I think I would have I would have been interested if I could find the answers of it

3580
03:05:13,471 --> 03:05:14,751
Within a couple days this

3581
03:05:15,263 --> 03:05:16,799
Are you saying you couldn't find those ants

3582
03:05:18,591 --> 03:05:19,103
No

3583
03:05:19,615 --> 03:05:20,127
You're not saying that

3584
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:21,151
What's that

3585
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:24,735
I'm saying I doubt I could have found the answer to this question

3586
03:05:24,991 --> 03:05:25,759
In a couple days with him

3587
03:05:27,039 --> 03:05:28,063
Mister Daniels

3588
03:05:28,319 --> 03:05:28,831
Try

3589
03:05:30,367 --> 03:05:32,415
I didn't think I could

3590
03:05:32,671 --> 03:05:33,183
You never tried

3591
03:05:33,951 --> 03:05:35,743
What is an investigative journalist

3592
03:05:38,303 --> 03:05:40,351
Maybe I just don't understand the question

3593
03:05:40,863 --> 03:05:43,679
Trying to put it out there sometimes Infowars

3594
03:05:43,935 --> 03:05:45,215
Has articles that go out

3595
03:05:45,727 --> 03:05:46,239
Weather Renton

3596
03:05:47,007 --> 03:05:48,287
In your perspective or on

3597
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:49,823
Half of somebody else

3598
03:05:50,591 --> 03:05:51,103
That asked

3599
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:52,895
Questions quote-unquote

3600
03:05:53,407 --> 03:05:54,943
To stir up fear

3601
03:05:55,199 --> 03:05:56,223
Or stir up at

3602
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:56,991
Fierce Ethier

3603
03:05:57,503 --> 03:05:58,015
Like

3604
03:05:59,039 --> 03:06:00,319
There was a body in the bag

3605
03:06:00,831 --> 03:06:01,599
Or there was wet

3606
03:06:02,111 --> 03:06:04,415
In the bag or that there was SWAT gear in the bag

3607
03:06:04,927 --> 03:06:06,463
Or that it was a dead body

3608
03:06:06,975 --> 03:06:07,487
Or that

3609
03:06:10,047 --> 03:06:13,375
That the bat that this was taken during the shooting all of these

3610
03:06:13,631 --> 03:06:14,655
Just questions

3611
03:06:15,679 --> 03:06:17,727
They're all there just to incite people

3612
03:06:17,983 --> 03:06:18,495
22

3613
03:06:19,263 --> 03:06:20,031
Say oh my gosh

3614
03:06:20,543 --> 03:06:22,079
Something might be up and then

3615
03:06:22,335 --> 03:06:23,359
Where do they start going

3616
03:06:24,383 --> 03:06:26,687
They start coming back to ww.w

3617
03:06:27,455 --> 03:06:27,967
Fill in the blank

3618
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:31,039
Infowars.

3619
03:06:31,807 --> 03:06:32,831
Cuz that's where the salsa

3620
03:06:33,599 --> 03:06:34,367
It's tough

3621
03:06:34,623 --> 03:06:38,463
Forget to refute any of this because

3622
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:39,743
Is it pretty app

3623
03:06:39,999 --> 03:06:40,767
Description of

3624
03:06:41,535 --> 03:06:42,303
What he did

3625
03:06:43,071 --> 03:06:48,959
This is just exciting questions

3626
03:06:49,215 --> 03:06:54,079
To imply that you have some kind of information that isn't accessible anywhere else

3627
03:06:54,335 --> 03:06:55,103
Right and then

3628
03:06:55,359 --> 03:06:57,151
Get them into your Revenue stream Mariah

3629
03:06:57,663 --> 03:07:03,807
How do I get it he's trapped in the f****** Fox News right-wing propaganda brain where the idea is never

3630
03:07:04,063 --> 03:07:07,391
I mean the job of right-wing media is to remove curiosity

3631
03:07:07,903 --> 03:07:11,231
By destroying the value of questions you know like

3632
03:07:11,487 --> 03:07:15,071
Gay marriage what's next are you going to marry your dog you don't

3633
03:07:15,327 --> 03:07:16,607
Actually want to know what's next

3634
03:07:16,863 --> 03:07:21,215
What's next is more equality and everybody gets better you want to next

3635
03:07:21,471 --> 03:07:21,983
Yeah

3636
03:07:22,239 --> 03:07:26,591
Couples getting married questions don't mean anything questions are just reasons to hate

3637
03:07:29,151 --> 03:07:29,663
So

3638
03:07:29,919 --> 03:07:36,063
There's that there's a fundamental issue going on and that is that the retraction of this story was not

3639
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:36,831
I'm done correct

3640
03:07:37,087 --> 03:07:40,927
Involved picture of Marcel Fontaine

3641
03:07:41,183 --> 03:07:42,975
And so

3642
03:07:43,231 --> 03:07:43,999
Kent has

3643
03:07:44,255 --> 03:07:45,791
An excuse about this

3644
03:07:46,047 --> 03:07:46,815
It is troubling

3645
03:07:47,583 --> 03:07:49,887
Do you know what date Mister Fontaine filed a lawsuit

3646
03:07:52,959 --> 03:07:53,983
Around that same time frame

3647
03:07:55,775 --> 03:07:56,287
The first

3648
03:07:59,103 --> 03:08:00,383
And he did that because

3649
03:08:01,407 --> 03:08:03,711
Standard language that should have been in the original

3650
03:08:03,967 --> 03:08:05,247
It's not just okay for you to take

3651
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:08,063
This is what's required

3652
03:08:08,575 --> 03:08:09,855
And because he gave you

3653
03:08:10,623 --> 03:08:11,903
2/2 weeks

3654
03:08:12,671 --> 03:08:14,207
And nobody did anything about it

3655
03:08:14,463 --> 03:08:14,975
That's where this

3656
03:08:17,791 --> 03:08:21,119
Do you find the retraction clarification and correction

3657
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:23,935
A bit disingenuous

3658
03:08:24,191 --> 03:08:24,703
Considering

3659
03:08:25,471 --> 03:08:26,239
It was in response

3660
03:08:28,287 --> 03:08:28,799
No

3661
03:08:29,055 --> 03:08:29,567
If he

3662
03:08:32,127 --> 03:08:33,407
Here's my problem I told her

3663
03:08:35,967 --> 03:08:36,735
Attorney-client

3664
03:08:37,503 --> 03:08:38,015
That's privileged

3665
03:08:39,039 --> 03:08:40,319
Okay well I'm not going to say what I told

3666
03:08:42,623 --> 03:08:43,647
You can say what you

3667
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:45,439
What are you not supposed to tell me what

3668
03:08:45,695 --> 03:08:47,231
But she wasn't legal advice she

3669
03:08:47,487 --> 03:08:48,255
Okay I understand that

3670
03:08:49,279 --> 03:08:49,791
Peppa

3671
03:08:50,815 --> 03:08:53,119
My problem was that the timer counts

3672
03:08:53,375 --> 03:08:54,399
Lyric child apparently

3673
03:08:54,655 --> 03:08:55,167
You said on that

3674
03:08:55,423 --> 03:08:55,935
Letter that you

3675
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:02,591
Excuse me

3676
03:09:02,847 --> 03:09:05,151
Am I understanding is we had when we when we

3677
03:09:05,663 --> 03:09:08,479
Saw the letter in the lawsuit we had we went and got other count

3678
03:09:09,503 --> 03:09:10,015
To write the

3679
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:10,783
Protractor

3680
03:09:11,551 --> 03:09:13,855
Did you know that Mr tab actually represented you

3681
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:16,159
All the way up until about

3682
03:09:20,255 --> 03:09:20,767
4 years in this

3683
03:09:21,023 --> 03:09:21,791
Excuse me

3684
03:09:22,303 --> 03:09:23,583
He pulled out

3685
03:09:26,655 --> 03:09:32,799
There is a allegation be made he ignored this

3686
03:09:33,055 --> 03:09:35,359
The man for a retraction

3687
03:09:35,615 --> 03:09:40,735
And then they got new Council but he was still the council until very recently before this deposition

3688
03:09:41,247 --> 03:09:45,087
This is troubling Daniels lawyer I would have said do not

3689
03:09:45,599 --> 03:09:51,743
Say any of that produces a lot more questions a lawyer said on this

3690
03:09:51,999 --> 03:09:52,511
30 days

3691
03:09:52,767 --> 03:09:56,095
May I have more details about that information thank you very much

3692
03:09:56,351 --> 03:09:59,935
Yeah yeah it's bad but also even

3693
03:10:01,215 --> 03:10:01,983
Given all that

3694
03:10:02,239 --> 03:10:05,311
Understanding about the rules

3695
03:10:05,567 --> 03:10:07,615
About retraction

3696
03:10:07,871 --> 03:10:11,455
And the bike down for this because this is the cliff where you can hero last okay

3697
03:10:12,223 --> 03:10:12,991
And your is your content

3698
03:10:15,039 --> 03:10:15,551
He sat on the

3699
03:10:20,159 --> 03:10:21,183
It was Donner the right

3700
03:10:24,255 --> 03:10:26,815
I mean it might hurt and we have like three days

3701
03:10:27,583 --> 03:10:28,095
Retracting up

3702
03:10:29,887 --> 03:10:31,679
According to Texas state laws

3703
03:10:31,935 --> 03:10:32,447
Set 30

3704
03:10:34,495 --> 03:10:35,263
And even if it

3705
03:10:35,519 --> 03:10:36,031
30

3706
03:10:37,311 --> 03:10:39,359
You got my letter on February 18th

3707
03:10:41,151 --> 03:10:41,663
You changed it

3708
03:10:42,687 --> 03:10:43,711
April 2nd

3709
03:10:43,967 --> 03:10:46,271
I don't remember if I even saw the letter until the lawsuit

3710
03:10:47,295 --> 03:10:47,807
Sure

3711
03:10:48,063 --> 03:10:49,855
But I'm just saying when you said you met the time for

3712
03:10:51,647 --> 03:10:52,671
Don't know how many days are counting

3713
03:10:54,719 --> 03:10:57,535
But we don't we don't understand it as we don't

3714
03:10:58,559 --> 03:10:59,327
Practice law in Texas

3715
03:10:59,583 --> 03:11:00,095
Turn on weekends

3716
03:11:05,983 --> 03:11:07,775
Well I mean

3717
03:11:08,799 --> 03:11:09,567
Do you do deposition

3718
03:11:09,823 --> 03:11:10,335
Saturday

3719
03:11:10,847 --> 03:11:11,359
Absolutely

3720
03:11:13,663 --> 03:11:16,735
It was

3721
03:11:17,503 --> 03:11:23,647
My understanding is in Texas who don't practice law on weekend

3722
03:11:23,903 --> 03:11:30,047
My understanding in Texas and please stop me if you know

3723
03:11:30,303 --> 03:11:36,447
Know any more about this than I do perhaps are you some sort of lawyer that practices and some sort of State

3724
03:11:36,703 --> 03:11:37,471
My understanding

3725
03:11:37,727 --> 03:11:40,031
Despite you very clearly saying

3726
03:11:40,287 --> 03:11:43,103
All the words that would suggest what I'm about to say is not true

3727
03:11:43,871 --> 03:11:48,223
Did you guys work on Saturday

3728
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:50,527
I know from first-hand experience

3729
03:11:50,783 --> 03:11:52,575
Being at a deposition in Texas

3730
03:11:52,831 --> 03:11:57,951
What happened on the weekend before this deposition

3731
03:11:58,207 --> 03:12:01,023
Your people at Infowars what deposed on weekend

3732
03:12:01,791 --> 03:12:05,631
Get your note this is nonsense but I think it is a fun little bit of like

3733
03:12:05,887 --> 03:12:07,167
Haha I'm back

3734
03:12:07,423 --> 03:12:08,191
Who told him that

3735
03:12:08,447 --> 03:12:14,591
I don't get that information through books

3736
03:12:14,847 --> 03:12:20,991
Genuinely want to know where it is you got that

3737
03:12:21,247 --> 03:12:23,551
Custody

3738
03:12:24,831 --> 03:12:28,927
So there's still more problems with his retraction though and this also is another thing

3739
03:12:29,695 --> 03:12:31,999
It might get scolded by Alex for this

3740
03:12:32,255 --> 03:12:33,535
I do have a question about

3741
03:12:34,559 --> 03:12:35,071
Okay

3742
03:12:37,631 --> 03:12:38,143
Here

3743
03:12:40,703 --> 03:12:46,847
Is on this webpage on February 14th 2018 we showed a photograph of a Young Man

3744
03:12:47,103 --> 03:12:48,895
That we had received

3745
03:12:51,199 --> 03:12:51,967
Very puzzled

3746
03:12:52,479 --> 03:12:53,503
Considering you said

3747
03:12:53,759 --> 03:12:54,271
You

3748
03:12:54,783 --> 03:12:55,295
Pulled it

3749
03:12:58,623 --> 03:13:00,415
You're right so whoever wrote that

3750
03:13:00,927 --> 03:13:02,975
That's that clarification also isn't

3751
03:13:04,511 --> 03:13:07,327
Only those words I did bring up to Alex Jones

3752
03:13:07,583 --> 03:13:08,351
I didn't like

3753
03:13:08,607 --> 03:13:09,119
We had

3754
03:13:10,655 --> 03:13:11,167
What did he say

3755
03:13:11,679 --> 03:13:12,191
He said

3756
03:13:12,447 --> 03:13:13,215
Just left the lawyers how

3757
03:13:15,519 --> 03:13:16,543
Adult

3758
03:13:16,799 --> 03:13:20,127
Say Alex's name in the

3759
03:13:21,151 --> 03:13:27,295
Only going to get Alex in trouble

3760
03:13:28,575 --> 03:13:34,719
Alex told me I brought up that exact point to Alex he told me to shut up

3761
03:13:34,975 --> 03:13:41,119
How is it that he is not been able to remember so much but this one time he's like oh yeah that one I deaf

3762
03:13:41,375 --> 03:13:42,399
Emily brought that up to Alex

3763
03:13:42,655 --> 03:13:47,775
Probably a problem not have been more certain that he took that exact complained to Alec

3764
03:13:48,031 --> 03:13:49,055
Amazing

3765
03:13:49,567 --> 03:13:53,919
So I can't read this article so what happened the next day

3766
03:13:56,479 --> 03:13:57,503
Kind of funny

3767
03:13:57,759 --> 03:14:00,575
The day after you posted your story

3768
03:14:01,087 --> 03:14:04,415
Paul Joseph Watson who at the time I believed was

3769
03:14:06,207 --> 03:14:08,511
What was the role you gave him not Chief editor

3770
03:14:08,767 --> 03:14:09,791
Editor-at-large

3771
03:14:10,047 --> 03:14:12,095
That's how we refer to himself in his biography

3772
03:14:12,607 --> 03:14:13,631
And he says so

3773
03:14:13,887 --> 03:14:20,031
The alt right in the alt left media crafted a fake news narrative that fulfilled both

3774
03:14:20,287 --> 03:14:20,799
Their objective

3775
03:14:21,567 --> 03:14:23,359
Using made up 4chan posts

3776
03:14:23,871 --> 03:14:24,383
Less than

3777
03:14:24,639 --> 03:14:25,919
24-hours after

3778
03:14:26,175 --> 03:14:27,455
A bloody massacre

3779
03:14:28,223 --> 03:14:29,247
Killed 17 people

3780
03:14:29,759 --> 03:14:30,783
. okay

3781
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:33,343
You realize mr. w

03:14:33,599 --> 03:14:34,111
Contactually make

3783
03:14:35,903 --> 03:14:36,927
He doesn't realize that

3784
03:14:37,183 --> 03:14:37,951
You did this

3785
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:42,303
Sandy

3786
03:14:43,327 --> 03:14:44,095
Bye mister

3787
03:14:44,863 --> 03:14:47,679
Response to him and says that's rich coming from you

3788
03:14:48,191 --> 03:14:52,287
Infowars published false information in the wrong photo in propaganda f

3789
03:14:52,799 --> 03:14:55,359
To link the left and and antifreeze

3790
03:14:56,127 --> 03:14:57,663
You are a huge part of the problem

3791
03:14:58,943 --> 03:14:59,711
Complete Hip Hop

3792
03:15:01,247 --> 03:15:02,271
He's not wrong there is

3793
03:15:03,039 --> 03:15:04,319
Let's San Diego

3794
03:15:06,623 --> 03:15:12,767
Clarifies it like you didn't do it maliciously

3795
03:15:13,023 --> 03:15:15,327
But I understand

3796
03:15:15,583 --> 03:15:18,399
Hey I just find it tough

3797
03:15:18,655 --> 03:15:24,799
How do you how do you continue working there having build your own

3798
03:15:25,311 --> 03:15:30,943
Senior editor or whatever was posting articles mocking the very work that you're getting sued over

3799
03:15:31,199 --> 03:15:37,343
I legitimately don't know how this dude f****** brushes his teeth every morning I don't know if he speaks

3800
03:15:37,599 --> 03:15:43,743
Who is blender I don't know if you've given things Fantastical names like I sleep in the double bed

3801
03:15:43,999 --> 03:15:48,607
Don't know it's I don't know how this dude function it's pretty confusing it is bananas to me

3802
03:15:48,863 --> 03:15:52,959
He also wrote some stuff about the Las Vegas shooting place on

3803
03:15:53,215 --> 03:15:56,287
Some Notions of antifa literature and what have you

3804
03:15:56,543 --> 03:15:58,591
Bill wants to establish that that

3805
03:15:58,847 --> 03:15:59,615
Was also click

3806
03:16:00,383 --> 03:16:01,407
I'm asking one question

3807
03:16:01,663 --> 03:16:02,175
Okay

3808
03:16:05,247 --> 03:16:05,759
Your

3809
03:16:07,295 --> 03:16:10,367
Your headline says Vegas shooter found with antifa literature

3810
03:16:10,623 --> 03:16:11,135
Right

3811
03:16:11,903 --> 03:16:12,415
Yes

3812
03:16:13,183 --> 03:16:14,719
Point me where you get that

3813
03:16:15,487 --> 03:16:15,999
In this article

3814
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:19,583
I don't see a in bed for

3815
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:21,887
You know why

3816
03:16:22,399 --> 03:16:23,167
I don't remember

3817
03:16:23,423 --> 03:16:24,703
Because the headline

3818
03:16:26,751 --> 03:16:27,519
That's your opinion

3819
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:29,567
Not good

3820
03:16:31,103 --> 03:16:32,639
Oh my God what do words mean

3821
03:16:33,151 --> 03:16:34,431
Nothing that's what I thought

3822
03:16:34,943 --> 03:16:39,295
So this article that kit had written about the Las Vegas shooting

3823
03:16:40,319 --> 03:16:40,831
Hayes

3824
03:16:41,087 --> 03:16:42,367
Debatably clickbait

3825
03:16:42,879 --> 03:16:43,903
But

3826
03:16:44,159 --> 03:16:47,231
The information that he's running within this

3827
03:16:47,487 --> 03:16:49,535
Comes from dubious Origins

3828
03:16:49,791 --> 03:16:51,327
Essentially just from alley

3829
03:16:51,583 --> 03:16:52,095
Right

3830
03:16:52,351 --> 03:16:52,863
Now

3831
03:16:53,119 --> 03:16:53,631
This

3832
03:16:54,143 --> 03:16:59,007
Winding down this deposition here and I think it ends with

3833
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:01,311
A scathing revelation

3834
03:17:01,567 --> 03:17:03,615
About how Infowars work okay

3835
03:17:04,127 --> 03:17:07,711
I wrote the headline in the in the lead sentence on Bahasa

3836
03:17:07,967 --> 03:17:08,735
Farmer

3837
03:17:08,991 --> 03:17:09,503
Correctly

3838
03:17:10,015 --> 03:17:11,039
He showed me the

3839
03:17:11,551 --> 03:17:12,319
Taxi got from

3840
03:17:13,599 --> 03:17:15,391
That you don't know if is even real

3841
03:17:15,903 --> 03:17:17,951
It could have been Doctor Jones with

3842
03:17:18,463 --> 03:17:19,999
Seriously doubt that

3843
03:17:20,511 --> 03:17:21,023
You don't know

3844
03:17:21,535 --> 03:17:22,559
But I seriously doubt you do

3845
03:17:23,583 --> 03:17:24,351
Just finding work

3846
03:17:25,375 --> 03:17:31,519
How do you write multiple articles telling you put stuff in it you can't backup

3847
03:17:31,775 --> 03:17:34,335
Maybe maybe the in bed for the

3848
03:17:34,847 --> 03:17:36,383
Okay I'm sorry

3849
03:17:37,151 --> 03:17:38,431
The nobody can corroborate

3850
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:40,735
He's got you putting your name out there

3851
03:17:43,807 --> 03:17:45,855
But you would agree with me nothing

3852
03:17:46,367 --> 03:17:47,391
About this article

3853
03:17:47,647 --> 03:17:48,671
Has anything

3854
03:17:49,183 --> 03:17:50,207
To do with antifa

3855
03:17:50,463 --> 03:17:53,023
Other than the headline Jones force you to put on the top of the

3856
03:17:54,047 --> 03:17:55,071
Antifa Twitter

3857
03:17:55,327 --> 03:17:55,839
There's a

3858
03:17:57,375 --> 03:17:59,935
There's nothing in this article besides

3859
03:18:00,191 --> 03:18:00,703
The

3860
03:18:01,983 --> 03:18:04,287
The headline that mr. Jones portion put on here

3861
03:18:04,543 --> 03:18:05,823
It has anything to do with

3862
03:18:07,359 --> 03:18:09,151
Well that was what the source Paul Jones

3863
03:18:09,407 --> 03:18:10,431
Where is it

3864
03:18:10,687 --> 03:18:12,991
Where's the screenshot where's the screen filling out

3865
03:18:13,759 --> 03:18:14,783
So here's the thing

3866
03:18:15,039 --> 03:18:18,879
Why is that your headline is the article doesn't talk about it at all

3867
03:18:19,647 --> 03:18:20,159
That's a question

3868
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:20,927
A Jones

3869
03:18:21,183 --> 03:18:21,695
Okay

3870
03:18:22,207 --> 03:18:23,231
2 in in inches

3871
03:18:23,999 --> 03:18:24,511
Tucana breakdown

3872
03:18:25,023 --> 03:18:26,047
John's discount

3873
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:27,839
Said you're writing this and kind of forced

3874
03:18:28,095 --> 03:18:29,631
The right is this isn't something you want

3875
03:18:30,399 --> 03:18:31,935
My understanding is this is something

3876
03:18:32,447 --> 03:18:33,215
Ask me to write

3877
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:34,495
And he gave me the

3878
03:18:34,751 --> 03:18:35,519
The information

3879
03:18:36,031 --> 03:18:38,591
Did he ask you in a way where he would have been okay if you said no

3880
03:18:42,175 --> 03:18:43,199
Cuz when you have something like this

3881
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:44,991
You do it now

3882
03:18:45,247 --> 03:18:45,759
Why is my boss

3883
03:18:46,015 --> 03:18:51,391
So this may not be as a relevant in a legal setting but this clip is super important for my interest

3884
03:18:51,903 --> 03:18:55,231
I found that the methodology for how enforce works as a broadcaster

3885
03:18:55,487 --> 03:18:57,535
But Alex will use Infowars articles

3886
03:18:57,791 --> 03:19:00,607
Specifically there headlines to build his on-air narratives

3887
03:19:00,863 --> 03:19:06,751
Often times these headlines do not accurately reflect the body of the article butter worded specifically it away

3888
03:19:07,007 --> 03:19:11,359
So that they can be useful to whatever conspiracy Alex is trying to prove or demonstrate on air

3889
03:19:11,871 --> 03:19:13,407
In some cases these are

3890
03:19:13,663 --> 03:19:19,807
Fully in-house articles and in other cases their articles from other outlets where the body of the article is copy-pasted

3891
03:19:20,063 --> 03:19:21,087
Onto the Infowars site

3892
03:19:21,343 --> 03:19:24,927
In a wholly new a headline is attached to make it more useful for Alex

3893
03:19:25,695 --> 03:19:30,559
The Revelation that Alex is directly telling his managing editor what headlines to put on stories

3894
03:19:30,815 --> 03:19:35,167
Is basically the piece that completes the circle of Alex just making all this s*** up

3895
03:19:35,679 --> 03:19:39,007
He's on are pretending to cover news stories but in reality

3896
03:19:39,263 --> 03:19:44,639
It's just him yelling about headlines that he's told his employees to put on story so he can more easily yell about them

3897
03:19:45,407 --> 03:19:50,271
This is completely self-contained information space where everything is just basically Alex's win

3898
03:19:51,039 --> 03:19:51,807
It was pretty

3899
03:19:52,063 --> 03:19:56,927
Cleared that this was what was going on but it seems like a much more reasonable assumption to think that like

3900
03:19:57,183 --> 03:20:01,791
The in-house culture was just that employees and do what Alex wanted and then they provided

3901
03:20:03,071 --> 03:20:09,215
Maybe some subtle prodding if you didn't take the right angle Rob do would scold you or you wouldn't get as big of a

3902
03:20:12,287 --> 03:20:18,175
Enough to get the message across and ultimately the people who did the right job would stick around at the people who didn't

3903
03:20:18,431 --> 03:20:20,479
Livefit that company culture they wouldn't last

3904
03:20:21,247 --> 03:20:26,879
To me it's an entirely different ball game for Alex to be actively directing the production of the news he's covering

3905
03:20:27,135 --> 03:20:29,695
And having an active role in the creation of the headline

3906
03:20:29,951 --> 03:20:32,511
Which are the only parts of the story he ever really cover

3907
03:20:33,279 --> 03:20:34,815
Given this workflow like what

3908
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:37,375
Story could Alex not manufacture

3909
03:20:38,143 --> 03:20:44,287
All he needs is an Infowars article to justify anything you might say on air and he could just tell one of his Moby underlings to create that

3910
03:20:44,543 --> 03:20:50,175
These underlings know better than to not give Alex what he wants

3911
03:20:50,943 --> 03:20:54,015
F***** up 8/8 like

3912
03:20:54,527 --> 03:20:58,623
We reverse-engineered this from watching the show

3913
03:20:58,879 --> 03:21:03,743
And it's like but even then you create a series of plausible sound except

3914
03:21:03,999 --> 03:21:06,047
That would lead you to the result that you have

3915
03:21:06,815 --> 03:21:10,399
To have somebody not only tell you that those steps were totally right

3916
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:12,447
But to also be like and guess what there are

3917
03:21:12,703 --> 03:21:13,983
Fewer steps than you thought

3918
03:21:14,239 --> 03:21:15,775
It's just Alex

3919
03:21:16,031 --> 03:21:21,407
He's f****** insane because like you just have demonstrable observable things like

3920
03:21:21,919 --> 03:21:28,063
Alex only really covers headlines ever match the body of the article

3921
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:31,391
* there will be articles match

3922
03:21:31,647 --> 03:21:37,791
Where they were originally posted with totally new headline these are all factual observable things

3923
03:21:38,047 --> 03:21:40,863
That lead you to the conclusion that this is an intentional scratch

3924
03:21:42,143 --> 03:21:43,167
Izzy's

3925
03:21:43,423 --> 03:21:46,495
They creep he's for Alex to yell about things on

3926
03:21:47,519 --> 03:21:51,359
You wouldn't want to jump to the conclusion that Alex is telling people what to write

3927
03:21:51,615 --> 03:21:57,247
Because it makes it easier for him to Yellow

3928
03:21:58,015 --> 03:22:04,159
Here we are here we are we have just been given that leap I guess I would go so far as to say that

3929
03:22:04,415 --> 03:22:07,743
That the one thing you would not want your employee to tell

3930
03:22:08,255 --> 03:22:10,303
Is that very fact

3931
03:22:10,559 --> 03:22:16,703
Yeah so we have one last clip in this deposition and it's actually a demonstration of how this process work

3932
03:22:17,471 --> 03:22:19,519
With the headline being used

3933
03:22:19,775 --> 03:22:21,055
Do essentially create

3934
03:22:21,311 --> 03:22:23,103
Idb broadcast

3935
03:22:23,615 --> 03:22:26,175
Open that article up go to the last page where the tweeters

3936
03:22:27,199 --> 03:22:28,735
And read what mr. Jones tweeted

3937
03:22:32,063 --> 03:22:33,087
That one right there okay

3938
03:22:34,623 --> 03:22:35,135
Last page

3939
03:22:39,231 --> 03:22:39,743
Sorry

3940
03:22:49,471 --> 03:22:50,239
Scavenger hunt

3941
03:22:52,287 --> 03:22:54,591
Right back to laugh

3942
03:22:54,847 --> 03:22:55,359
Read it

3943
03:22:55,615 --> 03:22:57,151
Police live Isis takes

3944
03:22:57,407 --> 03:22:59,199
Responsibility for Vegas shooting has left

3945
03:22:59,455 --> 03:23:00,223
Celebrates Massacre

3946
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:03,551
Can you tell me

3947
03:23:03,807 --> 03:23:04,575
Why you put that in there

3948
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:08,159
I don't know if I did put it in there myself

3949
03:23:08,671 --> 03:23:09,183
It might have been just

3950
03:23:09,695 --> 03:23:10,463
You might had a script

3951
03:23:10,719 --> 03:23:11,231
Set the time

3952
03:23:11,487 --> 03:23:13,535
Do you think anyone on the left

3953
03:23:13,791 --> 03:23:15,583
Was celebrating what happened in Las Vegas

3954
03:23:15,839 --> 03:23:16,607
I don't know

3955
03:23:16,863 --> 03:23:17,375
Personally

3956
03:23:17,631 --> 03:23:18,143
I don't know

3957
03:23:19,167 --> 03:23:19,679
So

3958
03:23:20,447 --> 03:23:21,727
And your opinion you have

3959
03:23:21,983 --> 03:23:24,287
Zero evidence that anyone from the left

3960
03:23:25,567 --> 03:23:26,335
Was celebrating

3961
03:23:27,871 --> 03:23:29,151
I don't know I mean I didn't write this

3962
03:23:30,431 --> 03:23:31,967
Will you put in your article correct

3963
03:23:32,223 --> 03:23:32,991
I put it in Bedford

3964
03:23:33,247 --> 03:23:34,271
For Twitter for Joneses

3965
03:23:34,527 --> 03:23:35,039
Radio program

3966
03:23:35,551 --> 03:23:40,671
Okay so that's just an advertisement that has happens to be on the same subject matter as your art

3967
03:23:42,719 --> 03:23:45,023
I don't know if advertisement is accurate but I guess

3968
03:23:45,279 --> 03:23:47,071
For lack of a better term

3969
03:23:48,095 --> 03:23:49,375
If there isn't a better term

3970
03:23:49,631 --> 03:23:51,679
That maybe that was amazing was the

3971
03:23:52,191 --> 03:23:52,959
When was this published

3972
03:23:55,007 --> 03:23:56,543
It just might have been coincidence

3973
03:23:56,799 --> 03:23:57,567
Said they put the

3974
03:23:58,079 --> 03:23:58,847
He's talking about

3975
03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:00,639
That on the same day this article

3976
03:24:02,175 --> 03:24:03,711
And it could be coincidence that

3977
03:24:04,223 --> 03:24:06,015
He had asked you to write that are

3978
03:24:08,063 --> 03:24:08,575
Right

3979
03:24:11,391 --> 03:24:17,535
True I wouldn't if I were him either not understand that question

3980
03:24:17,791 --> 03:24:20,351
A2B demonstration of

3981
03:24:20,607 --> 03:24:25,983
Alex asked you to write this headline or told you to and you knew you couldn't not do it

3982
03:24:26,239 --> 03:24:32,127
And there is an embedded headline of his

3983
03:24:32,383 --> 03:24:36,223
Covering this news story in the way he told you to cover it

3984
03:24:36,479 --> 03:24:39,807
Using your article as the justification for it it's just

3985
03:24:41,087 --> 03:24:43,903
It's a damning indictment of of them as

3986
03:24:44,159 --> 03:24:49,535
I mean I think this whole deposition is really just a horrific portrait of how they work

3987
03:24:49,791 --> 03:24:50,815
Internally

3988
03:24:53,631 --> 03:24:57,983
That's mind-boggling to me absolutely mind-boggling to me

3989
03:24:58,495 --> 03:24:59,519
How is it

3990
03:25:00,287 --> 03:25:03,103
That you have been on these cases

3991
03:25:03,871 --> 03:25:05,663
For so f****** long

3992
03:25:06,175 --> 03:25:07,967
As one of Infowars as lawyers

3993
03:25:08,735 --> 03:25:10,527
But at no point in time did you think

3994
03:25:10,783 --> 03:25:13,599
Man we should really explain the kitten not to tell the truth

3995
03:25:15,135 --> 03:25:21,279
Or not try to give up everything

3996
03:25:21,535 --> 03:25:27,679
I think that this is an acceptable way to act I don't think so I think this I think it didn't know any better

3997
03:25:27,935 --> 03:25:28,447
Risen

3998
03:25:28,959 --> 03:25:32,287
Direct he couldn't recognize the roads he was being walk down

3999
03:25:32,543 --> 03:25:33,567
And I think

4000
03:25:33,823 --> 03:25:34,335
Vet

4001
03:25:34,847 --> 03:25:37,663
I think that comes back to that naivete and I think

4002
03:25:37,919 --> 03:25:39,199
I think that the

4003
03:25:39,455 --> 03:25:42,015
Dominus in the stupidity that he manifests

4004
03:25:42,271 --> 03:25:44,063
Comes out in a lot of ways

4005
03:25:44,575 --> 03:25:47,903
With him not recognizing some of the stuff that he's reporting is completely

4006
03:25:48,159 --> 03:25:49,695
Batshit and nonsense

4007
03:25:49,951 --> 03:25:54,047
And then the naivete comes he doesn't realize

4008
03:25:54,303 --> 03:26:00,447
Like where these questions are leaving Adventurer Vines to be like this you're weird weird

4009
03:26:00,703 --> 03:26:06,847
The conversation not having very much a dude who is just operated tea or Lyon

4010
03:26:07,103 --> 03:26:11,711
I'd like reward or punishment scale his entire life where they

4011
03:26:11,967 --> 03:26:15,807
If I don't ask these questions I get a reward they give me a bonus

4012
03:26:16,063 --> 03:26:22,207
How many might as well get $15,000 a year to not ask questions about this I wouldn't be surprised if that

4013
03:26:24,767 --> 03:26:27,839
And then he's a butt into I just

4014
03:26:28,351 --> 03:26:29,375
This is

4015
03:26:29,631 --> 03:26:30,399
Soul

4016
03:26:30,655 --> 03:26:31,935
F****** sad that is

4017
03:26:32,191 --> 03:26:33,215
It is so sad

4018
03:26:33,471 --> 03:26:36,799
It's a bummer all around I think I think it's a bummer because

4019
03:26:37,311 --> 03:26:38,591
This is obviously

4020
03:26:38,847 --> 03:26:42,431
Far from the only example of stories that

4021
03:26:42,943 --> 03:26:45,247
Get his shanked

4022
03:26:45,503 --> 03:26:48,319
It's just the one where someone talked to sue them and

4023
03:26:49,343 --> 03:26:49,855
It's

4024
03:26:51,391 --> 03:26:55,999
There's also a depressing aspect of it that is

4025
03:26:56,255 --> 03:27:00,607
From the beginning of it work this is the only person we've ever seen who has had any

4026
03:27:01,119 --> 03:27:07,263
Discernible sense that they need to do better in response to this negative feedback early

4027
03:27:07,519 --> 03:27:09,055
And it also doesn't matter

4028
03:27:09,823 --> 03:27:15,967
You know it's it's because of utility too if it comes out weird

4029
03:27:16,223 --> 03:27:18,527
Not weird I think one of the things that makes it

4030
03:27:19,039 --> 03:27:21,343
Easier to feel sympathy for kit

4031
03:27:21,855 --> 03:27:23,135
Is just because

4032
03:27:23,391 --> 03:27:29,535
Regardless of his whatever relative intelligence or or Preparation or anything along

4033
03:27:30,047 --> 03:27:31,583
He's just not equipped

4034
03:27:31,839 --> 03:27:33,119
To handle a conversation like

4035
03:27:33,631 --> 03:27:39,775
Yeah what do you mean some gas in his bag of

4036
03:27:40,031 --> 03:27:41,311
Of abilities and so

4037
03:27:41,823 --> 03:27:45,407
The problem here is that bill could not be more equipped

4038
03:27:45,919 --> 03:27:52,063
Right so it's it's very much a f****** night on a horse with a lance against

4039
03:27:52,319 --> 03:27:55,135
A dude holding his underwears over his head

4040
03:27:56,415 --> 03:27:56,927
And it's like

4041
03:27:57,183 --> 03:28:01,279
That's not fair even if it was Hitler holding his underwear over his head

4042
03:28:01,535 --> 03:28:03,327
You be like well this isn't a fair fight

4043
03:28:03,583 --> 03:28:09,727
I want Hitler to die but I mean this is just kind of excessive right

4044
03:28:09,983 --> 03:28:16,127
And I think I think that's the other difficult part is the keeping in mind

4045
03:28:16,639 --> 03:28:21,503
Well metaphorically yeah it's like how much sympathy do you really

4046
03:28:21,759 --> 03:28:23,551
Leave to expand for someone

4047
03:28:24,063 --> 03:28:30,207
Who is in a situation where he's way in over his head but also is part of it

4048
03:28:30,463 --> 03:28:30,975
Toxic

4049
03:28:31,231 --> 03:28:37,375
Horrible infrastructure has led to so many people being hurt

4050
03:28:37,631 --> 03:28:43,775
Ultimately ultimately what we're watching is nothing is not a beat down or anything like that it is a Man simply receive

4051
03:28:44,031 --> 03:28:49,663
Consequences for his actions

4052
03:28:49,919 --> 03:28:56,063
Calling audible Isaac we should split this into two episodes

4053
03:28:56,319 --> 03:29:00,671
I think that we you should join us Friday for the Owen Shroyer.

4054
03:29:01,183 --> 03:29:07,327
Frankly we're at three and a half hours or so right now and if we do and on I don't know what the

4055
03:29:07,583 --> 03:29:08,863
What kind of time we're going to be at

4056
03:29:09,119 --> 03:29:15,263
I appreciate that our listeners do enjoy long episode do yeah but we have our limits and I think it's

4057
03:29:15,519 --> 03:29:21,663
Prospect of a 6 hour episode is too much for anybody little taxing so

4058
03:29:21,919 --> 03:29:26,783
Is a bait-and-switch but I assure you Friday we will pay off with the old

4059
03:29:27,039 --> 03:29:30,367
The headliner

4060
03:29:30,623 --> 03:29:32,159
I think

4061
03:29:32,927 --> 03:29:33,439
I think

4062
03:29:33,695 --> 03:29:35,231
Weird

4063
03:29:35,743 --> 03:29:36,511
Pinky say

4064
03:29:36,767 --> 03:29:42,911
You say just about everything you need to say about this deposition by playing it and then also say

4065
03:29:45,215 --> 03:29:51,359
There's a bit of analysis some stuff out but I think it really speaks for itself

4066
03:29:51,615 --> 03:29:52,895
I've been a lot of ways of just like

4067
03:29:53,407 --> 03:29:59,551
This is the level of care that is given when you're reporting something that has the potential

4068
03:29:59,807 --> 03:30:00,575
2

4069
03:30:01,087 --> 03:30:02,879
Drastically impact people's lives

4070
03:30:03,135 --> 03:30:04,927
Totally

4071
03:30:05,183 --> 03:30:06,719
Don't care until there's

4072
03:30:06,975 --> 03:30:08,767
They don't want to

4073
03:30:09,023 --> 03:30:10,815
I mean it used is just

4074
03:30:11,071 --> 03:30:12,607
So much of like

4075
03:30:13,375 --> 03:30:17,983
Children they're just children nobody ever explained like that

4076
03:30:18,239 --> 03:30:18,751
Hot

4077
03:30:19,007 --> 03:30:20,031
Hot stuff

4078
03:30:20,287 --> 03:30:23,871
Well and I can teach when other people touch it hurts

4079
03:30:24,127 --> 03:30:28,735
So don't touch

4080
03:30:28,991 --> 03:30:35,135
So we will be back Jordan Hindi we will her another little glimpse into the deposition world

4081

World of Alex Jones Coronavirus

4082
