1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,872
A little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,640
Jordan

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,968
What was the last Wild

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:25,344
Last wild animal wild bird

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,928
Farah

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,488
No no I mean like in the forest

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
Like I was in a forest

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,032
One night I was at a comedy

10
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
Michelle

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
Fullerton

12
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,040
I don't know the cross street

13
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,344
I was smoking a cigarette pretty drunk

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
After the show

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
Walking down the street but a

16
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
Swear to God

17
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
Walking down the street

18
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Casually

19
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
Just walking out like

20
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Isn't

21
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Super uncommon

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,080
Wilson coyotes

23
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
You'll see

24
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Summer things also confirmed it was it was

25
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Is a wolf walking down Fullerton

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,096
I just am already defensive my wolf sighting

27
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Poinciana wolf in Chicago

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Who's crazy

29
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Longer goes on as a kid

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
Like a camping

31
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
I saw a moose

32
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,088
It's almost forever one freak the f*** out

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
For this moose

34
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
Yeah we had to run and get in our liked minivans because my parents were scared of what the most could do

35
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Names of moose were like

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
Was threat

37
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
Think it f*** you up

38
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
In the van

39
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
To see it from a closed

40
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
In the relative safety of a car

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Pretty cool

42
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
Yeah yeah yeah

43
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
Also I've been thinking lately about getting

44
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Exotic pets

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,376
Either that or just quitting the podcast becoming a park ranger wanted to

46
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,216
Just walking around with one of the Iguana and how much I like

47
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,288
Plants and animals

48
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,896
As I get older in life I kind of am realizing like I really like animals

49
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
I really like playing

50
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
Maybe I should just be around them more

51
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,856
Did you just really hate this place I think so

52
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,952
Yeah it's probably something we should bring up

53
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Keep my personal life

54
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Kind of personal

55
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Complaining on the show

56
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,472
About Alex or people were lying for a living

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
Listen to the shonos I had to move

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
In April and moved into a new apartment

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
And almost immediately

60
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
For the last 3 months

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
I have had

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Credibly

63
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Disturbed

64
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
Because of this place

65
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
The neighbors have

66
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,672
It's been incredibly loud the guy upstairs

67
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Just like my

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Play Shake

69
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
When he walks around

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
It's very it's very difficult

71
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
And the sower

72
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,520
That's the long and short of it

73
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,384
I am going to have to move again I hope there won't be any disruption

74
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
Interrupt

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
The podcast

76
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
I think it might go a little smoother than

77
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
Time possibly

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Things could go very wrong

79
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
And we will see

80
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
But

81
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
In the next couple weeks

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Thirlby

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
Some interruptions

84
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
Possibly hopefully not but possibly just to give you a little warning in

85
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
It's crucial

86
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
Cuz I have to get out of here

87
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Some days

88
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Almost nothing

89
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
We keep doing this year

90
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
I'm running on fumes

91
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Today's weather

92
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
It's just it's incredibly insane

93
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Various

94
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
Noise pollution aspect

95
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
But hopefully

96
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
Soak sorry if we missing episodes coming up

97
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
But

98
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
I also not sorry

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Hey I at the end

100
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
Yeah you got to get the

101
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Is it like

102
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Difficult because

103
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Well off

104
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
And so

105
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Expenses

106
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
It's a challenge

107
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
I really

108
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Stress enough how much I appreciate

109
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
The sport of people who

110
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751

112
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799

Able to

114
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Play swear I won't go crazy with it

115
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
And so in honor of that let us take a moment

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247

Why you pimp so good

136
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039

You donated for elevated Levelland

140
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655

Amanat Ali Aprilia someone sodomites

143
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
I don't want

144
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
How to read

145
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
I am out of control

146
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
I bet you money are few living black people

147
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
Abused by white people

148
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
Joseph Stalin

149
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Scott

150
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:57,951
I'm cutting off the part where does the Bernie Sanders impressionist

151
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,303
So much Sam really appreciate it and

152
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:09,727
That's what I feel

153
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,799
Website

154
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Support the show

155
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
We would

156
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,199
Sojourn what we're doing today is we've got at July 7th

157
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
+ 8

158
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
20 nights

159
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
All right what are the check-in of the present-day and I felt

160
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
The audience would not let us all

161
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Off the hook if we didn't

162
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
Because of big breaking news in the world

163
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Particularly the arrest

164
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,863
Jeffrey Epstein

165
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Particularly interest

166
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Covering up because I

167
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Leave their media Outlets

168
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
They can do that much

169
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
More

170
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Precisely

171
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Better than I can

172
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
I'm also not particularly interested in covering

173
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Alex's version of it

174
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
One of the main reason

175
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,551
Is because all he does is talk about how Trump never hung out with him

176
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
And Jeffrey Epstein

177
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Just friends

178
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
The Clinton

179
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
I don't care

180
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
To respond to that

181
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Because then it becomes this

182
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
Game of Life

183
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Is this

184
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
I honestly think this is good

185
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Researches

186
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Weak sometimes

187
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
I think the

188
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
I took him like this

189
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Is a little bit beyond my paygrade

190
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
And I don't trust

191
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
That we could

192
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Cover it

193
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
With the

194
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Respect

195
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Also not covering it meme

196
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
Smile quote

197
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
Is going to be way lower potion

198
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Quotient

199
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,871
I dipped in here on Sunday

200
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
And I expected

201
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
It's be wall-to-wall

202
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Clinton

203
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Going down really

204
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,087
I did cuz it's such a big piece

205
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Is worldview right there it is

206
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
I thought for sure it would just be

207
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Nothing but apps

208
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Can you talk

209
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
I was shocked to find

210
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
There's not much

211
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
He doesn't talk

212
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Too much about that situation

213
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
He declares Victory and

214
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,287
Claims the trumps not involved

215
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Declare victory

216
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
So Alex is mostly

217
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
Here's how I would describe

218
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
Alex is definitely affected by this

219
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Operating

220
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Off of it

221
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
But it's not a primary Story 4

222
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
He is onto other things

223
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
A lot of it has to do with like

224
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
You know Trump

225
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Is great

226
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
We're so great

227
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Gonzaga

228
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
And I think it leads him

229
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,287
To make a little bit of you know you know that moment

230
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,639
And a Bond movie where the villain says something a little bit too much

231
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,479
Are we are we doing the speech

232
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
Are we giving the the monologue whenever bond is on the on the chopping block

233
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Old game

234
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,743
I think that this might have shades of that to it

235
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
This here's our first clip from July

236
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
I'll say this

237
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
This is

238
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
We have successfully radicalized the president

239
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
President

240
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Especially

241
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
Is the CIA

242
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Define

243
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Michelle's

244
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,719
So I mean whenever you have protestations

245
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
From Alex about like we aren't some sort of radicalizing force it's difficult to hear stuff like that

246
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
You kind of already know it

247
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
You literally know what you're doing

248
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
Yeah you think it's

249
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Good

250
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,407
You know what you're doing people make accusations you were doing this

251
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
You could really do

252
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Disputed that you don't

253
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Agree that it's bad

254
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
You can't

255
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
Disagree that your radicalizing the present

256
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
You just f****** said it yeah

257
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
Whether or not that's true

258
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Weather

259
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Braggadocio

260
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
People usually put

261
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
After radical

262
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Is

263
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Terrorist

264
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Usually that's how people

265
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Will do that

266
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
He's kind of

267
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
Turn the president into a terror

268
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,175
America America

269
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Alex has a justification for

270
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,599
Terrorism is good she has a rationale

271
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
I guess basically

272
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
You know sort of radicalization version of like

273
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
A rubber and glue

274
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,399
Chicken and egg something but here you go

275
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Islamic

276
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
All of it

277
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
So you justify radicalizing the president of the Pentagon and the CIA your attire

278
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,071
Your imaginary enemies being super radical

279
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
To be the worst f****** thing in the world therefore

280
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
If I'm the second worst thing in the world

281
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
That's better than

282
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,799
This doesn't work this is really bad

283
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
Incredibly terrible

284
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
If you accept this line of thinking

285
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,503
Like it rationalizes pretty much anything you could possibly think of doing

286
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Especially

287
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
Your justification

288
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Entirely imaginary

289
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
Right you know what like there's no unless unless your imagination is completely Limited

290
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
That basically means you have carte blanche to do whatever you want

291
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Anytime

292
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
As long as you can come up with some

293
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Lindsay rationalization

294
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Confirm

295
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
This

296
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Because of is somehow worse

297
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Bombshell

298
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
The people were doing this to stop our terrible

299
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Absolutely

300
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
We of course

301
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
We have

302
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
To commit the Holocaust

303
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Because

304
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
The Jews were going to kill 6 million and one of us

305
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
31

306
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,495
I mean he does believe that the globalist

307
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
Orchestrated both sides of World War II

308
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,479
Do a World War

309
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
It wouldn't be as bad as the global world

310
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
People first

311
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Sew-ins

312
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
If we get to Alex

313
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
Clearly indicating that he still believes

314
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
FIFA

315
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Is out there throwing concrete milkshake

316
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Otherwise people will forget that you're supposed to shoot anyone with

317
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Milkshake on

318
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
Write a good portion

319
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
His coverage

320
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
He's trying to because the enemy is so radical we radicalized

321
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,095
Straight why these people that their cancer superrradical

322
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
You talked about Aunt

323
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
So terrible out there there on concrete milkshakes

324
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
So many people have died at those rallies right like a

325
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
So

326
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
But it's interesting because do you know Aunt

327
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Think about it

328
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
And Alex knows why

329
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
The target

330
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Go out

331
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Happen

332
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
Because the police are being

333
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Blackmail

334
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
What were the police being blackmailed

335
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
All of them

336
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
How to share but last year

337
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,591
We got 30 plus pages of secret documents

338
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
Members brother

339
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
For a while

340
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
Soros

341
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
And one level is your

342
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Chop't

343
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
New stamps are going to attack

344
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
Because they're conservative

345
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
Dallas makes perfect sense so far contracts he found online that he's using his justification for

346
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,447
I don't understand what the

347
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
To deny that these are real

348
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Getting

349
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
This b******* and the police know that and so that's why I was blackmailing

350
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
With the information that they can't

351
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
Comment on well I hadn't considered that

352
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
Talking stupid

353
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
So

354
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
Stanley dumb like

355
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,703
Just the idea that there would be contract

356
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
Is stupid

357
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,871
Criminal Enterprise like this supposed to trigger riot

358
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
Like that is what these fake documents

359
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
R4

360
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Did Alex's

361
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Narrative

362
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
The idea

363
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
Luge

364
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,111
Corporation

365
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Alexander Soros

366
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,463
Wood rot f****** contract

367
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,279
That would somehow be by

368
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Is so stupid

369
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
It's so stupid you have to be

370
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Like so detached from reality

371
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
You have to be so far gone

372
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,543
To imagine

373
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
You would just do it without a contract

374
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Jesus

375
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
You know what people like

376
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
Mules and like drug runners

377
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
Goes wrong

378
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,471
Or regulation unemployment

379
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
Contract when you're a rioter you're acting writer who knocks over conservative

380
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
Court of course

381
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
Stupid

382
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
You think about how efficient that system is

383
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,839
You're in you're already in Port for the criminal trial right for you doing all the time

384
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,703
You just go across the hallway to the Civil Court just doing for the

385
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
It's

386
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,639
To directions to because if you're Alexander Soros and you hire some people

387
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Go to start a riot they don't start a riot

388
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
People break their kneecaps like a contract for it to be enforceable

389
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,071
They did not deliver all the work that you

390
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,679
But you got to hire somebody to do the end the contract

391
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,359
As if you just really convince those people to commit the right in the first place all grows out of like anti-communist bullshits

392
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:05,759
Unearth narrative Alex needs to make about how we get the contract because there's Union

393
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
Please or something like that

394
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,647
I have to assume that's coming at some point

395
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Stupid I hate this s***

396
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
Whenever Peter this stuff I just like

397
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
A person listening

398
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
Denying those documents is a must be real like

399
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
I can't imagine how hopeless

400
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
You must be

401
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,335
How far gone you are from reality

402
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Eliza somebody would make you

403
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
President of the

404
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Crazy

405
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
So that you know

406
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Cool

407
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,815
He's also got another complaint about Auntie so that I actually think it's pretty funny

408
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
Squarely under that heading of

409
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Can't use a bullhorn well

410
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
This is another complaint

411
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Light

412
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Aflac

413
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
And then get it going that way

414
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
Fluid

415
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
What is in the burning American flags as we just we're just think in front of a lion

416
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
That masculine thing where you have to help someone light a grill

417
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,496
Credit where credit's due again so Alex follows this up by being like they have every right to burn a flag

418
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,360
You wouldn't expect that position

419
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
Explicitly

420
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
We saying

421
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
Wrong with that burning

422
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
Disgusting

423
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
Repulsive I disagree with it but they have every right to do it

424
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
You do sort of imply that they're just trying to trigger people in

425
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,656
The fighting right now

426
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
You know the flag on fire is trying to bait

427
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
Someone into a fight

428
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
You could make that argument

429
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Implying intention

430
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
Shinzon somebody that maybe they don't have

431
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
But it's certainly much better than

432
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
It should be illegal

433
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
Okay I'll give him a little credit for that

434
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:55,488
Burning Flags cuz it really sounds like he knew he knew he knows exactly what he's

435
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Bullhorn

436
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Flag burning

437
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
Alex Alex is your guy for those

438
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
To know exactly what things

439
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Really

440
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Because

441
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
The news

442
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,128
Not good drinking whiskey

443
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Tito's from time

444
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Okay

445
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
Flag-burning full hornung

446
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
What else

447
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,856
Not like spending time with the kids

448
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392
So you got it that

449
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,232
Not checking into who he's talking to right

450
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
Real good at that

451
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,608
Direct

452
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
Play as we get to the 8th

453
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Because

454
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
Being a little bit here and there it's in his standard deflection are away for the most part

455
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
To talk about how everyone

456
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,112
Start demonic pedophiles

457
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
To the actual

458
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
Feel no compunction about us

459
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Not really talking about it

460
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,656
Alex is mostly interested in someone else

461
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Van Nuys

462
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
July 8th episode

463
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
As a British guy

464
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
Please help

465
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
Just stop by

466
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
Islam assistive

467
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
Trump bleach on his face in the prison

468
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Marked for Death

469
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
For up to a year

470
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:55,808
Trains

471
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
That's a big store

472
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Yeah with me

473
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
That would be

474
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,120
Everywhere

475
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Yeah

476
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
It was

477
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
So this is an amazing display of sloppiness on Alex's Park almost impressive how bad a job is doing good

478
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
The story he's talking about is that a Charlene down

479
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
Who was a fourteen-year-old in the UK

480
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
The police began operating on the assumption that she was most likely

481
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,160
Dad started investigating the case has never been

482
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,024
Investigators believe the Charlene was known to engage in sex acts

483
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
In an alley behind a row of business

484
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
In the township

485
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
She's from the owner

486
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,704
Zayid

487
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
Was arrested for her murder

488
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
With salacious accusation

489
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
Can flying around that there's nobody

490
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,408
Because they put her into the Kebab meat they sold their fast foods

491
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
We'll see

492
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,344
Muhammad Ali was also arrested on charges of helping

493
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Dispose of the body

494
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,232
In 2007 both men were acquitted because there was no evidence that any of this was true

495
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536
Call Charlene

496
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
So took that as

497
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:18,496
Does absolute conclusion read was a place where she was no.

498
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,824
Frequent gossiping tabloid level

499
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:28,224
Thousand and Muhammad were both awarded $250,000

500
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
Compensation for the damage

501
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:36,416
That the botched investigation because of rumors like this this young girl and put her in

502
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Kebab meat

503
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
Yeah I imagine that his restaurant

504
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Flourish

505
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,096
Probably had a little bit of

506
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Difficulty

507
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
There's more to this case that is publicly known even right now

508
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
Is it the story of Charles

509
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,080
Being killed is not true

510
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
Every reason

511
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,736
Hey 2019 Channel 5 made a documentary called the murder of Charlene Downes

512
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Really troubling

513
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Details about the

514
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
That were not known preview

515
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:10,976
For instance the documentary reveals that about a week into the police investigation to Charlene's disappearance

516
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,072
They decided that if they did so they would not return her to her parents

517
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,864
But instead Placer in child protect

518
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Custody

519
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:23,520
Reasons was out for that was that on the day Charlene went missing

520
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:28,128
Her parents invited a pedophile into their home

521
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
The maker of the documentary uncovered a social service report regarding an incident between Charlene

522
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Did you stay with them

523
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
On the day she went missing

524
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
But there aren't a ton of details about the nature of that in

525
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
I'm not entirely sure

526
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Exactly

527
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,768
What why what happened

528
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,608
This wasn't the first instance of the parents allowing abusers

529
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Into their home

530
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,216
Has reported in 2013 that a four-year-old family friend

531
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
Admitted to authorities that it hurt

532
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
And at least six

533
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
Man with criminal conviction

534
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
Sims 4 rape assault or violence

535
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
Heaven visitors in their home

536
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,528
There were tons of warning signs that she was living

537
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,064
In a very unsafe house

538
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,696
Obviously I don't know the details of the case and they're probably few living people who do know

539
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
Exactly what happened

540
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,888
What I can say is that just a very small amount of research would have demonstrated to Alex that these she was murdered and put into

541
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Kabobs

542
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Is bogus

543
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,568
Irresponsible was refuted in a court of law and is still only still repeated B

544
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
Islam agitators

545
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Who don't care about the

546
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
They don't care about what really happened to Victor

547
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,272
They only care about using the appearances of these in

548
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
To demonize their scapegoat population

549
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
And that's what Tommy Robbins

550
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Has been doing

551
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Gears

552
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,256
One of the main groups that is kept the Kabob narrative alive

553
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,840
Any self-respecting person would have accepted

554
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,632
You know that it was bulshit

555
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Was bedl

556
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Vigorous defense

557
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
Wichita me Robinson

558
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Confounded

559
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
They are.

560
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
Deeply responsible for this.

561
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,200
Kick to the Dustbin of history as just

562
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,528
The issue is that they're not making it up out of whole cloth

563
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,880
Right part of it was based on

564
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,720
The guy's name but it was based on a guy who's like a contractor whose

565
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,000
That he overheard

566
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,328
Aida Mohamed talking about it like we killed her and put her in the

567
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Kabob

568
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,656
Whatever investigation

569
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,984
I found that he is a unreliable source of information

570
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Information

571
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
There's nothing

572
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
Confirms this or it anyway

573
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
Lends credibility

574
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
And they uncovered some

575
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,968
Disgruntled business relation

576
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,320
And the guys who ran this fast food restaurants

577
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,416
There were some indications that he would have a reason

578
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
To create salacious

579
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Just rumors about them based on

580
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
Prior working

581
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,864
Relations edl takes that

582
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
Insist that it must be true as opposed

583
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
To Be Wild

584
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
There's nothing really to back this up that is

585
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
There's

586
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,384
A lot of other information that looks pretty f*****-up about the

587
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
This case maybe we shouldn't use this

588
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
As a banner

589
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Seems like all we're doing is being

590
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
Racist to s*** like all they were doing was being racist

591
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Sister ship

592
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
That's kind of because that is what they would do

593
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
Okay so what they were doing was being racist

594
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
The s*** and that's why

595
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
Looked like what they were doing

596
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
Is a real f****** tragedy

597
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Because

598
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
The reality of this situation

599
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Tubi

600
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Oh really

601
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
You know terrifying

602
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Encased

603
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Child neglect

604
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
Did abuse

605
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,784
And instead of dealing with it on

606
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Demerits

607
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,856
Turn off the information

608
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
You know you just

609
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Move the guilt over to

610
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
To the party that you want to blame

611
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
It's disrespectful to evict

612
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
It's disrespect

613
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
People who

614
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
Yeah

615
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,240
Tommy Robinson in don't care

616
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
They do not care

617
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
The co-opting victim

618
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
Will use energy

619
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
Application

620
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Play wolf

621
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,648
Under the under the radar under the surf

622
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Like the cruelty

623
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Torrid

624
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
People

625
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
Muslim

626
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
That's very overt

627
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
And very visible

628
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,400
But just underneath that is a cruel to eat

629
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
People who are survivors

630
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,240
Because the coop

631
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Using

632
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:45,408
They're actually in order to demonize absolutely larger Muslim population

633
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
Because if you spent

634
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Any of the

635
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Time

636
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Effort

637
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
And resources that you put towards

638
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Demonizing Muslims

639
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Towards

640
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
Helping victims of abuse like

641
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
Maybe

642
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
People wouldn't you know

643
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
Maybe you keep a few people from

644
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Actively

645
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
Hurting people along with diverting

646
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Any attention

647
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
To what really could be fixed

648
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Right

649
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Xenophobic in ethnic

650
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Bass

651
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,200
Demagoguery is not the solution

652
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
2

653
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
The problems of crimes

654
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Against children

655
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Right nothing solution

656
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,208
To anything other than a Jeopardy question for what Trump is doing

657
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Be all Tommy Robinson

658
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
It does

659
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
So f*** him

660
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
So

661
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:41,984
I guess there's one clip of stuff about Epstein that all play and it's just because

662
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
This is

663
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
This is insane

664
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
Like the idea

665
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,536
I don't I don't particularly care to be like

666
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,864
Categorically that's not true let's look at the other end

667
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:14,240
Alex is just repeating

668
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,312
That is not good that is not a good source of

669
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
He's not your

670
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
Spiraling out of control talking about how

671
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
The last

672
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Are vampires

673
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Are we

674
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Apparel

675
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Okay

676
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,936
Children

677
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
That's just the blood libel

678
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Yeah

679
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
Interesting

680
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,112
They say that we put them in cages and we're Nazis now let me

681
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
Mirror pieces

682
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
Nazi propaganda

683
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Hey dude

684
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Calm down

685
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
I do I just did

686
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,656
I hate I hate some of this stuff is important like it

687
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Really insane

688
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
The level is

689
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
Stupidity Vuitton display here

690
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,616
Like responsible

691
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
Detestable

692
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
It leads people into

693
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Same

694
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
Stupidity

695
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
The dumb f****** beliefs

696
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
They are

697
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
But it's also boring

698
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,048
To be an opportunity for us to do a deconstruction of

699
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,888
Historical roots of the blood libel

700
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
How

701
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
Far it's gotten

702
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Cuz

703
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
We're listening to this

704
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
And we're like

705
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
Literally saying that people are drinking f****** blood

706
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,368
Somebody eating a f****** child

707
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,184
And all of this

708
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
Naked over it

709
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:17,632
Going out in public to a large audience

710
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
And we're over it

711
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,592
Things that by degrees I think we've become so descent

712
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
The ties to stop headaches

713
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,712
I think most right-thinking people could hear all

714
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,016
Of the clips that we play if you like

715
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
Fukkit this dude is crazy

716
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,256
It makes sense if you understand why

717
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
Elizabeth

718
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,912
I'll just make a twist excessive talking about here's the roots

719
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,472
Here's why you saying what do you say it doesn't make it

720
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Make sense or good

721
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
Existed

722
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Yeah

723
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
But it also is

724
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Is just

725
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Play recently

726
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
They're like

727
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,576
So you guys don't allow Alex

728
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Speakers.

729
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,392
Do you cut him out of contacts and that

730
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,928
Kind of stuff sure do

731
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
You need to

732
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
Okay

733
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,096
We can't even begin to describe how much

734
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
Context we have given this matter

735
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
I can't even breathe

736
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Jim to describe

737
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Who's one of the principals when I started I was bummed out by

738
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,480
In context cuz context makes him worse

739
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
So not only

740
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
Do liberals

741
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,464
Drink

742
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Liberal

743
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
Beautiful things

744
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Destroyed

745
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Sure

746
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Ridgeland

747
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,760
Institutionalized

748
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
Almost like he's talking about Integracore

749
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,096
It's almost like he watched something about Munchausen by proxy

750
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
Just in cases

751
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
More s*** talk

752
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
Liberal

753
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
And

754
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
The flight unpacking

755
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
As much as

756
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
You know life just come

757
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
From cursed bloodlines

758
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
Yep it seems like so much of his

759
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,008
Distinction of who is an

760
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Leftist

761
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Comes down

762
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
2

763
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
Issues of

764
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
Race

765
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
There's so much of the

766
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
JW stuff is being

767
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
And Alex's world it's difficult to hear him

768
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,184
Did whatever you talk about blood

769
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
He just

770
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
You go fart

771
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
You close to

772
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,912
Stuff that look if you if you come from curse bloodline

773
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
You're not

774
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
.

775
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
Done

776
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
It's like a Sci-Fi novel

777
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,408
Another reality

778
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
You got this.

779
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
If you say that

780
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,184
I really think whatever you talk about Bloodlines at all

781
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Your

782
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
You're in trouble

783
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,048
You're already past the point where it's like

784
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Are you going to say some

785
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,400
Something good cuz you're not

786
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,960
I've ever heard bloodline

787
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Discuss

788
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:12,128
Like here's a contact for a benign bloodline

789
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Thanks

790
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,296
Oh yeah and my family's history our bloodline has shown very patrician nose

791
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Is a

792
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Common

793
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,024
Yeah I don't know if you can do this

794
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
Oh boy

795
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:36,448
There is no way to say bloodline without

796
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
I feel like it

797
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,080
Territory I'm not positive anyone can really never

798
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,176
Marathon

799
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
So in this next clip Alex

800
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
You know

801
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
You got a lot of a lot of things

802
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Things working again

803
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
You know you got the world

804
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
World government

805
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
You got the leftist

806
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792
Antifa out there you got Elvis

807
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Eating human kabobs

808
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Right

809
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
No

810
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
Another enemy of all World churches

811
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
Devils

812
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
So

813
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
I mean

814
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,704
I don't I don't know how to look at this other than

815
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
Just like a direct

816
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
Extension of all of his

817
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
Like destroying

818
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
An impudent

819
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,616
Any kind of

820
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,176
Agreed upon reality

821
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,736
You know like anything's gives

822
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
50 Cent

823
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
Community that isn't

824
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
Connected to his crazy worldview

825
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
Must be attacked

826
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
In some way

827
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,792
Any kind of popular culture that we all share like we talked about

828
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,632
Clarett or whatever that program

829
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:15,520
I guess we won't talk about that I like to go to my church where all my friends cookout

830
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:21,920
Do you know that

831
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,272
Where am I going to get involved in local politics

832
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,648
Has been great for me

833
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:36,512
There is nothing that doesn't every single thing

834
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,072
About his rhetoric in his world

835
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
You to isolate from everything

836
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,216
Things that are tacitly or explicitly approved by Alex

837
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Which are almost

838
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
Exclusively

839
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
Bigotry related

840
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
Militia

841
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,895
I think you like the movie Independence

842
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,455
Daiso

843
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,247
His book right

844
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Welcome To Earth

845
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
Come on

846
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
I would say probably

847
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
Thinks he's a globalized

848
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
Probably

849
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
Maybe

850
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,975
Galaxy problems

851
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Empire of some sort

852
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Is he a Scientologist

853
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,167
I don't know I remembered all the rumors but it never interest

854
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Stood me all that much

855
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
I never really looked at

856
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,775
Next Corp

857
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
You know like they're f******

858
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Devil

859
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
Running of the world's churches

860
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Yeah

861
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
Ism is everywhere

862
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
As evidence

863
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,831
Next

864
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
So how his voice lilt

865
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,719
Okay so f****** condescend okay this is amazing

866
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,535
On your face

867
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,887
New York

868
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,759
What's 666

869
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
This is a safe

870
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
Saudia 606

871
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
Six pieces of glasses where that real sucking condescending tone came out not true

872
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,655
Look at him

873
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,191
He didn't do and I'm just

874
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Hallelujah

875
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,287
Remember if you suspect

876
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
Donut conspiracy

877
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
Recite that aren't true

878
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
Building isn't dedicated

879
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,039
What room is the building includes a sculpture that is provided by funding from the aleutians trust

880
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,951
Grew out of a company called the Lucifer publishing cup

881
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,559
Okay for a couple years and I was like 20 years before the UN

882
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
Confounded

883
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,399
The people behind the Lucius trustworthy Asif

884
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
Back in the early Knights

885
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
1800

886
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
And as such they had approached

887
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
The name Lucifer publishing company was likely chosen

888
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
Because we like bringing connotation of lucid

889
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
For within this circle

890
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
The time

891
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,807
And the name Lucius trust was chosen as a replacement because it contains the Latin root word meaning

892
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,367
Lights it doesn't evoke images of the devil in

893
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
People

894
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,951
The keep the enlightening meaning of their name

895
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
Avoid people thinking they worship the literal Chris

896
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,863
They were doing such a good job at first they were like

897
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Lucifer

898
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
People are really

899
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,639
Yeah unfortunately they were wrong about changing their name

900
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,967
People still like literally

901
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,015
Kristen Bell

902
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,511
This is just made up to a completely inaccurate

903
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
The Justified

904
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
All this just serves that exact

905
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Text same

906
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Function

907
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
It's just it's just

908
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
Justification of radicalization

909
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
That's all this is

910
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Destruction

911
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
Just like

912
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
It's believed

913
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:17,439
Go to the Loo yeah I go to the movies just got to be sucking walking into things

914
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
It's beautiful

915
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,607
He loves the Renaissance right

916
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
The devil real

917
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
About how Trump is the good guy

918
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
The Border

919
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
Naoc suck

920
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,615
I think Carrie has a little bit of a racist voice

921
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
You decide

922
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
Media

923
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Cheaper

924
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,023
I mean what are you going to do about it

925
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:31,679
They're like the people who are against Trump are killing kids every 5 minutes and torturing them in order to gain

926
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,519
Spiritual demonic power in order to overthrow the United States

927
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
Like he's so close to

928
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,895
To Steven Kelly the guy who wants to store with a Getty Museum

929
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
Cuz Big Daddy

930
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
Alien base underneath it

931
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,527
Save the theme s***

932
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,063
Well that's because

933
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,927
Alex Jones has entered the territory of Z creepiest

934
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Darius

935
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:59,071
Dude I've ever seen on Project Camelot

Like really f****** close to a guy who I've watched a bunch of his videos and I like we can cover this

937
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,287

938
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Jesus

939
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Guys

00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
Just leaving

941
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,479
You want to eat children at the border

942
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
Disincentivize

943
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
People that come

944
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
Just

945
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
Say it

946
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,927
We don't bother with all this

947
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Demons

948
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,999
You you're the bad guys

949
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,583
You think you're doing it in service of a larger good I guess but

950
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,911
Just admit that you're

951
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,055
Bad this is an objectively bad thing but I will

952
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
That

953
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
I don't know everything about the

954
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
And should

955
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
Alexandria ocasio-cortez

956
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
Go down to the Border

957
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
Then

958
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,295
Sprouts

959
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,623
I'm willing to amend my position

960
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
I agree

961
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
Now you're right

962
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,959
Keep you updated on whether or not

963
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:14,079
Alexandria ocasio-cortez becomes a demon

964
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:19,455
Still no couple hours

965
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:24,063
Racist or not racist don't know

966
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
I couldn't hear

967
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,439
To whom it was being racist felt like it drifted a little in

968
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,719
To Tuscany

969
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,559
Cookies very good

970
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,607
Football

971
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
Twisted Tiffany

972
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,167
Is there 28

973
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,447
It was a very racist

974
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
It was

975
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Clunky

976
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:48,127
That should be your family crest

977
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,711
So he gets into the second hour

978
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Is

979
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,599
He decides he's going to hand over the show to Tommy Robinson

980
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,391
No because Tommy

981
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
Something big

982
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:04,255
Going on you will be soon

983
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,815
Robinson is going to have the floor

984
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,887
Rush Hour

985
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
Request the president

986
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
I'll just let him

987
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:29,087
Gyros

988
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Disappear

989
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
Probably got five minutes

990
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
Just watch this

991
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,079
Political emergency

992
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,551
So Tommy Robinson gets an hour on Alex's program too big

993
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,111
The president of the United States for Asylum

994
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
Which is funny

995
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,695
Tommy

996
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Assertive

997
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Begin

998
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,535
His case

999
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
Is Tommy Robinson

1000
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:17,983
It's not it's Stephen yaxley-lennon

1001
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,031
Ministration

1002
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,055
Republican Party

1003
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,663
United States of America

1004
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:31,039
Go fuc yourself

1005
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:37,695
Tommy Robinson

1006
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Because you can f*** right off

1007
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,791
And I've exactly zero interest in even engaging

1008
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,327
With his particular brand of b*******

1009
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,167
He's made a career of xenophobia native nativist agitate

1010
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,959
Lying about very serious issue

1011
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,383
And there's nothing in his pattern behavior any of his actions are carried out good faith

1012
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Ever

1013
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
For some level of con

1014
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:03,807
Last July on a radio show called conversation

1015
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,623
Even Nigel farage tried to explain to

1016
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Steve Bannon

1017
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,743
Who expressed support for everybody

1018
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,839
And even Nigel farage said Tommy did break the law

1019
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
There's something

1020
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
Incredibly hilarious

1021
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
Plan that he's launching gear though

1022
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
Four years Tommy's bait

1023
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,079
Tons of money by demonizing people who fled mortal danger in their home country

1024
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Seek Refuge

1025
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Status of the EU

1026
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
Or the United States

1027
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,223
And now that he's facing a little bit of jail time.

1028
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
Clearly legal action

1029
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:38,111
He's begging the president of the United States intervened in Britain have the very same refugee

1030
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:43,231
She said it was marked as being sincere in the case of Muslims and non-white peoples in the United

1031
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,023
Man you know what that reminds

1032
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,327
Remind people

1033
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
People who are alive

1034
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,703
First Amendment rights no regulation and then

1035
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,079
Those happen to them and they're like President regulating

1036
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
F*** off

1037
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,895
That that is the

1038
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,199
Wolverine irregularly

1039
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
To prison he deserves it

1040
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
My field notes

1041
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
54 mm

1042
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,695
The Queen's Court determined the quote to condone the live broadcast of these

1043
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,767
Defended being aggressively confronted as they arrive for court

1044
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,119
In conjunction with prejudicial commentary exhortation

1045
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,399
Engage entrapment

1046
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,215
It would pose a risk to The Wider interests of the justice

1047
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,263
Which makes sense

1048
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
Encouraging harassment

1049
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,615
The court was on pretty solid footing

1050
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,431
Pull-A-Part in the livestream where Tommy says quote

1051
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:38,527
Him find him go knock on his door follow him

1052
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,087
See what he's doing

1053
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
That

1054
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,415
But like my first check was going to be like

1055
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,743
Harass those people because

1056
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,303
Yeah that's a very obvious

1057
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,631
What it is

1058
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,447
No

1059
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
Over the top

1060
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:07,199
Incorrect don't believe the Tommy brings up this part of his commentary

1061
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,527
Stupid

1062
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,367
It was a legitimate Brie to the justice system call to vigilante

1063
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,183
Even beyond that his actions worked against

1064
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,207
To stated goal

1065
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,095
He pretended he was there to cover Muslim story grooming gang somehow imagined that his livestream would help the prophet

1066
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
I guess

1067
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,679
Without his help the man on trial and sentence

1068
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
To 12 years in prison

1069
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,007
But because of Tommy's interference

1070
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,543
Batman was almost able to

1071
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,615
Appeal his conviction on the grounds that Tommy's livestream

1072
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,199
And the ensuing protests

1073
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,503
What Tommy is doing is illegitimate

1074
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
Answer your threat not only to the larger Muslim Community in the United Kingdom but also to prosecutors are trying to deal with

1075
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Are you Tommy

1076
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
Professors are

1077
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Like legitimately

1078
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,327
He endangered the prosecution of that case

1079
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,375
He brought a camera into the quarter which is it

1080
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Explicitly not allowed

1081
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:02,751
Primarily because you can use the footage you captured and purposes

1082
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,079
You know that encourage the harassment of people like judges arteries

1083
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
Or council member

1084
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,919
There's a very good reason to not allow cameras

1085
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
In court broke that law

1086
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,015
Because of his overwhelming me

1087
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
Pretension

1088
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,831
What is pathological hatred of Muslims

1089
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
You received it

1090
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Suspended sentence

1091
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,999
So if you reoffended while still under that's

1092
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
Suspended sentence

1093
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Andre offend did

1094
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,863
He was given every chance not to

1095
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,399
To be in the situation he's in now

1096
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
The UK courts tried to save him from himself

1097
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,519
As we saw with the lion of London Bridge

1098
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
Yeah well

1099
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Yep

1100
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,127
I definitely wrote sympathy for him being held response

1101
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
No and he's

1102
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,503
This is the situation

1103
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,063
You know when you're when you're talking about Frozen

1104
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,879
Reform is it about Rehabilitation

1105
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Yeah

1106
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
Punishment

1107
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:58,303
What is what is the purpose behind the prison

1108
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
I feel like

1109
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,911
Prison is the wrong place for him what he needs is exile

1110
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:08,287
I pick him out of the Deport him I revoke his UK citizenship status

1111
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,895
I don't know how that would help Sterling would probably leave him

1112
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,711
Using that as of course

1113
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,991
But like yeah

1114
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
As I was

1115
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
Listening to this

1116
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
So the thinking about it I was reflecting on it

1117
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
I don't love incarceration

1118
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
Generally

1119
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:28,255
I don't I don't know what the right answer is for punished

1120
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,791
Sing like this

1121
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,583
I don't know how you deal with

1122
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Someone like him

1123
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,631
Especially someone who

1124
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Has a

1125
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Decade

1126
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
Decade-and-a-half

1127
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:41,567
Lifelong career is it

1128
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,847
Big Brawl

1129
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
Based

1130
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,663
Political activity

1131
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,943
The

1132
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:51,551
The career of xenophobia and agitation

1133
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,855
I do not think that you would be receptive

1134
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
Kind of rehabilitative

1135
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,719
Intervention

1136
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
How does that

1137
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,047
Square with my feelings that I don't think

1138
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
People

1139
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Generally

1140
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Should

1141
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,423
Be in prison

1142
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Only real

1143
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,055
Punishment for these guys would be removing their ability to

1144
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,591
But like their platform

1145
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
Should be completely

1146
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
You know like

1147
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,455
Like with Jim Bakker

1148
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,479
Jim Bakker

1149
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:25,343
Spent his entire career scamming people out of money

1150
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,207
And then when he got out he reformed himself and started

1151
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
Bright

1152
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:36,351
With the Lessons Learned of where the line is

1153
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
But it's like a

1154
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,935
The quote from blow or whatever I want in

1155
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,007
To jail with a and then I went out with

1156
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
A problem for most people

1157
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
Fraud

1158
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:52,991
It's the part where you actually committed a like out-and-out fraud

1159
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
The present

1160
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,111
It's not even respond

1161
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,927
Like he's not going to go in for whatever

1162
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,023
Come out with like

1163
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,839
Push it even farther whenever he gets out

1164
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:15,775
No deal brexit maybe he will have

1165
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
You just do whatever you want

1166
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,103
I don't have any

1167
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
Real feeling

1168
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,943
In about the other

1169
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,551
I would love to see a overhaul of the incarceration

1170
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,343
Can State I would love to see that

1171
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:35,231
Needs to do that their sovereign country they have their laws because

1172
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,303
That operate however they operate the first

1173
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,143
Aha is long

1174
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,191
As long as the prison

1175
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,495
Is where people

1176
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
Are sentenced to

1177
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
For what

1178
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
He did

1179
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,151
I'm not I'm not going to go to bed for

1180
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,223
As long as he's not being held in like solitary confinement

1181
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,759
Or being targeted

1182
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
Specifically for violent attacks

1183
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,135
I don't really I'm not going to cry to your

1184
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,743
I want him to be safe and warm and it's far away from

1185
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
Damage

1186
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,351
As far away from the possibility for him to do.

1187
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,911
Today like

1188
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,935
As long as

1189
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
He's not

1190
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
Being like harmed

1191
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,799
As long as he's not in solitary confinement

1192
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
If you have to spend two years in

1193
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
In prison and that's the only

1194
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
Consequence for all the damage

1195
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
Richie's done in his career

1196
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Getting off

1197
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
Really he's really

1198
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,319
And it just goes to show like

1199
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
This is a natural

1200
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
What's 4

1201
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,975
Chickens come home to roost

1202
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
What do you do

1203
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
You

1204
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Beg

1205
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,071
Trump

1206
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:48,191
And if there's one if anybody listens

1207
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Take away one

1208
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,287
Do not ever give these guys

1209
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Even this

1210
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,591
Slightest benefit of the doubt

1211
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,871
If you're going to sue

1212
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:01,503
I'd go all the way and asked for a goddamn

1213
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
Destroy these guys

1214
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
I really hate this

1215
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,391
I hate this s*** and I hate the show

1216
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:13,791
It's legit most of the show

1217
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:20,191
Rambling on and misrepresenting his case completely different

1218
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
Much less patience

1219
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,591
At least Alex is the target of my enter

1220
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,455
Talkingshit for an hour it is boring

1221
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
It might be something in there that's like

1222
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
That's an interesting

1223
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,599
Thought gives me a greater context

1224
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,623
What Alex

1225
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
Snopes

1226
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:46,047
There's nothing that he could say in the course of this hour that will interest

1227
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
Whatever you would like

1228
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,935
So Alex has a plan

1229
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
Getaround

1230
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:01,151
Here's what it is

1231
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
Paternalism

1232
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,599
Inside

1233
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:14,719
Prior convictions works for journalism

1234
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,255
The cop

1235
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:22,655
Girlfriend

1236
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
Had some cocaine

1237
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,727
If you got in trouble for having a fake

1238
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
Passport

1239
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:31,615
And mortgage fraud

1240
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:36,223
He's a career f****** criminal creative nonfiction

1241
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
He's got the rest

1242
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
Super Broly

1243
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Use a

1244
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,391
Yeah really is

1245
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
Uniform

1246
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,023
Uniformly if you any right-thinking person

1247
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
Would know that he's a piece of

1248
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:55,167
And it's not right

1249
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
Is whether or not

1250
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,775
That's pretty good

1251
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
Sort of

1252
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,639
A good just general personality test

1253
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,735
Step if you like Tom Robinson

1254
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,807
You believe that ship

1255
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
So

1256
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
I do

1257
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
Care at all

1258
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
I don't care

1259
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,559
I don't care

1260
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,351
Tommy Robinson deserves go to prison

1261
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,215
If I sound like way the police decide to give him another shot or whatever the courts

1262
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
Society

1263
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,287
Alright we're going to give you another suspended sentence

1264
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
I also don't care about that

1265
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,871
Go to prison

1266
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,431
Like I would love for him to stop being a s*******

1267
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,527
I don't think prisons going to solve that problem

1268
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,087
I don't think I'm not going by problem

1269
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,391
He's going to be probably no matter what

1270
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
It doesn't matter

1271
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,487
2zz propagandist with bad faith

1272
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,047
He just is a

1273
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,655
Have us all on the road to Tarsus

1274
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,447
Moment where you realize it

1275
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,591
Oh God this whole career was brought into the world

1276
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,871
Right but he never will

1277
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,895
No I don't care

1278
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
When Alex

1279
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,503
Probably Carol little bit if

1280
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,063
Asylum

1281
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:21,695
I don't think that's going to happen development I think it starts

1282
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:24,767
To get a little bit more interested in this

1283
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
Just

1284
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
I don't give a

1285
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
That would be why

1286
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,143
That would be

1287
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:36,287
Do you know how ridiculous international version of pardoning Arpaio

1288
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Really

1289
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,407
It's an internet National

1290
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:47,295
Waiting to happen even f****** farraj doesn't like tummy Robin

1291
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:53,951
That's why I that's why I could start getting more involved with youth camp once for

1292
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:59,071
Raj started the authority

1293
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,119
Just wild to think

1294
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,911
The UK bigger community

1295
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,191
Multitude

1296
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,471
But even people who don't like

1297
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,263
Like each other

1298
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:10,079
15 different accents in London

1299
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
So I don't care

1300
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
I don't care

1301
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,687
Okay

1302
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
No

1303
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,807
I don't

1304
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,367
Give us

1305
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,975
But it's interesting to me that I would scare so much

1306
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,999
Yeah that is

1307
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,023
It's not really

1308
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,559
I only doing this to set up

1309
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
Clip

1310
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,935
Alex care so much to take over his chauffeur an hour

1311
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,727
But he doesn't care that much

1312
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
Cuz he's got another guy

1313
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
Yes coming up

1314
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:56,159
He's cutting

01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,463
Carpe donktum

1316
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
Carpe donktum

1317
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:06,655
Who makes memes I don't know

1318
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,703

1319
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Ramen

Use the dog

1321
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,311

Let me stay up till 3 in the morning researching

1327
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,319
Leo zagami

1328
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
How about car

1329
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,463
Kerouac

1330
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,023
Ticking Toby Robinson

1331
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
Because he's got carp

1332
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,375
Here's what I know about Carpe donktum

1333
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
He makes memes

1334
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,239
He apparently wanted in forward meme competition

1335
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,799
And Trump retweeted that me

1336
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:51,711
What is pretty much royalty world

1337
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,039
I don't know how much veracity there is today

1338
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
Because the world is so

1339
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Yeah

1340
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:02,719
I believe anything

1341
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Speech

1342
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Internet

1343
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
The people who you invited

1344
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,311
Of course meeting of the minds

1345
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,871
True or not because the bigger issue is

1346
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,663
It makes so much sense

1347
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
It could be true

1348
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,479
Yeah that's the world that we are living

1349
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,015
Yeah yeah

1350
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,343
This is the dumbest I sound like a broken record but I don't

1351
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,391
What's he got to say

1352
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Not a lot

1353
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975
Does he have a new

1354
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,279
Does he have a meme

1355
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:43,679
Is this like a new album to talk about now

1356
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,007
He also is apparently

1357
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,799
Thinking about starting a website

1358
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,871
I heard that

1359
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,687
Why don't you have a f****** website already

1360
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,503
Handsome

1361
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,783
The president

1362
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:04,159
Do you have your f******

1363
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,463
Scams that you're running

1364
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,815
Patreon 2

1365
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
Nobody donators

1366
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,751
Always surprised

1367
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
When I see you

1368
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,055
People who are in this

1369
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Scam world

1370
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:26,431
Who aren't doing a good job monetizing their scam

1371
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:32,319
Stand is there people who think that there's sincerity involved at like

1372
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,879
I don't know I don't know

1373
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,903
I think it probably

1374
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,695
Maybe comes down to ambivalence

1375
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,511
Not knowing exactly the steps

1376
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
You're supposed to take

1377
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
But

1378
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,399
Looking to the right places maybe like

1379
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
A lot of that money is coming

1380
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,215
And somewhere else

1381
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:53,311
Describe star account that has a ton more donors and I just looked at the patreon

1382
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,871
I don't know

1383
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Who gives a s***

1384
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,687
F****** care but a

1385
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Meme guy

1386
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Coming on

1387
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,039
Alex's show

1388
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:07,391
Hey we didn't get invited to the social-media thing and look where I'm at about it

1389
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
What about about it

1390
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:11,999
We got f****** Carpe donktum he's going to be there

1391
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,815
There's kind of a passive-aggressive thing going on yeah

1392
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,351
It's not super

1393
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Stream

1394
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,447
It sometimes is about to die it's not

1395
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,983
It's not as overt

1396
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
No but it's

1397
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
You can see

1398
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,335
Feel it still

1399
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,383
Trying to

1400
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Make right

1401
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
The fact that they didn't

1402
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,735
It's

1403
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
Whatever it is f****** lame and I

1404
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
I don't

1405
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:39,903
I sound like a f****** broken record but I don't care I don't care

1406
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,207
I know.

1407
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
I don't even like you saying those were

1408
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,863
What is real name

1409
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
Don't give a s***

1410
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
So he's talking to

1411
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,495
My bad Docs

1412
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
And

1413
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,615
In the middle that conversation Alex brings back up Tommy Robbins

1414
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,663
Play in order to make this

1415
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,455
Situation seems so much more severe than

1416
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,535
Brother

1417
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
He has created a false

1418
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,423
Version of what time you getting in trouble for to present to the audience

1419
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
To make it appear that

1420
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
Just because

1421
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:33,151
Bear point out those lumps are committing crimes

1422
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Titleist does

1423
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:39,807
Sure Carpe donktum

1424
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,391
That it's insane

1425
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,183
Next year when you find out that

1426
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,463
In the late 80s

1427
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
DJ Envy

1428
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:52,863
I don't think he's old enough

1429
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,191
I don't think Carpe donktum is old enough

1430
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
Look at that mold

1431
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
I just

1432
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,823
I'll be more disappointed when

1433
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,615
Pence drops out

1434
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,639
Trump

1435
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
Donktum

1436
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,199
Tony Plumbing

1437
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,295
And I'll look the fool

1438
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,367
Far-left believable

1439
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,927
I wish that that were so out there I could

1440
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,207
Could never ever under

1441
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,767
Understand it but I swear to God if

1442
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
Just chooses

1443
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,327
Meme

1444
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,887
Not even not even Carpe donktum

1445
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,935
Prairie supposed to work

1446
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:31,007
He's just going to hold up a meme next to him while he's given

1447
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,311
That that

1448
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,359
Would make as much sense as any f******

1449
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
Nasher

1450
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,455
Alex

1451
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,015
It is the last clip

1452
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
She just talked to Carpe

1453
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
More

1454
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
This just

1455
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,487
Set up this clip but it just really can

1456
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,007
Smart Cookie

1457
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
What that mean

1458
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,711
Is that true

1459
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
Preparing

1460
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,143
So he's having these people come to the White House

1461
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,959
As if it's some sort of Willy Wonka

1462
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,519
Let's find the snitch game

1463
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,919
Breakaway

1464
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:45,503
Correctly

1465
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:50,111
I think what he saying to start with is that Trump is inviting these people

1466
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:54,463
In order to create Ministry of propaganda

1467
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,815
So that's why these people are coming

1468
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,607
In the middle of that

1469
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,935
This is also a test of loyalty

1470
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:10,335
Slugworth will show up globalist

1471
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:15,455
And I suppose if you make the wrong meme that's like fizzy lift

1472
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:23,647
A bunch of little mini Stephen Miller's will show up in a song that would be

1473
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:30,047
Somehow more racist than the already

1474
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Depiction

1475
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
Cannot handle

1476
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,495
The present day we live in the dumbest timeline

1477
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
Yeah

1478
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,359
You ever try and wrap your head around it I dice I've stopped

1479
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,943
I've just decided I can't wrap my head around the world

1480
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:50,527
With that we live in when the going

1481
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,087
Turn pro

1482
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,391
Hunter S Thompson

1483
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,231
Like you just kind of got to lean into it I guess

1484
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,071
Semblance of Sanity while also like

1485
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,863
I mean where are we

1486
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,143
How how

1487
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
How far away from home

1488
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:08,959
Are we

1489
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,007
Without even realizing

1490
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,543
The steps we took away

1491
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199
Like it's crazy every time I walk outside I hear that

1492
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,479
F******

1493
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,879
Everyday everyday I walk outside

1494
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,767
Clownworld Daniel

1495
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:39,679
We are suggesting we talked about it on the ship

1496
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:46,335
S*** now it's not everything is it isn't anti-semitic mean

1497
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:52,479
I mean that's what you know fascist authoritarians do General Hitler co-opted

1498
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,015
VRBO

1499
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,343
It's part of

1500
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
How do you fix

1501
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Infect

1502
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Areas of life

1503
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,743
I can walk them towards their side the okay sign

1504
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
Another

1505
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Example of

1506
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,351
The strategy of

1507
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,679
Mild psychological warfare

1508
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:17,567
So I mean we come to the end of this and I mean I think

1509
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,615
I wouldn't I would assume that people list

1510
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,407
Probably felt this but

1511
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,967
Completely run out of

1512
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,759
I run out of Interest

1513
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,111
Not Alex but like this

1514
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,135
Like

1515
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
But this present

1516
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:38,559
Is much more like the present then maybe how much fun it was to

1517
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,583
Look into Leo's

1518
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:45,471
This is indicative of the experience this like you going

1519
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,591
You kind of expect it's going to be awful

1520
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,151
Do you know because with Epstein getting arrested

1521
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,223
You kind of think that there's going to be an awful nice to it

1522
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,759
He kind of think you know what

1523
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,551
The version of awfulness

1524
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
It's going to be is

1525
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
I need you

1526
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
You stood up

1527
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
You prepare

1528
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Alright

1529
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,719
I'm not I don't want to do this

1530
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
But here we go

1531
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
And what you find it

1532
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
That is largely

1533
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
Alex just read

1534
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,887
Shredding territory that we've covered a hundred times

1535
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
On the show

1536
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,447
You're covered the blood libel

1537
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,471
.

1538
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
His dumbass

1539
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,543
Nonsense

1540
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,079
Tommy Robinson and his history

1541
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
Not

1542
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,199
There isn't there isn't a whole lot that

1543
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,247
It's like climbing a rock

1544
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,527
You just find like

1545
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,319
There's nothing to grab here

1546
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,855
Oh well

1547
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,391
Yeah we we got to the top

1548
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
The mountain

1549
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
So we just go back down

1550
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,815
Is there something up

1551
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
Was there

1552
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,935
Just just the satisfaction of having done

1553
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,703
Boo

1554
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:55,103
Ultimately

1555
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,711
Not all you were me

1556
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,575
Although this does seem to be something of a pattern for him is when there is something where you're like

1557
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,367
You got to have

1558
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,415
He's got to have some awful take

1559
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
A little bit

1560
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,327
I'm barely going to talk about this

1561
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:19,423
This is awful I think I actually everybody already knows what I'm going to say about the

1562
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:31,711
Nail-it lockherup let's call it a day ago about aplenty in the past

1563
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
Break

1564
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,183
Ryan's

1565
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,999
As a jump-off point for something else

1566
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,279
Which is

1567
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,815
Demonizing your opponent

1568
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,631
Justifying the radicalization again

1569
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Them

1570
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,471
And then parlaying that somehow into

1571
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,311
We got to save Tommy Robinson for from

1572
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,615
Consequences of his own actions

1573
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,431
Like I think that if you look at it it really

1574
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,991
It feels like Alex's

1575
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,039
More interested in using

1576
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
Whatever

1577
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
Current events

1578
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,695
Type coverage he has in order to

1579
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,487
Yeah I think he is more interested

1580
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,767
Funneling that towards Tommy

1581
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,839
Tommy is more interested that then

1582
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
DJ dubs

1583
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
Technically is leaving

1584
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,103
Maybe or has already left

1585
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Who knows

1586
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,919
But when he does go

1587
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,735
Alex is looking for a Tommy Rob's

1588
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,503
To take over

1589
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:43,903
No cuz he's already got damn really he already has that off

1590
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
I don't think Alex

1591
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,255
Could afford time

1592
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:53,119
I don't know how desperate Tommy Robinson is but it means you had

1593
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,423
He works for a rebel media

1594
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
He probably would

1595
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
Need more than Alex

1596
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:01,823
If Tommy doesn't

1597
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
Leave the UK

1598
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,895
He's going to get arrested again

1599
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,199
I don't think that's an Alex's best intro

1600
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
To have him

1601
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
Tell me what time

1602
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
Definitely be asking

1603
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Sing for help

1604
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
Do the states

1605
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
Right that's the whole idea

1606
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:20,767
Oh you don't mean someone in England to someone who is British

1607
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,631
I think you could find someone else because I will tell you this right now I guarantee

1608
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:31,519
He is like I am losing a British person who talks like that I need to replace it with another

1609
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
I mean

1610
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
Shirt

1611
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
I guarantee I think

1612
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,895
Think that there are less baggage

1613
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Having people

1614
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
Who having a

1615
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,711
But Alex good

1616
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:43,039
Lock to that rule

1617
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,831
Sure

1618
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:49,439
What what it what is that would be

1619
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,463
Appears

1620
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,279
I know

1621
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,071
Broken record

1622
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
I just don't care

1623
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,191
I care about the Mist

1624
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
Information in misrepresentation

1625
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,287
Stop I absolutely do I care about the

1626
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
Corrosive influence

1627
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:09,407
But this is very interesting Alex's phoning it in

1628
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
Quite a bit

1629
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
Yep

1630
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:13,759
Hello

1631
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:18,111
It's I resent it a little ways to my time

1632
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,695
Much better use of my time then

1633
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,767
The last couple days of his shower

1634
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
So

1635
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,095
Oh man

1636
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,143
Until next time

1637
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,495
It is what it is

1638
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:41,151
Another episode

1639
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:47,551
Right so we also go to bed Jordan

1640
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,135
We are and if you wanted to download our podcast

1641
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
A switch you should do

1642
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,463
You can probably tell some

1643
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
But you can go to

1644
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
Yeah

1645
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,583
Go to a direct libsyn

1646
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,143
You can

1647
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,703
Corner Bodega

1648
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
That will

1649
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,775
Charge you a $5

1650
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,103
To get it but they will give it to you under the table I promise

1651
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
That

1652
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,151
So you can do that there

1653
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
Naturehike

1654
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
Those are fun

1655
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,319
So

1656
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,623
AOC

1657
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,511
Probably has

1658
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
Is Alex Jones

1659
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,983
Alexandra Thurston color
