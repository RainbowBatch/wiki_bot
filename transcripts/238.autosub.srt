00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240

00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,032
Looks like citrus

00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,056
Beverages

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,128

00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,992

00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
So I've been playing is

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Marriott

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,288
The card is a good early in early game military units

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,152
Because it allowed me

14
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Games

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,200
Conquer France

16
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
Real early

17

Took over Paris

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
Owns that

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,000
Eliminate people from the early game

20
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
It is a great

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
Structure of

22
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
It is a great game

23
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
To play while taking notes

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,032
Need a little something to get that little

25
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,848
Yeah anytime listening to Alex

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
You guys write down the time you don't have to you don't have to

27
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,624
To do anything

28
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
Pointing out that it exists

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
Getting me down this damn rabbit hole

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,752
What's my civilization I do a lot of different ways

31
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Is Rome

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104

00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
I like to play I love building

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
I like I'm just all the time cuz you can accelerate the Wonder construction using workers

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,496
61

37
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
It's kind of a coming back into the waters

38
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,408
But I like the shout-out to admire thanks

39
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Everybody should enjoy it

40
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,904
Netflix final table

41
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
Oh man so good

42
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
The most overproduced cooking show I've ever seen

43
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,288
10 million dollars

44
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,624
Picture of the show I think it's so awesome to friendships

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
Avicii like celebration

46
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Cultures

47
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
Very clearly celebrities in other countries

48
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,936
It's so great I think that there's such a multicultural

49
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,288
Like

50
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Ingredients in culturelle

51
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
Cultural very well

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
On the show

53
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
To the point like

54
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
They went to some countries

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
Chose the national

56
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
On the first episode with it to Mexico and they choose tacos

57
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
Continuous

58
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
Great job

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,264
My favorite is whenever they get past the first round of nonsense which is

60
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
But then they have the the

61
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,456
Celebrity celebrity chefs like Amelia

62
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
A'gaci

63
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:17,791
Bothering people today

64
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
Do you think that's

65
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Charles and Rodrigo

66
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983

All the time

78
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,111
Everything is so uplifting

79
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,487
Globalism more transparent

80
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,119
We have a job to do and that's to get as many people as possible to realize that our differences make us

81
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Together

82
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
Shoutout on Facebook

83
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799

So much

85
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
So much Auntie globalist propaganda

86
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,039
And it was a black within the first 20 minutes

87
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,135
This is God

88
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
This is not subtle

89
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
Propaganda it's a reflection

90
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,815
It's a celebration

91
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
It is not something out at all

92
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
But neither is Alex

93
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,567
That's a pretty good transition

94
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,895
Wacky Wednesday

Interesting wacky

116
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,751
To do that one of the things we would like to do is open up

117
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
The fold

118
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
Have a place where there's more ability to respond to audience

119
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
So long lines probably Wednesday

120
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
The place where

121
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
We fulfill

122
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Probably come up

123
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,535
But we also got a number of time travel

124
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Wednesday Style

125
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
Policy wonk

126
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,847
Probably a raptor princess I can't remember I should have made a spreadsheet

127
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
You should have made a spreadsheet ranking art

128
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,855

129
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415

It's actually about

132
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
This guy named

133
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Coach Dave daubenmire

134
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Coach Dave

135
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Use assets

136
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Terrifying

137
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
Sky has a backstory that we're going to get this episode

138
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Varsity he invented

139
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
That would be very Ramsey Show

140
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Rightwingwatch article about him

141
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
Something about that how

142
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,823
His daughters are going to be

143
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
And that to me seems like Bush League bigger

144
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Global

145
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
Legend entice me into

146
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
Whether or not all lesbians the research

147
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
Would be almost 8

148
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
But I was like

149
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Look

150
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
He has been a supporter of the show

151
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
Yet we really appreciate

152
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Him a great deal more to urologist.

153
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Absolutely

154
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
So I looked into

155
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
I watched a couple of videos

156
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,207

Talk about about videos that coached

159
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
The world

160
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Explore him a little bit

161
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495

Might join the fold might enter the arena

166
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Of the Immortals

167
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
The Wacky Wednesday.....

168
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Producer

169
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
My favorite Chef was a chef

170
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Final table is like

171
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
If you win you get to sit down at the

172
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
Connex

173
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,895
That's not how

174
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
You get a seat at the final table

175
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
I do watch the entire show nothing else happens

176
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
It's not like all of them

177
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Cook together

178
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
It's not like

179
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,023
Best episode

180
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,607
Or

181
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
It's not like the winner is not on the level

182
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
It's not like

183
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
It's implied that he is now a judge on the next season along with these other night

184
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Could be

185
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:38,367
Understand what the guiding metaphor of the final table was what it mean

186
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,767
I understand if your honors

187
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
Greenroom of all these other chefs Hangout

00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
What's too much energy today

189
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm so here we coached Dave

190
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
But

191
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
He runs a show called pass the salt

192
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
I don't know why that's the name of the show

193
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
I tried to figure it out

194
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
No idea

195
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Weather.

196
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,047
Nebulous

197
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Decided

198
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
And call it assault

199
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Alright you got all the pieces you need

200
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Does

201
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
Coach

202
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
Relate in any way does he have some part of his backstory

203
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
Passing result is like an anecdote

204
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
Details

205
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
I don't know

206
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
I have no idea I don't think that's like a football term

207
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
Alright

208
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
No idea

209
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
73

210
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823
Sweep to the right side

211
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,919
If it is

212
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Kind of saying it over

213
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
That's what's up

214
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,607
Jellyfish

215
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
80 time

216
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
I forget to give us a new name I believe we are

217
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Jellyfish

218
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,671
And seemingly outrageous comments expressed in this program are based on the Holy Spirit leading

219
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
A man called

220
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Coach asked you this out there

221
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Christian America

222
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
Soul

223
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
With a coach

224
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
Meijer

225
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,823
That's a nice boring wow that's a little excessive

226
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,175
Very Wild coach

227
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,759
Presents himself the interruption but for Jesus

228
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
He's very

229
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Very Christian

230
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Selfie

231
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Being on the radio

232
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,951
He might be in some small Market or something like that

233
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,791
Find FedEx location

234
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
No videos of YouTube channel

235
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Most videos have under 1000

236
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,543
One of the things that I was wrestling with Ian brought this to my attention is like

237
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Is this punching down

238
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Because we have more listeners than

239
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Well I don't know

240
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
With

241
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
Like radio I don't know

242
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
Very low engagement

243
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
It seems

244
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,839
Like just a man spitting out a green screen that has a

245
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Soccer stadium

246
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,471
Superimposed behind him with about 10 people on Skype

247
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
Here's the problem

248
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
Everybody who

249
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
Is sodium deprived that they've given him all their self

250
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
It could be also fun little Soccer Club

251
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,023
Just do him because he was using Thursday

252
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
So

253
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Yeah he he

254
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
His show is bizarre

255
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
About like the possibility of like this is just a

256
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Inconsequential

257
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Guy rambling

258
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
To listen to him or I started

259
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
We're very

260
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
To bring

261
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
And then at the same time

262
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
Some commonalities with Alex

263
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
He

264
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
Talks about how we need to be worried

265
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Because Alex Jones

266
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Is being censored

267
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Stuff like that

268
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
He clearly listens

269
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
To Alex's

270
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
And a lot of his narrative

271
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Follow similar pattern

272
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
We're going to be

273
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Probably faceless

274
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,199
Very very difficult decision that I think most of them are going to

275
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
Revolve around finances

276
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,623
What's going to happen with money what's money going to become we know about fifth coin and

277
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Litecoin and

278
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,743
Gold and silver and everything is certainly a financial

279
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
I don't see the term collapse although that's probably a good time

280
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Is a financial Reckoning

281
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Depot in that all of us.

282
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Soap

283
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,615
Financial

284
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
He talks about that a good thing

285
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Alex ever does which is just

286
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
We're all in.

287
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,695
Wow like that

288
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Conspiracies about the Federal Reserve

289
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
That would be the way he

290
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
He described it

291
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
We're all in.

292
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,935
Rap

293
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
Right

294
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Assertive

295
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
Use evolve his rhetoric

296
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
Because

297
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
The vager

298
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Because

299
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Absolutely

300
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Situation

301
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
They have diminished buying power bi

302
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
It makes him seem a little more reasonable that he doesn't go

303
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
As far as I

304
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,719
Financial advice

305
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
To hear us talk about someone who's

306
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
And you were asking

307
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
If he is a cup

308
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
You want to get to the bottom

309
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
Yeah I need this I need this Nelson mystery solved the real quick

310
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
Have to wait too long to get to the bottom of

311
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
Next clip

312
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Coach

313
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Expresses something

314
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
I think

315
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
Ziguidi to send missionaries

316
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Alright

317
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
To understanding

318
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
His past

319
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Fun4all

320
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
I'm going to really make him mad

321
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
I do the most

322
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
Are you

323
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Enjoy

324
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
York people from your church

325
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
On a mission trip

326
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
You won't even try to evangelize your own Publix

327
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
Cuz there's laws

328
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Can I tell you

329
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
I'll go in there baby safe

330
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Columbus City School

331
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
East High School

332
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
They don't need the gospel there I guess

333
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:20,447
So you are concerned about who that was chiming in like I said he has a bunch of people on Skype and most of them just

334
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
U2 every now and again he'll amen

335
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
Monitors on Skype on his show he probably has like six or seven people

336
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,623
Who will chiman occasionally with

337
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
Or

338
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,719
They have little mini

339
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
They're like picture-in-picture

340
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
Alright five of them

341
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
The real hang out like a group chat

342
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
Deeply f***** up I kind of see this a little bit like Hollywood Squares whenever they zumar off when they zoom in

343
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,183
People who are the celebrities who are healthy

344
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
Hollywood Squares but only the three on the

345
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
That's exactly where you're at it's a mess

346
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
So

347
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
He's talking about how you needed to send missionary

348
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,079
Yeah you illegally nicely to get it out

349
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
Against the law

350
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,199
Here we go. The Coach Dave daubenmire is Nautica

351
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Coach

352
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,087
That's because in 1999 he was sued by the ACLU

353
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,927
Because for years you've been fortunate students before and after game

354
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,767
Evangelize

355
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Back in 99

356
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,983
Naturally this life to some parents and community members filing complaints

357
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
ACLU took up their call

358
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,663
Today coach claims he won money in lawsuit after the ACLU settled out of court

359
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,503
In reality the ACLU worked out a settlement and withdrew the case

360
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,575
After the school and Coach agreed to put a stop to the practices

361
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
Who's that were found

362
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
Unnecessary

363
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
And the only reason to proceed at that point would be punished

364
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
School District

365
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
The ACLU had no in

366
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
The agreement set up a mechanism where the school is required to relay

367
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Complaint involving coach

368
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
To the ACLU directly

369
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:37,408
World ticket. So this is this is a coach

370
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Small school

371
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,784
I don't know if it was individual Public School

372
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,392
Yeah vet now has to report directly to the ACLU

373
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
If the principal gets a complaint from somebody

374
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,400
Superintendent clu

375
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
Control it going on for years

376
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
But there might be

377
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
A situation a place where they're covering it up

378
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Spoiler alert

379
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
He's a pretty good coach

380
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,112
You have all these stories of his Angels in the Outfield

381
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:22,208
Abuses that would happen in Texas schools

382
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Yeah yeah

383
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
You have a situation

384
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Here where this guy is acting

385
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Brightness settings

386
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
Inappropriate

387
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:40,896
I'm uncomfortable with that but I am going to allow it to the ACLU setup this thing where they had

388
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,968
Had to do that in order to make sure that he was fulfilling

389
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
The agreement

390
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,624
Didn't is a spell.

391
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,280
So like a hundred million dollars we just want you to stay with kids

392
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
So as a part of the deal Coach Dave

393
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
Any further complaint

394
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
You got another contract

395
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Undoubtedly have been renewed

396
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
No

397
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,432
After your board is not religiously abusing children

398
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
Religiously abused children

399
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Leave this principle

400
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
And is actually not a very good coach if he's a quitter

401
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
That's not a good coach we'll see what happens

402
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
Across the London School District

403
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
$2,000 in attorney's

404
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
And coaches. Telling a story

405
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
He wanted

406
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
After this coaches

407
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Pretty much unhireable by public

408
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
What schools are religious

409
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,808
He founded his ministry pass the salt

410
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
What military group

411
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
Mostly just into complaining

412
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:01,024
From their website

413
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
Regional grocery store to remove

414
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,632
Entry-level poured magazines from their shelves

415
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
Ed quote eating a local Columbus Community announcing a homosexual bathhouse from their community

416
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Corn maggot

417
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,712
Is like muscle mass or like lowrider

418
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Revelations I guess

419
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
You got rid of a spa and now the grocery store can has bodybuilding magazines

420
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816
So minute to notice entry-level torn bags from grocery store

421
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,144
These groups not only wasted everyone's time but they're clear public

422
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Expressions

423
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
They also were involved

424
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
The removal of the

425
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Commandments from Adam

426
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
County Ohio

427
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Travel to munch

428
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,688
Gomery Alabama to Judge Roy Moore

429
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
Always gets worse

430
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
Always

431
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:04,512
It doesn't turn into a disaster

432
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,840
Sunset District 5 hammers, be real bad

433
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
As he's creating pass the salt Ministry

434
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:20,640
Create

435
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
It's weird along the way as he's

436
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
Creating youth ministry

437
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
He also been coaching football at the Fairfield Christian

438
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Academy in Ohio

439
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
He also got fired from that job in 2012

440
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,496
Didn't have anything to do with too much praise it's the Christian Academy

441
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
You just can't help but

442
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Because mine

443
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,920
Diorite

444
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
So I

445
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,344
In 2014 he tried to return to coaching secular High School football unfortunately public outcry led to

446
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
I8

447
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
It's like change.org petition

448
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
Also the school board of Lakewood High School voted against him being allowed

449
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,800
Auto job Anthony has not been allowed to come back to public school football coaching

450
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
My hometown

451
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
F****** tomorrow

452
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:29,760
There are so many places where you can go where people would not only welcome the fact that you were censored by the f****** ursin

453
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
Assured by the ACLU

454
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Crazy

455
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
Yeah I mean it is a sort of Feathering

456
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
He was able to

457
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,608
In the first place right Reverend of

458
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,936
The ACLU came after me I was off

459
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
That makes some sort of more relevant

460
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
These right-wing

461
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Extreme

462
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
World

463
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
So it's a little bit about

464
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,040
Ways to use pass the salt that might make sense later on

465
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
You're going to give it to me

466
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:14,560
And say that we're not allowed to learn

467
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,120
We are the salt of the earth

468
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
That could be right

469
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Why would you want to pass people

470
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,032
Historically salt

471
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
Was like

472
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
Luxury item

473
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
It was used

474
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Maybe that's what it's really all about

475
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
The good guys

476
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
All over

477
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Like I said

478
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
I noticed some Alex Jones

479
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Adjacent narratives

480
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
Weather others that I didn't

481
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Incase

482
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824

Holding a lot to the vest

486
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
But not pasta

487
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
But I will reveal some

488
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
One of them

489
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Another, now

490
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
With our show

491
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
And that is

492
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
A guest

493
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
That

494
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
Sit down with that we have talked

495
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
Hi Frances is Coach Dave daubenmeyer at news with use. TV at news with him. Common I got a taste

496
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:43,136
TV channel guide on JB Williams

Underground

500
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
Underground

501
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:04,128
As far as mainstream media doesn't want anything to do with this guy and I believe the Doctor James David Manning

502
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,200
Is probably the most dangerous man

503
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,784
All of America to the Obama Administration

504
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
To our mutual friend boots

505
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
Their hearts Are knitted together he has a f****** episode where he sits down

506
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:33,824
The guy who are two weeks ago

507
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
Armies to rise up in

508
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,664
Imagine

509
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
I I can't imagine what they bonded over

510
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
I can't imagine either

511
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,648
Must be just a random thing and he just has Manning

512
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
Anything about it

513
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
He legit says in this interview with him

514
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
I listen to you everyday

515
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
I'm a huge fan of your show

516
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:01,728
So you have no reason to not be aware of murdering gay people

517
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
Yeah because I don't know

518
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Wait till

519
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,600
Reverend Manning and Coach date mutual friend named

520
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,184
They're both religious zealot

521
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,608
People and black people

522
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:33,984

523
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264

00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
Bicycle Connection is so strong

533
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,840
It doesn't appear maybe initially that they would

534
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,144
Be super inline

535
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
But like I said

536
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,752
Their homophobes people are weird

537
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:13,152
Versace

538
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320

These guys

545
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
Dick

546
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:34,400
We can't allow it

547
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:42,336
These homosexual

548
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,760
Swelling music behind it this is this is ESPN show

00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
F******

552
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
I was watching

553
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Canada

554
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Homosexual

555
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
In the preacher

556
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
All that

557
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,632
Marco's amen no

558
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Miles

559
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,544
He smiles immediately after you said homosexual

560
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,664
Yeah we're getting this homework

561
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
Robbing the people blind

562
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:30,976
And and having people watching children fall apart

563
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Fall Apart

564
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,544
Long Legged Mack Daddy

565
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
Is true

566
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,152
You don't know about Long Legged Mack Daddy

567
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Catchphrases

568
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
He rose to prominence

569
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,464
Cost of a long ladybug

570
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,536
You came to us because of characterizing Barack Obama is

571
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
But that's

572
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,936
Good turn of phrase

573
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
Otherwise catchphrases

574
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Can phrase

575
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
I don't know that's not sick

576
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
Positive

577
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:32,160
Show me

578
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,304
Certificate

579
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
But appears to be

580
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Fun

581
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
Excuse

582
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
2

583
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Talk s*** about

584
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
To be filled with hate

585
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,360
Well cover

586
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Really again

587
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
And I'm sure he's going to do it in a very respectful way

588
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,624
There's

589
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,672
I don't know if it'll play on the sound

590
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
End of the episode

591
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
Saw the

592
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Interesting

593
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,608
Looking at the wave file as I do that

594
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
He's different

595
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
What he says black

596
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,104
There's something vocal quality

597
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
I think it's

598
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Perceptible from list

599
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
But if you

600
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,992
Put this episode into audacity

601
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
You'll f****** see a difference

602
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
In the way you speak

603
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Knowledge

604
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,864
2087

605
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,264
Because you are worrying are so you need Doctor Manny because not only are you a man of God

606
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,080
But you are a black man of God

607
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,944
But even more unusual is you were a black man of God

608
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
Warren

609
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:07,136
About what you called this Long Legged Mack Daddy Barack Hussein Obama

610
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
5 years ago

611
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,328
And you were speaking at that time really talked him into the black community and watch some of the

612
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,936
Videos of something that you said to black people

613
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
It's not a black or white

614
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
Only two races those Racing for heaven and those Racing for help and he was a black

615
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,696
Speaking the truth

616
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,280
Long before anybody else really saw

617
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
It was Jesus

618
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:56,032
There's a different vocal

619
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:02,432
Yeah I didn't realize that you could say Blacklist away that you saved you with a heart

620
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
That is uncomfortable to say at what time let alone everytime you say

621
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
Listen to feel like

622
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,024
I saw it in the van that was when I was like

623
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
There is something

624
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Wheatley

625
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:24,448
F****** weird and different

626
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,496
Walnuts absolutely

627
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,056
Is going out to Jews

628
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,152
Joann

629
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,992
Jews like

630
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
I think that's how

631
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,600
That's f***** up you even say it like that

632
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,488
Also spoiler alert is an episode I listen to that we're not going to be going over

633
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Visa

634
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
It is

635
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
So f***** up

636
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,168
It is just

637
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Forgot to put it on

638
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,360
Could not go now you could just say no

639
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
On Skype I don't want to do this

640
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:21,792
I guess that's definitional that your world

641
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,096
Our talking about how Jews are the devil

642
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
And how they're up like their father and I

643
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
He keeps asking

644
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Advance Auto

645
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:37,408
I like this show is why

646
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:41,504
The Jeb Bush please clap but if if you're Gods like that that's nice

647
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
Alright

648
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Jesus

649
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
So

650
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
Vocalization

651
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
The verbal pattern

652
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Results

653
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
I got bread

654
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
Whiteflies

655
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
More life

656
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
I think that was based on

657
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
Here is coach

658
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,288
I don't think any single person listening

659
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
To this point

660
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Is like

661
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:11,200
It's probably nothing we haven't really seen

662
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
Racism

663
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,784
Walmart

664
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Northlake Auto

665
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,952
Seems like there's a black like like that

666
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:26,048
He totally fair and say like

667
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Is real bad

668
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,240
Dr. Manning I forgot to message beginning your

669
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,032
Your church in Harlem

670
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:59,328
It begins to speak to black people black

671
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,168
In the truth is Doctor Manning I wrote about this I don't know couple

672
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
4 years ago maybe it was I said the

673
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,872
Mini blinds are Christian

674
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
12

675
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
Listen to

676
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
You have a very small audience

677
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,440
Got a lot of attention today

678
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Look this

679
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
Gross

680
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Calling Harlem

681
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Jungle

682
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,120
Number one

683
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,704
Immediately say you're surrounded by black

684
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
Elucidating

685
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,176
I call it a jungle

686
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,064
People which he says

687
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,112
As a problem

688
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,768
He says you are surrounded by your in a jungle as we assumed in Ohio once again proving Ohio

689
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:07,168
Iowa should also be on our list of states with Mississippi and Louisiana

690
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
I know but you never think you're annoying

691
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:18,176
You keep on doing what you doing also annoying

692
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
Vile

693
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
I mean this is just

694
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
I think Kevin May

695
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,208
Coach sort of excuse

696
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
Cover to be erased

697
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Alphabet

698
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
They have a great time

699
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:45,312
Nothing white supremacist love more than a black white supremacist

700
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,200
About how Reverend Manning did that mock trial about Obama

701
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,344
F****** coaches like I heard about that I really wanted to come I wished I could have been there

702
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
I believe I believe

703
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Mailman

704
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
They talked about that a little bit

705
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Really interested

706
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
I lived

707
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
Really close to

708
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
And I went down to the

709
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
The coffee shop

710
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
No one remembered him

711
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,408
I went down that talk to people at

712
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,712
The black bookstore no one remembers him

713
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
What's the turnover

714
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
For that bookstore

715
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
First of all

716
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Second

717
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
You just like

718
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:34,208
Building this argument about like I talked to a bunch of people no one remembers Barack Obama being

719
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
And what do you do

720
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
Do is talk about anything real

721
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Like

722
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,352
A transcript

723
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
From the University

724
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,216
Doesn't he does say that he did get a degree

725
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
From Columbia

726
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
But of course

727
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
That

728
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Is cover

729
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,895
That's the CIA got him in order to

730
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Who knows

731
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
Show me the birth certificate

732
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
See what you get like when you get these people

733
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Believe all of this

734
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:05,183
Can I talk to someone at a coffee shop they didn't remember him and that's proof

735
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
From Columbia

736
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
Do normal people

737
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
To Columbia

738
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
And said he wasn't there cuz it's

739
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
That makes sense

740
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
It's so.

741
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
About is like these

742
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
Dumb f******

743
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,823
Ideas

744
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
Conspiracies already talked about

745
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
Because of

746
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Adjacency

747
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
Manning or out

748
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:32,831
But a new one came up I thought it was really

749
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,623
And here we got a new conspiracy

750
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Dumb

751
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:41,023
Any questions

752
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,839
They call him names

753
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,911
But the fact remains that Barack Obama

754
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:52,287
Michelle Obama

755
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,223
Practicing law

756
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
Twenty-some years in public education

757
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:07,903
I keep my keep my license up-to-date who knows when I might need it

758
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,487
Why would I took a business

759
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,351
The only reason you turn in the license

760
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,887
With the bar

761
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,983
Whatever

762
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
That they found that you did

763
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,527
Same thing same thing from Chef you don't go to Harvard

764
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,183
And allow degree from Harvard and then turn around and passed the bar

765
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:51,167
He realized

766
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:57,567
Back to the law

767
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
Email this is just a chain email

768
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
Conspiracy that went around

769
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
People who are in charge of Eli

770
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,855
Illinois bars

771
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,671
Issue with the law license

772
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Requires education

773
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
You have to go in for classes

774
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:23,167
For the registration Barack Obama decided they didn't want

775
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,751
Anymore as Barack Obama

776
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:33,151
Illinois House aspirations to become a senator and then

777
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,503
He had a path forward that he wanted to go in and it wasn't

778
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
Practice

779
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,343
Whether it was even before that Community organizing

780
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
Things like that

781
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
Require logic

782
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,183
All it does is

783
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
So they decided

784
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
We're not going to maintain them

785
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
Now

786
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
Amber Alert

787
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
Even if you let your logic relapse

788
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
You can take classes and pay

789
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,287
They didn't surrender ship

790
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
Is Obama today

791
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Start practice

792
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
Which by the way would be

793
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Peanut

794
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,991
Almost

795
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,207
He's going to buy us before

796
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
I think that would be a little bit

797
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,815
But if you want to practice law outside of a courtroom

798
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Maybe give legal advice in

799
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
Official capacity

800
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,519
Could you just have to pay a fee

801
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
And go in for like a

802
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Update

803
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,615
Or whatever

804
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
Because they follow the proper channels

805
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
In order to enact

806
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Activator login

807
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,759
Actually I'll be honest

808
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
Barack Obama probably

809
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
Because his status is

810
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
Retired

811
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
He retired

812
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
There's an active and retired

813
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
Is just an act

814
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
Barack Obama

815
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
Retired so he may not be able to

816
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Pedophilia

817
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
His dad

818
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,703
His standing

819
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:07,871
Imagine if Michelle Obama just suddenly did was like Defender now

820
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
We already discussed

821
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
It would buy us courts

822
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
I think it might be more problematic

823
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
Worth although it would be really

824
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Cool that she took off on

825
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,535
Only like big corporate clients or something like that

826
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,327
I see a hero story out of

827
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Finer.

828
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:33,471
Corporations.

829
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
She takes on

830
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Wells Fargo as a client

831
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,871
Takes them all

832
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,295
Defenders

833
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
We have here

834
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
Mysterious name of pasta sauce

835
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
We have a history of

836
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
Force religion on your kids

837
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
Right

838
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,167
Was he ever an educator

839
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
Yeah so

840
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
We get back

841
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
To the death

842
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
Yeah we got a new episode

843
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Of his show

844
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,575
Name of this episode

845
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Cuz this guy

846
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Please just

847
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
Super religious weirdo

848
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
Horrible conservative

849
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Yeah

850
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
Cumbersome

851
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,959
Call my wacky way

852
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,127
Real quickly

853
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
We're going to do a whole show on it

854
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,807
With this whole thing about the Mandela effect

855
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,391
Being in the Bible

856
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,815
Lion and the lamb

857
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,055
Isaiah

858
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
Isaiah 11

859
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
Ezekiel

860
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
Or Corinthians

861
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,575
Could have been

862
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,279
As we left yesterday

863
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,935
Let me tell you what's going on

864
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,007
Universes

865
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
Rice University

866
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,359
Berenstain Bears The Berenstain Bears

867
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,199
Artificial intelligence

868
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,015
Sinbad was the superhero

869
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
The world in which we live to a

870
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
The Demonic Realm

871
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,447
These people are going to call a parallel universes

872
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,799
I will call it parallel Realm

873
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
What is CERN

874
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Decided to do

875
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
20 minutes

876
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
Just him talking about

877
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
The cookout

878
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
Plugs

879
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
The beginning

880
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,511
The rest of the show is all about

881
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
And he believes it's real

882
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
And he believes one of the biggest

883
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
But

884
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,151
Is that everyone knows

885
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
Image

886
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
The Christian Utopia

887
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
Is a lion laying down with the lamb

888
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,135
I will explain

889
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
Exactly

890
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
Remember this

891
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
In a minute

892
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
And he

893
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
Robert

894
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Nope will get you

895
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
But he accidentally

896
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,607
Says why

897
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
A little bit later

898
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,191
But he's going to make a huge deal out of this

899
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,215
The Bible

900
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,823
3 minutes

901
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,175
History of talking about the lion laying down with the lamb

902
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:39,487
Please play the long clip of people saying the lion lays down with the lamb

903
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:44,863
Wherever you are right now

904
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:51,263
Isaiah 11:6 and you'll see the wolf also shall dwell

905
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,543
With the lamb

906
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,527
The wolf shall dwell with the lamb

907
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:08,415
Real quick he just had the lion and the fatling

908
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
Skype

909
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,703
The Lion and the lamb and Isaiah 6

910
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
And the Wardrobe

911
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
No longer

912
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,111
So here's my problem with this Theory

913
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
Yeah but

914
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,583
None of the other pop culture that involves this hat

915
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
The owner saying

916
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,935
Like poems that have been written involve The Lion and the lamb

917
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Now that's

918
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
Just specifically one thing that

919
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,407
Please change this is my problem with tons of you

920
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
The Mandela effect

921
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,479
Is that like they seem like

922
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,527
Okay you have to assume

923
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
Malevolent

924
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
Intelligent

925
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
Behind

926
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,207
Otherwise everything else would have changed along with it

927
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Right

928
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
But

929
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
It's not

930
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:23,423
It's chaotic evil on our Dungeons & Dragons

931
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
Franklin

932
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:30,591
You only change the one passage in the Bible that

933
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:36,479
Ostensibly everybody is referencing in order to make everybody look what coach likes to make the argument

934
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
This is why there's a

935
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,271
Another verse

936
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
The word of God on

937
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,671
Right because that's not going to change.

938
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:48,511
So he makes the argument that God was saying write the word of God on your heart soul

939
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:55,167
Demon time travel and go back you will know the correct word of God

940
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,567
Bordering on time traveling Nazis trying to change the future

941
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,919
Lion

942
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Superficial

943
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
0 meaning

944
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,319
The idea is a predatory animal lays down with prey

945
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,111
That's it that's all

946
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,695
You can have the exact same meaning behind a wolf in a

947
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:22,047
It doesn't matter is why it has to be chaotic

948
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
Sabri just f****** with it

949
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,375
No it's not

950
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,703
It's it's time trolling

951
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:35,103
It's

952
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,455
Just trying to trigger coat

953
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,087
Worthwhile task

954
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,463
Just concerned with O and

955
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
In the next life you sound like

956
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:57,375
Don't freshman in a dorm

957
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,703
Shaquille O'Neal

958
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
Funny dad wait

959
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
Who's Kazam

960
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
Shazam

961
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
Show me a video here in your mind

962
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
Holy God

963
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:22,975
Uncle pennybags

964
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Or not

965
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,895
Yeah baby

966
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,551
I remember how you spell Berenstain Bear

967
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,367
Depended on what part of the country you are in

968
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
I never

969
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
Reddit

970
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,583
Habitat

971
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,447
Spell

972
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,639
Remember

973
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
Remember he's fallible

974
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,271
Chili's

975
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,647
What was the first phrase you remember

976
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,207
It was made of deer like a box

977
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,023
Chocolates you never know what you're going to get

978
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:30,815
DD

979
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
The Mandela effect

980
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:36,191
It is about this is the actual life was like a box of chocolate

981
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
But everyone remembers

982
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
He's like a boss

983
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Because

984
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
Forrest Gump

985
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
Carefully

986
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,783
Just answered

987
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,855
Said life was like a box of chocolates

988
00:55:54,367 --> 00:56:00,511
He said it correct cuz he's part of the Mandela effect the way that the

989
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,791
Quote actually

990
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:07,935
Now let's hear what coach says immediately after that

991
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,983
I never saw it

992
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,895
Life is like a box of chocolates or life was like a box of chocolate

993
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:24,831
When Forrest Gump sitting there

994
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:45,055
Briefly what's the Mandela effect

995
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
So the guy who answered it

996
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,407
It said life was like a box of chocolate

997
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,759
Is or was

998
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
He started the question himself and it is

999
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:03,487
So the other thing after that he plays with long clip of people like a video that some of the YouTube clip

1000
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,279
Explain the Mandela effect

1001
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
Idea that this

1002
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,399
Just one person thought that

1003
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
Nelson Mandela

1004
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
He died in prison

1005
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:17,311
The actual death of Nelson Mandela

1006
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,895
Post about it found a bunch of other people thought the same thing to them

1007
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,711
Started so he plays the part of the video that

1008
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Explain

1009
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
Like this all this

1010
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Non-Stop

1011
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
But immediately stops

1012
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:35,743
At the exact point when a memory researcher is about to explain

1013
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
Yeah

1014
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,071
There are suggestibility

1015
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,199
It's almost a pack animal kind of situation where it's better to agree with somebody than it is to

1016
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,735
They're totally wrong

1017
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
It is.

1018
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,855
Hungry

1019
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,671
But we are going to

1020
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,959
Where are we

1021
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,567
With technology.

1022
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,359
Think about before there were phone

1023
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,943
They have no conception

1024
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,503
Send voice down a wire

1025
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,807
Invoice would appear somewhere else

1026
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,391
Ever ever in a million years

1027
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
Nope

1028
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:40,511
Well in about seven thousand years they would believe it

1029
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
Call Bethany

1030
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,703
The machines that are creating the interruption of our

1031
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,031
What's a very strong arm

1032
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:58,431
For climate change

1033
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
Technology

1034
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
Yep

1035
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,015
Nope

1036
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
Our universe

1037
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:09,951
Now the problem is our technology is broken timeline on our planet

1038
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,215
Time machine

1039
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,543
Future

1040
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,015
Batman

1041
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:51,679
People on television 310

1042
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
I believe

1043
00:59:55,263 --> 01:00:00,127
Allconnect

1044
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,967
Pieology

1045
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,855
Literally just said what I think is going on

1046
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,671
Is otherworldly tectonic technology

1047
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,487
Yes I do

1048
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:20,863
Turn around forever

1049
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,471
Let's earn congratulations Rogers new grandson yesterday

1050
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,895
He said the lion

1051
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Where did that come from

1052
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
That is wrong

1053
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:50,047
Yes he's down with the lamb comes from the Elvis Presley song peace in the valley came out in 1957

1054
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,839
The other Institution

1055
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
The other instances

1056
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
People quoting the verse

1057
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:57,983
Are actually people quoted the Elvis song trying to get better rhythm

1058
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Funkier coming off your tongue

1059
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:07,455
There's an alliterative quality to The Lion and the lamb which is why there would bring that to

1060
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
To the table

1061
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,527
The song work with wolf

1062
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,599
And Elvis took a creative license because

1063
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:20,255
The actual meaning is not I don't know

1064
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Examples

1065
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,583
These people giving speeches even Martin Luther King

1066
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,607
These

1067
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
Hit song

1068
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Valley

1069
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,519
Infiltrated people's minds

1070
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,591
Articulation of the lion lays down with

1071
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
Does

1072
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:41,503
Wolf lies down with the lamb

1073
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,783
And no one question.

1074
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,855
That's the bigger story

1075
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,975
50 years realize they were saying the wrong thing

1076
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,399
God damn it doesn't write a catchy phrase

1077
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,471
Even if you don't realize where that sort of

1078
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
I guess meme

1079
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,335
Linguistic

1080
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
Come from

1081
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
Most likely where it comes from

1082
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Creative license

1083
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
The first

1084
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
I was wondering quoting scripture

1085
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
He was writing a song

1086
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,367
I'm so people just

1087
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
Sounds better have you

1088
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
In overtime

1089
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Become the accepted

1090
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,767
Good version of what lies down with the lamb

1091
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,583
Well it's not like anybody and

1092
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
Dude is later catalog

1093
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,799
Weather

1094
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,919
No it's like

1095
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,991
Snow in the way twitch

1096
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
That was written in what Isaiah

1097
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:52,671
Yeah Isaiah 11:6 so that would have been written

1098
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Well

1099
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,743
It would have been written in what

1100
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,535
It would've been written in Greek

1101
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,351
Yeah something like that

1102
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,959
Maybe Aramaic why would why would everybody have ever needed

1103
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:11,359
Question the soundness of the phrase bar

1104
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,575
But the meaning doesn't matter it's

1105
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
Bible can always be improved in English

1106
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
Apples that are like

1107
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
Eva

1108
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
Fundamental

1109
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,679
From what they might have been

1110
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:38,239
Conversation

1111
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:42,335
Conversation about the difference between a lion and a wolf

1112
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,383
Not an interesting conversation

1113
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:53,087
The whole show on it I like to live

1114
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,695
I don't know

1115
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:02,303
I remember it being

1116
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,119
Instead of thinking maybe I got it wrong

1117
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,447
With an explanation based

1118
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,471
How our brains

1119
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
Locate

1120
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,871
If you include like

1121
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,967
Especially modern phenomenon of troll which is the case with that

1122
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Sinbad

1123
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
Being in Shazam

1124
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,831
Rare

1125
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,671
Because there are some

1126
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Even been

1127
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Taking a bath

1128
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
But like what

1129
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
Well there is one that

1130
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,239
Me and Marty DeRosa didn't episode of our podcast

1131
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
That's what they want you to

1132
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
About this young lady

1133
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,847
Who was found dead

1134
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Water Tower

1135
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,919
The building

1136
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,967
Hotel

1137
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,015
In Los Angeles

1138
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,551
Right but when

1139
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,111
I thought that

1140
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,135
Years before

1141
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
Fairly recently

1142
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,535
We get the episode

1143
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,559
Betta in my head

1144
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,911
This happened to Waze back I've known about this

1145
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
I express that on the episode

1146
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
About it

1147
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
They got some message

1148
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,591
I also thought that happen

1149
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,943
It's unclear exactly why we thought that

1150
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
It's a collective Miss

1151
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
Remembering

1152
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
I don't know exactly how to

1153
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
Explain that one

1154
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,111
Snow White

1155
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
The

1156
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,463
Wicked witch doesn't save your mirror on the wall who's the fairest

1157
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,815
Of the mall

1158
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,095
There's a I don't remember exactly

1159
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,983
Magic mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all

1160
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,079
Maybe we could just call maybe we could just recall like let's

1161
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,871
With Rebrand the Mandela effect

1162
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
2

1163
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,271
Let's Collective punch up

1164
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,855
You do like we're all just kind of getting together and being like

1165
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:07,487
Not that great I remember better than that because that has a better ring off

1166
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:12,095
That's what it is collective

1167
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:12,863
Diversion

1168
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
Insecurities

1169
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,191
Just trust your own member

1170
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,239
You know that cuz you right have

1171
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,031
Skewed perspective on every

1172
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,591
It's always come from a subjective

1173
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,919
Overtime

1174
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,783
Lou's Pizza Xavier take more information so it's not like

1175
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951

1176
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,767
What video is people are like

1177
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,583
Bouncing balls back and forth to each other and then

1178
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,887
You watch it the third time and then somebody's like

1179
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:50,495
You realize there was a gorilla but there was a man in a gorilla cross the water through their new life

1180
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:55,615
Well I even know that you're like okay well fine then the brain isn't trustworthy to f*** off

1181
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
If you focus your attention on

1182
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,199
You miss something else

1183
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,735
So far

1184
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,271
Bears like of course

1185
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,295
I thought it was spelled bear

1186
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,367
Normal suffix

1187
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,719
Retinal of course without those books as kids

1188
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
So like

1189
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
To a kid

1190
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
You don't give a s*** who wrote

1191
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
Comes up towards the end of this

1192
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
Mandela effect

1193
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,591
Episode

1194
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
He doesn't turn off his phone

1195
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,175

1196
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,479
Hey guys listen to me

I don't know what's going on with the Mandela

1198
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:40,671
I told you sitting in your church understand

1199
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,719
What's going on in the world

1200
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,583
Call him back

1201
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:54,239
President

1202
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:58,079
Greendale

1203
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,895
I don't say this is fact this is true

1204
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,199
How do you make the fish

1205
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,463
How much information on the Mandela effect

1206
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,023
Never heard from the Mandela effect

1207
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,143
Is it in the Bible

1208
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
Change the

1209
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,127
You've nails

1210
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
I mean alright

1211
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
Great

1212
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,623
Popshit

1213
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
I think

1214
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,231
And I'm putting forth the idea that there's a demon

1215
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
It's Aaron's fault

1216
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,303
Turn all this

1217
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,351
Do you understand

1218
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
The show

1219
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
Not true

1220
01:08:55,167 --> 01:09:01,311
Google

1221
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:06,431
And probably believe those lies because of the lies that I believe

1222
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
Think about stuff

1223
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,479
Like this

1224
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
Way

1225
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,039
But he wouldn't want that seems fan

1226
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,599
Talks about God

1227
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:17,439
Like I'm just saying I don't know if they're true

1228
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,743
Well that's what your show is you talk about

1229
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
Bigoted opinion

1230
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,327
It's about things

1231
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,119
A lot

1232
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
Just not

1233
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,471
Cuz if that's the case

1234
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
That's on you

1235
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,055
That's

1236
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,759
Obviously because demons have changed

1237
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:46,367
His memory audit when God started talking to him about the man jealous if you recall

1238
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
At the beginning of episode

1239
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927

Mandela effect

1244
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
Less Fun

1245
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,967

For Charlottesville

1248
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,463
First of all I'll say is

1249
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,511
Soundly

1250
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,327

And I'm like I don't understand why you

01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,775
You think you know what you're talkin

1255
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
And then the other stuff

1256
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
Dangerously

1257
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Bigoted

1258
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431

01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,135

01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
The scoundrel

1268
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,847
Martin Luther King with a

1269
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,895

1270
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,855

Confederate Heroes

1278
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,943
If they still consider us the Bible Belt

1279
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,015
I'll say that again Ray

1280
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,343
Yeah right

1281
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,879
Felt the Bible Belt

1282
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,183
Stronghold of Christianity in this

1283
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
Nation

1284
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,255

1285
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:15,359

1296
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,639
They don't bring that up at all except for a little bit later one of these people on YouTube

1297
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,711
But it was about slavery was

1298
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,479
Was about

1299
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,063

1344
01:14:55,103 --> 01:15:01,247
Facebook research yesterday

1345
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
National

1346
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,559
Do you say your wife

1347
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,679
America first

1348
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,703
America first

1349
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:29,919
That means you're not allowed to say

1350
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
Our Superior

1351
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:39,391
No

1352
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:46,303
I should be a Christian nationalist

1353
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
The trick you better miss you better not miss

1354
01:15:55,007 --> 01:16:01,151
No stop it

1355
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,623
Fine with that if anyone

1356
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,215
The times people Call wifey

1357
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
People marching

1358
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
Racist

1359
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,847
No it's because they're celebrating

1360
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:37,247
It's not there it's like how the pride parade is also all about how all other gender Orient

1361
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,783
Tatian should be

1362
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,623
Subjugated

1363
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,647
Play Parade

1364
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:48,511
It was all white

1365
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,583
What is it national nut St Patrick's Day

1366
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
Coaches white Nash

1367
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,615
White nationalist just means

1368
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,639
International

1369
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
And that is not at all correct

1370
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
That's what

1371
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Expressing

1372
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,295
He's just

1373
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,831
I believe that our country

1374
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,135
You should come first in the world and I'm white

1375
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
Not recognizing a white National

1376
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,023
White nationalist very specifically

1377
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,815
The country they have nationalist

1378
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
Dominated by there

1379
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,935
In our present situation they believed that the United

1380
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,959
States is a white

1381
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,751
Country Inn must remain a white

1382
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:34,847
Country's immigration multiculturalism

1383
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
Are outright attacks on the

1384
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Canute survival

1385
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,175
The white race

1386
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Well this is

1387
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,735
Pretty clearly a racist

1388
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,039
Position most nationalistic cowards

1389
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,367
And they hide behind the idea that Preserve

1390
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:50,719
Unfortunately racist idea because

1391
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,767
Plies

1392
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,607
Non-white people in a white culture would make the culture that's created

1393
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,399
Superior than it was before

1394
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:03,519
Right I mean I understand you would be arguing about it

1395
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,591
If it makes it better if it makes all the culture better

1396
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:12,991
I think it'd be a fine argument if there were like Fifty white people left and you were like

1397
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,831
Extinguisher

1398
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,975
Super duper Nest protect

1399
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,767
Like those on

1400
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
Visited try exactly

1401
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,863
The argument

1402
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631
Stewby's

1403
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,655
We're protecting culture

1404
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
Nan wife

1405
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
Ruins

1406
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:41,663
The only other approach I can imagine would be to argue the culture is static and unchanging

1407
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,271
And the culture that existed is exactly the same

1408
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,343
Of course this is also a stupid

1409
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
There's no culture

1410
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,975
Defend other than the status quo

1411
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,767
Level of political Financial

1412
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,559
And social control over non-white

1413
01:18:59,327 --> 01:18:59,839
Of course

1414
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,655
Because this is an ideology that is on the one hand

1415
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,935
Based on race

1416
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,007
Desperate appear appear like it's not

1417
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,799
It always inevitably leads to

1418
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:12,383
Superfund arguments about what kind of white is white

1419
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,967
You see this idea pop up all the time

1420
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:22,367
Start talking about how Jews but they're not

1421
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,719
Because they said he thought they had dangerous Jewish and Asiatic

1422
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
They weren't wide enough

1423
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,815
This argument

1424
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
Cannibalizing

1425
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,679
Nature of white National

1426
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,215
Becomes a definition

1427
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,263
Sing it away that doesn't work

1428
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,823
Reality is or even

1429
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Like whiteness

1430
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,175
Exclusive

1431
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,479
It's always been an idea based on

1432
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Isn't White

1433
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
Who is

1434
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:51,807
And when you

1435
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,343
Well in that sort

1436
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
The world white Nash

1437
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,647
Symbolism

1438
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
Specific

1439
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
About retain

1440
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
Power

1441
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,999
In the people you.

1442
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
Be wide enough

1443
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,815
I don't believe

1444
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,607
Coach understand

1445
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,703
I really think you did

1446
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,983
Because

1447
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
Can hear it in his voice there's like

1448
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:16,896
You know I'm a white nationalist white and I'm a nationalist

1449
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
I don't think

1450
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,688
Understand

1451
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
There is

1452
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,248
I think that he's white Nash

1453
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
Nationalism

1454
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
As an idea

1455
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
I think he thinks

1456
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
Two discrete ideas

1457
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
Being white

1458
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,696
Which is just coincidence

1459
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,232
A big National

1460
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Position

1461
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,096
You're giving him a lot of the benefit of the doubt

1462
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,656
I've listened to enough of him to know that he's f****** stew

1463
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:39,936
That's true

1464
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:44,032
I also know that he's f****** stupid ass s***

1465
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
Huge bigot and I think

1466
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,616
He could accurately be described as a white

1467
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
He knows what that mean

1468
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
I think he

1469
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,016
A few of those things

1470
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:54,784
What does a

1471
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,576
He have done the homework

1472
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
Deserve

1473
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,648
My score

1474
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:06,048
On that okay

1475
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,864
But it's not from a place of like

1476
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,144
I think

1477
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
That he's fixed

1478
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,472
Something years old or whatever

1479
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,240
I don't think

1480
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
Videos Alzheimer

1481
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,896
You don't know what

1482
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,176
Put in the amount of work

1483
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,456
It's required to talk about this

1484
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,248
Subject right

1485
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,296
I think if we

1486
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,832
Much more work

1487
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,880
We can talk about the much deeper than we

1488
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,648
But

1489
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
Used

1490
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,952
Totally fine with

1491
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,744
Not even the surface

1492
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
The Ether

1493
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,096
Above

1494
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,144
Flowing wind

1495
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,168
Yeah yeah

1496
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,984
Next episode

1497
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
The end up talking about a source

1498
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
Information that

1499
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,872
This is America

1500
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,456
The new American is the John Birch

1501
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Body

1502
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,248
God God

1503
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
I'm on there

1504
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:06,976
Detroit Historical

1505
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,816
Other cities.

1506
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,656
Turn down the statue

1507
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,216
Anybody with me on that one

1508
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:17,984
You dumb f***

1509
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:24,384
Like sports Pacific statue of Margaret Sanger are you talking about

1510
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:30,784
Let's go with conservative Margaret Sanger

1511
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Statues

1512
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,576
Yeah all the time

1513
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,392
Anybody would be like

1514
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,672
Wouldn't end up in a fight

1515
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,976
Now there's the one in

1516
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,048
You know that Margaret Sanger statue that we don't

1517
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,888
Tons of markers

1518
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,960
F*** out of here with that stupid

1519
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,592
You're getting out of this singer statue in

1520
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,664
The famous One

1521
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:04,320
I'm not going to deny or somewhere where there is one or what

1522
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,088
Making him mad

1523
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,648
It's just the idea of her having a statue

1524
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,440
Welcome on the subject

1525
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
I'm f******

1526
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,488
Down with her having

1527
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,512
Statue

1528
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,840
He and I could get into an argument about why that's not relevant

1529
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,608
I just think he's

1530
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,656
Trying to pull some sort of name

1531
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
I bet

1532
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,472
You think there's a statue of somewhere

1533
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,240
In order to

1534
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
The beefed-up is clay

1535
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,544
Now hold on

1536
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,848
The John Birch Society put out this article

1537
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
In the new America

1538
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,944
Criticisms of this Robert

1539
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,736
Statue

1540
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,504
Express

1541
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,040
A misunderstanding

1542
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:41,440
About when I was about to start yelling thank you for stopping

1543
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,720
History

1544
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,168
And Charla

1545
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,216
Coatesville

1546
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,080
Revolving in a murder

1547
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:04,736
That is now legally confirmed he was convicted of murder

1548
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,832
Today he was convicted of murder

1549
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,112
Recorded this

1550
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:16,512
Sorry about that

1551
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,096
That the statue is at

1552
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:20,864
The heart of the matter

1553
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,936
He's reading the John Birch Society

1554
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,984
About historical

1555
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
Ignorant

1556
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,032
About

1557
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,336
We're also ignorant now here

1558
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,128
You starts to read from the article and

1559
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,152
Editorialize

1560
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,480

1561
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,504
About how

Charlottesville Virginia

1566
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,632
Remove the statue

1567
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,752
Miss Station Park yes that's why they were invented

1568
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,312
Property

1569
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,560
Well yeah

1570
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,096
I want to talk to you about the Statue

1571
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,960
The statue of Robert Ely that was erected in Charlottesville Virginia with commission

1572
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984

Food52

1574
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,544
Two years after the end of the Civil War

1575
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:36,128
Tenzin America interesting time from

1576
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,432
If I understand my

1577
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,992
History correctly there were a lot

1578
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
Statues

1579
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
Came up

1580
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,600
In the South around that time

1581
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:55,840
Arguments for why they should

1582
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
To continue

1583
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,960
The mistakes of that has you hit on to bigger point but let me walk us through it

1584
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,496
Sew in

1585
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,776
January 19th 6

1586
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Carter Woodson

1587
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,824
Inconsiderate

1588
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
Be the father of black history

1589
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,640
Founded the Journal of negro history

1590
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:11,200
In October 1960 Margaret Sanger

1591
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:11,968
Started her

1592
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,016
Brownsville Brooklyn

1593
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,064
Which aims to provide Healthcare to

1594
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,600
Impoverished largely non-white

1595
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,160
Community to give them control over their own bodies

1596
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
Choices

1597
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,464
Hey March 1917

1598
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
The Jones Act

1599
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,512
Did Puerto Ricans

1600
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
In July 19th 7

1601
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,840
30 day labor

1602

F-250

1603
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
Evil Dead

1604
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,472
In August 1917 the messenger

1605
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,032
An African American political and literary

1606
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
Begin District

1607
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,848
It was a wild time

1608
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
Significant progress has taken

1609
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,432
Place in terms of race relations

1610
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,504
And simultaneously there was still high-profile lynching

1611
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:49,088
And plenty of outright racist violence that was completely

1612
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
The issue here

1613
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,416
The time

1614
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,440
It was one where it was

1615
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,768
Moves are beginning to be made

1616
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
To empower the

1617
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,584
Disempowered disenfranchised communities

1618
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,632
Beginning create their own spaces

1619
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,656
These Publications

1620
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,704
Or Hubert Harrison up in Harlem

1621
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,520
But it was also a minority

1622
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,056
He was still totally okay

1623
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:13,152
In Birth of a Nation came out in 1915 which led to the founding

1624
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,176
The second planet that

1625
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,968
Barry Gibb

1626
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,016
So we're living in the aftermath

1627
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,808
And this is the stage upon which our play

1628
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,368
The statue of Robert

1629
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,440
As well as the accompanying statue of Stonewall Jackson

1630
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,000
Paul Goodloe

1631
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,792
The part that contains

1632
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,584
The statue was also paid for by Mackinac

1633
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
And it was called

1634
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,960
It wasn't renamed emancipation Park Until 27th

1635
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,752
The year that Charlottesville City

1636
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,288
The council voted to remove the

1637
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,104
So his whole propoint

1638
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,640
About the emancipation

1639
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:51,040
Part and they put up the main story

1640
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
F***

1641
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,856
So he's whole premises

1642
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:57,440
Completely blown out

1643
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
Yeah

1644
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,256
Yeah they renamed it emancipation Park

1645
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:06,656
In honoring of taking down the music

1646
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,960
Screaming about that nonsense I was like

1647
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:15,872
The only way that makes sense is if they made the park orwellian nonsense

1648
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,480
Everybody's like

1649
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:25,600
F*** around and make an ironic name called emancipation

1650
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:28,416
Empire

1651
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,352
McIntire University of Virginia history professors

1652
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,912
He was somebody who deeply believed in

1653
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,936
The cause of the South

1654
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:46,336
Was honorable the cause was honorable

1655
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,616
Heroic

1656
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:51,456
He was part and parcel of what historians now called the lost cause

1657
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:53,248
This idea of the noble South

1658
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,552
Which celebrates the romanticized

1659
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
The Confederacy

1660
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,136
Slavery

1661
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
Drift away the brutalities

1662
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:03,744
Slavery I can't imagine why they would want to be a heartbreaker

1663
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,024
Stripped Away all the ugly

1664
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,352
I don't get why we change that history

1665
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,168
Philanthropic

1666
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
McPherson who gave generously

1667
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,240
Towards the goal of beautifying the city

1668
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,008
Charlottesville

1669
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,312
It's important to point out that most

1670
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,360
The things he was paying for we're all set

1671
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,896
Beautify

1672
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
Charlottesville

1673
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
Lee Park

1674
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,992
Where the statue of Robert E Lee

1675
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,784
Was erected was a whites-only

1676
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,832
The same is true

1677
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,696
The same is true of Benny

1678
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,744
As Professor Mason puts it quote

1679
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,792
That new Public Library with secre

1680
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,584
He gave money to school

1681
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,864
The schools were psychic

1682
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,424
Everywhere you look McEntire's gif

1683
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,496
Well in the eyes of Charlottesville are beautifying

1684
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,288
Gloria

1685
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,360
If you look at them Through The Eyes of black Charlottesville

1686
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,896
Enhancing the segregation

1687
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,664
The public space

1688
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,944
I'm celebrating.

1689
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,968
Defense of slavery

1690
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,880
Beyond my knowledge to express that Paul McIntyre's

1691
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
Desire was to

1692
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,440
Participate in the systematic terrorizing

1693
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,976
Of the black population

1694
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
I was beginning to make progress towards greater

1695
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,536
Quality

1696
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,120
It's not beyond what I know to say that that's exactly the result

1697
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
Of his actions

1698
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,936
Widening the educational Gap

1699
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
White and black

1700
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,264
Creating beautiful public spaces were black

1701
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
Welcome

1702
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
Then in those supposed

1703
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,616
Beautiful faces created

1704
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,664
The revisionist history

1705
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
The history of the

1706
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,712
Enslavement of the what

1707
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,528
Parents of then residents of Charlottesville

1708
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,064
It's pure racial Terror

1709
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,344
There's no two ways about

1710
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,672
On some level I know that people like coach understand

1711
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,208
And they're carrying on that

1712
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,232
A tradition themselves

1713
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,768
They probably don't realize

1714
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,560
But I know on some visceral fat

1715
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,328
Conscious level

1716
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
They f******

1717
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
Absolutely

1718
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:49,472
And that's the historical truth of all this

1719
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Where there's smoke

1720
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,336
There's probably Nazis burning books

1721
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,360
The vault

1722
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,688
You talking about this John person the article about how they

1723
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,712
Revision of

1724
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:05,600
Historical ignorance about leaf

1725
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,648
Yeah that's the truth of that statue

1726
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
So what you going to do with that

1727
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,232
You just going to lie about it

1728
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
And you're going to argue that the ultimate big

1729
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Country in the world

1730
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,328
Is against

1731
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:28,640
Washington DC and George Soros and all those God hate us

1732
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:48,864
Preserve preserve the Heritage ultimate form of bigotry

1733
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,936
Taking the ultimate form of bigotry

1734
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
Ultimate

1735
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,872
Characterizing white people in the south

1736
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:02,176
As having strong

1737
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,200
And missing teeth

1738
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:09,344
Your type of his

1739
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:14,720
Especially if somebody from the heart of the Midwest and someone who's been to the south in like

1740
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:17,536
I don't fancy myself like a

1741
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:22,912
Like that

1742
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,472
Having grown up in the situation

1743
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,240
That I have

1744
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,520
Being so

1745
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,056
Inundated with

1746
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:35,712
People that most people think are Hillbillies sympathizer

1747
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:40,832
Insult

1748
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,880
No there's so much

1749
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
Believe that our culture

1750
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,464
As a whole

1751
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,488
Too much mileage

1752
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,024
Which out of making fun of

1753
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,048
Hillbilly

1754
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,144
Alicia little bit I just like

1755
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,704
I believe all heck jokes

1756
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:02,848
Like it might do us all a bit of good

1757
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,920
The only point of making

1758
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,200
Because I'm not going to validate

1759
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,992
But I do

1760
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,016
Either

1761
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,808
The kernel of a FairPoint

1762
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,112
A lot of angry White

1763
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,160
In that

1764
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:17,952
Punchline

1765
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,488
Has been totally fine

1766
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
Just because you walk around

1767
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,608
In Southend here Bunch people talking

1768
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,192
Doesn't mean that they're dumb

1769
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,728
It doesn't mean

1770
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,032
Me and that people are having lots of value

1771
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:35,104
You because of it your own

1772
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,128
Biases

1773
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
Is by

1774
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,176
Finding people who

1775
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,456
Fit close to stare

1776
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:43,040
Karyotypes right it goes unexamined

1777
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,832
The more for Hillbillies than others

1778
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
But

1779
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
Hillbillies

1780
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
It's not it's not the word I would like to

1781
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:55,072
Dwight Beverly

1782
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,264
The caricature of the

1783
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
It isn't on

1784
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,384
Fair Arkansas

1785
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:14,784
But somebody is going to end the world

1786
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,088
Look at how funny these people talk

1787
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:17,856
Let's make fun of

1788
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,672
Let me finish my thought

1789
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:24,256
What's going to be on the grand

1790
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,304
This one doesn't

1791
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,328
Underlie

1792
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
AAA

1793
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,120
Tradition

1794
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,400
Of Lexi

1795
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,216
Yeah I think

1796
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,264
Like we talked about triage

1797
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:40,896
There are there are 100 problem

1798
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,200
And we will times

1799
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
Not talking

1800
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,760
Catan about problems

1801
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,040
Because problem 12in

1802
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,856
Prescient

1803
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,904
I think it's that same sort of thing

1804
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,440
Now

1805
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,000
People like coach

1806
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:56,768
Probably argue

1807
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:03,168
You hit whitest number one problem but

1808
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,960
A little bit a little bit

1809
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:08,032
Clip from this episode

1810
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,824
The biggest boy that I want

1811
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
What the f***

1812
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,456
What that statue was what it

1813
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,248
Contact

1814
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,272
Evans Construction

1815
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,576
Like there's a bunch more of

1816
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
Statues

1817
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,880
By the daughters of

1818
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:27,232
Confederacy large

1819
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
Came up

1820
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,536
And were erected

1821
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,560
Did during.

1822
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,352
Where non-white pee

1823
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
Making inroads

1824
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,424
2 power

1825
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,960
An internet service

1826
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:38,240
It was used as a

1827
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,264
Terroristic

1828
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,056
It was a reminder of

1829
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,336
We enslave.

1830
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,384
Okay so what

1831
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,152
Is that

1832
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,200
During time.

1833
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,248
Where in America

1834
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,784
Traditional minority

1835
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,320
Make games

1836
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,112
And how they live their life

1837
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,440
I don't want to stay over react

1838
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:01,792
I'm going to instead

1839
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,352
In order to try and Destroy any games that are

1840
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,888
Memorialize

1841
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,168
Intimidating fashion

1842
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
Public space

1843
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,728
History of

1844
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,008
Repression

1845
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:13,824
History in order to make it look like

1846
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:18,176
The oppressors they were the oppressed

1847
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:18,944
The typewriter

1848
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,040
It's co-opting the very oppression that you are

1849
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,832
Statistically that does true

1850
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,624
One more clip

1851
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,648
I think

1852
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,696
What I made that argument

1853
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,488
When he started talking about how he's a white Nash

1854
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,256
Analyst

1855
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,792
I do believe

1856
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,096
He doesn't know what the term

1857
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,336
National if he thinks he's a white

1858
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,432
This clip better make my Ark

1859
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,712
You stupid

1860
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
It doesn't understand

1861
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,296
Conversation.

1862
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,928
Art of the deal

1863
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
Why

1864
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,024
Nationalist

1865
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:17,824
All white Nice List why they are they believe in white supremacy

1866
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,480
That we

1867
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,272
Do regarding women

1868
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,792
Understand that what is happening

1869
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,072
Is Brave

1870
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,096
Well that's not true

1871
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
Christian man

1872
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,680
When snow party

1873
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,480
He is going to

1874
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,528
Let the world go to hell

1875
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:07,744
Very very important for Soros

1876
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
True

1877
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,424
America first

1878
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:21,056
America first

1879
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,944
The windows white nationalist showed up

1880
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,368
Does white nationalist

1881
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:39,232
Give me drawing real quick

1882
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,912
Thinking America

1883
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,456
Who's on your team

1884
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,504
When you say team

1885
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,296
Includes your team

1886
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,320
I think that

1887
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,624
He thinks those nationalist as a noun

1888
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,440
Adjective that is.

1889
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,464
Describing vet

1890
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:16,096
That you just hear someone

1891
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
Doesn't understand

1892
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,936
Charlottesville there were

1893
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,960
White National

1894
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:26,080
There were groups

1895
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:28,640
Specifically white supremacist is there

1896
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,688
So because he's so stupid

1897
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,480
And he doesn't realize that

1898
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,016
What he wants

1899
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,296
Defend is National

1900
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,648
Right

1901
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,440
Spiritually

1902
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,720
What he's doing is

1903
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,304
Yeah I was going to say

1904
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:52,960
What he's I get that he's not understanding I mean I get that he's not understanding the term

1905
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,776
Structure

1906
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,312
But he is espousing

1907
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,872
Be very belief Smith

1908
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:04,480
You bet he is saying that he's not a white nationalist

1909

Civil rights

1936

1938
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,832

Possible

Look more into and enjoy be

1949
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
Because

1950
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,776
That there is a

1951
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
Chasm

1952
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,592
Between reality and what

1953
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:07,872
Understanding

1954
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,896
Yeah that interest

1955
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,432
It is interesting

1956
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:14,784
Give me that he expresses very clearly white nationalist position right

1957
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,088
Talk about how I am a white nationalist

1958
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:21,696
He doesn't know what he's doing

1959
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:22,976
And

1960
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,512
Brash like

1961
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,816
The conference

1962
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:27,840
Is interesting

1963
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,656
People who have

1964
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:37,312
Hundreds of hours of episodes available for me to look at

1965
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,408
Almost

1966
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,648
Color it's

1967
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:55,232
Weirdly ready like

1968
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:01,632
People want me to watch them

1969
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:06,496
Have you ever seen about white nationalist

1970
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
You know that

1971
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,944

1973
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,576
Unfortunately

1974
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,112
We have one more

1975
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:22,880
Clips

1976
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,904
The coaches put out

1977
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,208
And in this could you call this clipper

1978
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,328

Nscorp

1980
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:34,400
It becomes clear that coaches

1981
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
A little bit of a fee

1982
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,728
Also

1983
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,008
In his defense

1984
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,312
If you are a coach

1985
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,592
It does seem to run

1986
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:45,920
Counter parallel to

1987
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:52,832

My friend the reason

This is very

2034
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,008
It's things that we see

2035
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,800
In the world like a foster

2036
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,896
They were pretending

2037
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
To be moral

2038
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,688
Moralizing

2039
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:58,272
People advertising sex work online

2040
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:02,368
They wind up doing is demonizing sex workers and

2041
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:08,000
Where is someone

The result

2044
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,840
Yep incredibly difficult

2045
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,912
Newton horses

Safe spaces on

Yep

2052
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,360
Creates an incentive

2053
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,640
Attempts to show up

2054
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,432

What did he say

2057
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,016
Doing is trying

2058
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,552
Create this Borel

2059
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,832
Idea about life

2060
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:36,416
Get rid of

2061
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:39,488
Dysfunctional reality is what he's advik

2062
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,512
4

2063
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,048
Further

2064
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
Wayward

2065
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:43,840
Worse

2066
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,608
Victims

2067
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960

Policy

2069
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,032
I am

2070
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:58,688
Tax cuts are the way to go now admittedly every time we run one of these

2071
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,712
Is Matt the tax cut

2072
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:05,600
It creates a massive government ultimately hate but ideologically we still have to support

2073
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:12,768
We hate abortion murder of unborn fetuses

2074
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:17,120
Birth control because that's the same thing

2075
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:23,520
Leads to more murders of unborn fetuses

2076
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:26,848
Of course that leads to more illegal

2077
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,896
And it leads to more death but

2078
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,176
Ideological

2079
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:33,504
It sounds right

2080
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,296
Truly look at the results

2081
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:37,600
Of the dumb s*** we believe

2082
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:42,720
Otherwise we would have to accept the worsening

2083
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:47,840
Of the s*** that we desire for control is real

2084
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:51,168
The fake reasons we are saying we are

2085
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,216
Things to happen

2086
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:59,360
Baseline Hayward America

2087
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,664
America

2088
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,224
What is

2089
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,248
Problem with foreign

2090
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:06,784
It is

2091
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,064
Consensual Act

2092
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,112
Queen adult regulator

2093
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:14,720
Regulation but we need to regulate

2094
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:18,304
Between adults can't be video tape for other people's enjoyment

2095
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:27,008
Crazy slippery slope

2096
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,032
So it's not

2097
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:32,896
Anyways approaches expresses that he hangs out exclusively with Liars

2098
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,456
I wonder if we were doing

2099
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:37,248
Local church

2100
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:43,648
If you go into any local businesses and if you were able to get an honest survey

2101
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:47,232
Business or in that church

2102
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:50,048
A regular viewer

2103
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,888
Nothing

2104
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:59,776
Dark secret isn't it kind of except in open

2105
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:02,848
Pornography

2106
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:09,248
Set the end result of pornography and most cases are looking at pornography

2107
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,296
Unless masturbation

2108
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:18,208
Snowman talk about that no man is probably saving that does that

2109
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:23,072
This is crazy this is a lunatic

2110
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,704
A lot of people like to talk about it

2111
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:34,848
A lot of people enjoy it when you talk about it also remember that

2112
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,152
Like I'm not so old

2113
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,432
I'm not so young

2114
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,968
But I don't remember

2115
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:42,272
The function of whatever

2116
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:47,136
Being very tubu invite High School

2117
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,768
Everyone pretended they didn't masturbating didn't look at 4

2118
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,304
But as you got older it's

2119
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,328
It's certainly not

2120
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,632
The most polite topic of conversation

2121
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,912
Feel like you and I are

2122
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,680
Good friends

2123
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:06,080
But if we go out and get a drink I'm not going to be coming up towards

2124
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:13,760
I'm not going to create a false reality

2125
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,040
I think he's lives in this

2126
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:19,392
Weird false reality where everyone's like absolutely

2127
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:26,560
Wow you're wrestling with your your addiction and I

2128
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:31,168
Publicly you trying to do much weirder than that

2129
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,728
Your your clothes but it's

2130
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,008
Stories

2131
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:40,128
So crazy last clip

2132
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,664
And it's where

2133
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,432
Cerakote

2134
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
Makes his up

2135
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:45,248
About his position

2136
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,528
Pornography and how Danger

2137
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,832
But even worse than that

2138
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:53,184
Pornography is destroying this land is destroying families

2139
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:55,232
It's destroying careers

2140
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:58,560
It's destroying oh my goodness our young people

2141
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:02,656
I remember when you used to be standards in iMovie that you just

2142
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:05,984
R-rated neighbor Jeep

2143
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:10,848
The stuff that comes across a movie screen is just unbelievably City

2144
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:15,200
But if you like me happen to be somebody who enjoys

2145
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:21,600
Research on the computer

2146
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:28,000
His final answer the banned pornography Society

2147
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:31,072
Passing of people who merely view pornography

2148
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:40,544
What are finding their lives ruined

2149
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,944
Because of an addiction that got the cleanup.

2150
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,968
Apple types of

2151
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:55,392
Pornography is a greatest Scourge in America and I States time for us

2152
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:59,232
As a God-fearing decent people

2153
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:05,632
Once again banned pornography that you really need

2154
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:08,960
The format in the phrase of a question otherwise it's not a correct answer

2155
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,800
Coach's comments about Bernard

2156
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,824
Murphy and write them off

2157
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,360
The right-wing Christian

2158
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
Fundamental

2159
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,664
Doesn't want anyone

2160
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:18,688
Macaron morel

2161
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,456
Choices

2162
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:21,248
However there's a larger

2163
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,016
My coach has

2164
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,040
Specific

2165
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,320
Complaints about pornography

2166
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:28,416
Kirby azenzone pornography

2167
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,280
Why is he saying the people are going to jail for looking at pornography

2168
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:39,680
That's absolutely not true unless the pornography

2169
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:41,216
People all my God

2170
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,008
Holyshit

2171
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,056
Here's the Joe Paterno Jesus

2172
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,616
In that one clip

2173
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,152
We f****** curious as hell

2174
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:55,296
Yeah people going to jail for pornography

2175
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,576
It made me

2176
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,624
Oh no

2177
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:06,304
2007 coaches on Plano Road

2178
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:11,424
Having a minor legal language caught with child pronography

2179
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:17,824
Coaches son's computer broke and when it was taken into the shop a bunch of pornography featuring underage girls was found on

2180
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:19,360
And the repairman called the

2181
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:23,712
According to police 37 still images in 26 movies

2182
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:27,040
The files were labeled in such a way as to make it very clear

2183
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,064
That any person

2184
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,136
Who had those files on their computer could not be unaware

2185
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,160
That they featured illegal

2186
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,976
He was sentenced to five years probation

2187
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:35,744
Can you put on the sex

2188
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,304
Who is credit coaches son

2189
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,352
To the probation engaged and Rehabilitation

2190
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:43,680
From all sources I can find included testimony from his therapist

2191
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:46,496
He dealt with the underlying issues and has never really

2192
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,800
None of that is to let him off the hook

2193
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:52,896
It's just to say that he was a super privilege kid who ended up being given a chance

2194
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,176
To save his own life

2195
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,200
You didn't respond

2196
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
Now

2197
01:53:56,992 --> 01:54:00,064
This is most of the information that's available from court records

2198
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:02,112
But I found a different

2199
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,928
Light on to the case of coaches

2200
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,720
This isn't going to go well

2201
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,488
He been a teacher

2202
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,608
Which obviously know this is super not going to go well now he obviously had to

2203
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:15,424
Quit that job when he was arrested for possession

2204
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,472
So you need to find a new career

2205
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,008
Coach got a job as a

2206
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,032
Administrative

2207
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,056
Search for a lawyer that he knew

2208
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,104
Coach's son began to find a passion

2209
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:23,872
A lot

2210
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:27,200
He went on to study and attended law school graduating in 2011

2211
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:29,504
At that point you have to apply to take

2212
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,272
Take the bar exam

2213
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:32,320
Which percent problem

2214
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:34,368
That had to be decided by the

2215
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,648
Supreme Court of Ohio

2216
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:38,976
You can't be a sex offender and a lawyer at the same time

2217
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:42,304
You see the issue was with the Ohio bar didn't allow mission

2218
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,632
Quote who has been convicted

2219
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
Money before the

2220
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:48,448
Candidate is released from parole probation

2221
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,472
Community Control

2222
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,264
Post-release control or prison

2223
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,592
Rule however does not mandate the disapproval of

2224
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,360
Applicants

2225
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,152
Remain obligated

2226
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:57,920
Asterisk

2227
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,200
Sanders

2228
01:54:59,456 --> 01:54:59,968
Therap

2229
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:04,576
Locations cuz nobody thought that would be an issue this was a technicality that they do

2230
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:09,184
Didn't know what to do with desiccation and the results of that investigation

2231
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:09,952
Are public

2232
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,768
From this document you find that it wasn't

2233
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
Does this guy have any

2234
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,888
Legal pornography

2235
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:22,240
Thawed out coaches Donovan downloading trading and Sherry legal

2236
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,264
5 years

2237
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,032
At the point when he was

2238
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:26,080
Boy they found

2239
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,616
He committed his offense as an adult

2240
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:31,200
And despite his professed interest in videos depicting underage girls

2241
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
Naked girls

2242
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:36,576
Some of the files bad person you're involved

2243
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:40,416
Young children young children

2244
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:46,304
F****** Christ ultimately decided to his application

2245
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:52,448
We are also concerned that even as a college student daubenmeyer fail to appreciate

2246
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,216
Appreciate the gravity

2247
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:54,496
Visconti

2248
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
Or the fact

2249
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:58,080
The children depicted in those illegal materials were in

2250
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,128
In fact victims of his conduct

2251
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:02,432
Until after he was caught holyshit

2252
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,480
Clear the

2253
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,760
Really bad stuff

2254
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:08,064
But this isn't about coach's son

2255
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,088
It's about coach

2256
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,928
Any investigation regarding coaches son's application

2257
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:14,976
For the bar his therapist Candice Rising

2258
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,768
Was interviewed and she said the follow

2259
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:21,376
Based on her she believed that there were two

2260
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,144
Primary

2261
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,960
First you believe that his repressed upbringing

2262
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,240
Cost of 26

2263
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,264
Experience vicarious

2264
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,288
Rather than engage

2265
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,312
An age-appropriate

2266
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:30,592
Yes course

2267
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:34,688
She also found that he had developed anger toward and resentment of his father

2268
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,784
And who would have been subject to embarrassed

2269
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,320
He failed to live up to those

2270
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,880
You're no such things make

2271
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,160
Clearwire coach thanks

2272
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,184
The band Foreigner

2273
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,976
And it's not because of God

2274
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,024
It's because it's a convenient way

2275
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:50,816
Hot to address

2276
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,352
The issues of his life without having

2277
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,888
To wrestle with the possibility

2278
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,192
Is raising his kids and it'll be

2279
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:57,984
That leads to

2280
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:58,752
This sort of thing

2281
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,544
I don't get none of this is to

2282
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,824
His son off the hook

2283
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,128
And the reason I'm referring to him as coaches.

2284
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,432
There's no need to put it

2285
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,736
Right there's no anybody

2286
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,272
I can find it. It's all public and all that

2287
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,832
But I'm not here to beat up on his son

2288
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,624
I mean I think he's awful and

2289
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,904
This is terrible

2290
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,672
Terrible

2291
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,696
Terrible Behavior

2292
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:18,720
I do

2293
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:20,768
Appreciate the idea that has been rebuilt

2294
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,864
Is possible and all that

2295
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,912
That that's great but

2296
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:29,472
The reality of the situation is coaches

2297
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,520
Coming out he's expressing this thing of

2298
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:33,312
We need to ban pornography

2299
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:34,592
And who pitched

2300
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:37,152
Banning something

2301
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,432
Adult

2302
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,736
Each other

2303
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:43,040
And a lot of people really sucking in Troy

2304
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,064
It doesn't

2305
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,344
Anybody Annex

2306
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,648
Really helps a lot of people

2307
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,416
City putting out until

2308
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,440
The world specifically

2309
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,720
Sex worker

2310
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,048
By and large women

2311
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,328
There are men

2312
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:56,608
It's a lot of with

2313
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,144
And

2314
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:00,704
The reason that

2315
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,472
He's doing it

2316
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,264
Very clear

2317
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:04,544
When you look into

2318
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:05,312
Just passed

2319
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
And his life

2320
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:09,920
Because it's

2321
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:10,944
He had a prince

2322
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,784
In the middle of his pitch to

2323
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,808
Pornography

2324
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,088
He wouldn't stay

2325
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,368
They're sending people to

2326
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,136
The jail for

2327
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,160
Viewing pornography

2328
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,464
Because that's what they do when

2329
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:23,232
People View

2330
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,000
Illegal Toronado

2331
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,792
Which is what his son was

2332
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:26,816
Was doing 45

2333
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,912
He doesn't have a point

2334
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,192
He's acting out

2335
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:34,752
That's f***** up

2336
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:37,056
8

2337
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:39,616
In a way that is

2338
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,176
Even

2339
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:49,856
Certain extent like of course you empathize with this kid cuz his dad is this f****** guy

2340
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:56,000
In the same way that you emphasized with the serial killer when he's like 9 years old and his abuse is rampant

2341
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,792
And rice and Munster

2342
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:00,864
And you like I empathize with you but at the same time

2343
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,240
A lot of people get abused and don't turn into pedophiles

2344
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:12,384
A lot of people are pedophiles and unfortunately the way that human sexuality works you don't always get

2345
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:16,992
And I don't f****** know

2346
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,272
Fuckedupshit

2347
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:22,112
And I don't

2348
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:26,464
God I want a simple thing where I can just

2349
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,512
Be like

2350
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:33,376
He's turning it into something where it's like

2351
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:35,168
This whole thing is

2352
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,448
Not an issue

2353
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:38,752
With an issue is I get to say

2354
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,032
This is the problem

2355
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:46,432
And I have the solution it'll never be a problem again

2356
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:48,480
Personal life isn't

2357
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:53,088
He's putting Lake in order

2358
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,624
To create ways to

2359
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:55,648
Advocate

2360
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,464
Controlling other people's lives

2361
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,512
Exactly

2362
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,536
Send the other thing

2363
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:04,096
There was another clip I was going to play but it

2364
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,120
Just felt stupid

2365
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:09,728
And that was a video coach put out about how the pedophiles

2366
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:12,544
In the same way that Alex

2367
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:15,616
And when you see the reality of like

2368
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,408
Your son was arrested

2369
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,176
For sharing

2370
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,200
C*********

2371
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,760
In 45 years

2372
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,784
Computer broken

2373
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
Realize

2374
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,576
They would find it when

2375
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:27,136
Jesus

2376
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,160
He probably wouldn't

2377
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:28,928
Have stopped

2378
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:29,696
If the computer hadn't

2379
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,464
Broken

2380
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,512
If you had been caught I would you

2381
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:33,792
Him trying to

2382
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,560
Create this

2383
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:37,632
Very Alex Jones via Narrative of the pedophiles are

2384
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:41,472
Is very hard to look at

2385
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:43,008
And then at the same time

2386
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,288
I know we talked about this

2387
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,824
He started that

2388
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,848
Minutemen

2389
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,616
A group

2390
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,920
Yep that advocated for Roy Moore

2391
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,456
And spoiler alert

2392
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:54,016
After all the news came out about Roy Moore

2393
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,064
He put out videos

2394
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,624
With Roy Moore

2395
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:03,232
So when you look at the concrete reality of situation

2396
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,048
Yeah

2397
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,608
Pretending that he's on the right side but

2398
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:10,144
Everything is wrong

2399
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,168
Everything

2400
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
Everything

2401
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:16,800
His idea historical context

2402
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,080
Charlottesville

2403
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:20,896
Slavery in the Civil Rights is f****** stupid

2404
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,432
His position on

2405
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,968
Pornography can't be

2406
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,248
Because he

2407
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
Clearly is

2408
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:26,784
Is acting out

2409
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,320
Some sort of unresolved feelings

2410
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:29,088
He has about his

2411
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,880
You can't f******

2412
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:32,160
Listen to him about them

2413
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:32,928
Mandela effect

2414
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:35,488
You shouldn't

2415
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,536
Except

2416
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:42,144
Accredited psychologists study a memory like

2417
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:49,568
It is a mess this guy is a tremendous

2418
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,944
It needs all the worst

2419
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,224
It's all the worse

2420
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:56,992
Cuz he's

2421
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:58,784
So clearly just

2422
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,064
F****** stupid

2423
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:00,832
Is very stew

2424
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:02,368
8 is all the work

2425
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:08,768
He would if you would to be fine with whatever

2426
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:12,096
This man

2427
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:13,632
He would never have said

2428
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:15,168
People are going to jail

2429
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,960
At pornography

2430
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,520
Strong indication

2431
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:20,544
F****** stew

2432
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,848
Because that's what's underneath

2433
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,176
Done

2434
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:29,248
Got in legal trouble for looking at child pronography

2435
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:32,320
Really should have just happened is it should have been

2436
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:34,368
Except for what

2437
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,648
And it is

2438
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:36,928
And

2439
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:37,952
That's the problem

2440
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:43,584
Is in place

2441
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,776
About these I'm angry at my son

2442
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,056
Ecology

2443
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
For me

2444
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,640
Because I consider him an extension of myself

2445
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:58,944
Yeah and that's one of the reasons why

2446
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,224
Winfield

2447
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,504
Talkin about this

2448
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,296
I don't want to see his son

2449
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,064
Because it's

2450
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,136
So it's not like

2451
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,928
It's not like

2452
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:10,208
What his son did

2453
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,280
Eating pork

2454
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,560
Because it informs

2455
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,328
Is rhetoric

2456
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,936
And the way he puts it is that it's not

2457
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:20,960
Something

2458
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:24,544
The way he puts it is that it is something that is

2459
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,336
Happening to him

2460
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:28,384
In a larger sense

2461
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,920
Not even like

2462
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:43,232
Condemning his son along with it

2463
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:45,024
Is a condemnation of

2464
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:49,376
Every other thing on this f****** planet

2465
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:55,776
Is probably the most by George Soros

2466
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:58,592
There was there was a papa

2467
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,128
That came on it

2468
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,920
Computer and he got addicted to pornography

2469
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,200
Murphy and then what are you

2470
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:05,504
Yep it has nothing to do with

2471
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,808
Everything is about personal choice

2472
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:10,368
Except for when my family does something

2473
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:13,696
That is their personal choice that went badly

2474
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:22,656
Create near fascistic laws about what adults can do with each other

2475
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:29,056
Kid safe dance

2476
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:34,176
What's velvet there was still a hammer to come in

2477
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:36,736
So if you got

2478
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:39,040
Having said all that we have

2479
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,320
There's more

2480
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:43,136
If it's coach basket that week

2481
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,696
If you want us to

2482
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:47,488
We are we may do that

2483
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:49,536
I think that he is a fertile soil

2484
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,304
In terms of

2485
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,120
The amount of content that's out there

2486
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,144
And a couple of things

2487
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,424
Songs that I know

2488
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:56,960
How do upset

2489
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:58,496
I would be

2490
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:00,032
Fine with doing

2491
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:02,336
Future episodes of coach

2492
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:05,920
Doing this episode

2493
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:18,464
Peeling off of the Band-Aid

2494
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:22,048
We hope you enjoyed this episode

2495
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,912
Sorry also

2496
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:30,240

2498
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,808
Keep on doing it

2499
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:44,576
Exact

2500
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:48,416
Should have last week's

2501
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,264
One week

2502
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:06,592
This crazy preacher who wants to murder gay people

2503
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,616
Second week

2504
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:10,432
Crystal child who makes good

2505
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:16,832
Who's the murderer

2506
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:23,232
Wacky Wednesday is getting real

2507
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:27,328
It's crazy

2508
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,352
That might be better

2509
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:33,472
So anyway I don't want

2510
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:43,968
Charles from Final Table never killed anybody

2511
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:46,272
Is it

2512
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:48,320
Express beautiful art through food

2513
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:50,368
It was so great to weigh that Charles

2514
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:52,160
Charles especially would like

2515
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:52,928
Pay homage

2516
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:54,208
Do the ingredients

2517
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:57,536
Did he was using

2518
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:00,608
The seed for this

2519
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,376
F******

2520
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:03,424
Superb noxious

2521
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,264
Irreverent to me and I love it

2522
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,800
Just Express themselves

2523
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,336
Through that Avenue though

2524
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:12,128
They also expressed

2525
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:12,896
Advocate

2526
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:18,784
Renewable food store solutely vegetarian food sources

2527
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:26,464
Like I think in the first episode they made whatever

2528
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:29,024
Yeah they were trying to

2529
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:35,168
Do alternative Pro Take Back Time making delicious food they were awesome

2530
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:39,776
They never killed anybody had kids did not kill anybody

2531
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:42,848
Technically

2532
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:43,872
Probably

2533
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,968
Holding

2534
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:53,600
