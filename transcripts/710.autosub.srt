1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge but now it's like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Facebook.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody welcome back to another episode of knowledge fight I'm Dan

00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
The Elder of Selene from afar while we're in this hotel room Alex Jones

6
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,752
Question for you

7
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
My bright spot Jordan is going to steal yours

8
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,552
Robert Barnes on Twitter

9
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,648
I thought there was going to be for sure

10
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
Yeah and Infowars character accidentally stepped into your Twitter mentioned it down it and got blown up with all people

11
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
Getting ratioed

12
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,592
Nickname that is that belittling and then step into that Arena that would be me I would avoid that

13
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
It was it was fun to see of all the Twitter nonsense that you're getting into that it was definitely a peek

14
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
What about you

15
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
Bio bright spots or my

16
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
Dark spots I don't know

17
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,744
Whatever it is we found out today

18
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
That's

19
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
The man

20
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
The myth the legend

21
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,656
Will be testifying in open court

22
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
Tomorrow Alex Jones is supposed to take the stand in the trial

23
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Episodes coming out

24
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
And you would think

25
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Cuz here's why it's my birthday

26
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,480
Because if you were a wise man

27
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
Who is going to testify in your own behalf

28
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,624
You would absolutely stick to what you said in your deposition

29
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Dust

30
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Proving that you are not a liar

31
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
But seems like it's going to be tough

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh yeah

33
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
A lot of things I'm at deposition

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Yeah I think that'll be wild to see and expect

35
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
I think I'm going to shave my beard so I can achieve super Incognito we should definitely be doing that

36
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,784
I will be there in the other side

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Do Jordan today about what's going on on Alex's show

38
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
But it'll be fun to have

39
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,328
I guess come in and talk about the goings-on here in the trial

40
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
Experiences at the coverage

41
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
Yes but not in the room with us.

42
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,272
Are welcoming back to the podcast

43
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
Hey guys

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,440
Now let me ask you this what is your bright spot

45
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
Oh my gosh

46
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Okay

47
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,608
So completely

48
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Was that

49
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
For the first time

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Since I've been here which is

51
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Almost a week

52
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
I did get out for a run

53
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Morning

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
And it was

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Only 90 is opposed

56
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:03,456
201/2 you must have gone to that run at like 3 a.m. or something

57
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
6:30

58
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
I would have 110 by then

59
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,696
And I have to say by the end it was getting

60
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Spell

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Temperature

62
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
Totally well congratulations on mustering the the drive to do that I've been telling myself I'm going to go

63
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,519
Go to the gym in our hotel for a week

64
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
I've been saying it for a week instead

65
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,455
I have s'mores snack mix I'm glad you enjoyed me about

66
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
The shameful moment where I went out

67
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
To go for running

68
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,255
And I told you there is no shade away from being elf

69
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Did you really

70
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Would you get

71
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
At the Voodoo Doughnut

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,167
So they have a limited edition banana cream

73
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Thai Donuts

74
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
Is a lot of trucks

75
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
A little bit better about myself so it's

76
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,271
Voodoo Donuts version of a salad

77
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Cinnamon cake Donuts

78
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
Oh yeah I got this i got this peanut butter banana thing that's blood

79
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
Elvis situation no idea but it was the size of a horse's flank

80
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Like it was absurd

81
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,007
To try and fit that anywhere near my

82
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
I'm ashamed to say that over

83
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
Two days I ate a third of it

84
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,319
That I couldn't really finish it and then I didn't know what to do with it because

85
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
I didn't want to throw it into the hotel

86
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231
Smile like a donut

87
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Toilet

88
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
I thought this was going to be a I threw it off that's helping my situation

89
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
Allusion to the problem

90
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,391
Cutting out the middleman right

91
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,303
Bat is cracked alligators got a little bit bigger yesterday

92
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Camaro smell like

93
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
I personally can't get away from the O Captain my Captain the Captain Crunch donut and

94
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
I hate myself every single time

95
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
It's good I eat it

96
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
When you're standing in that line

97
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
You don't really know unless you

98
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
You did a QR code which I'm not very good at

99
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
Your choices are so I'm looking at the sort of revolving you know that old school Bakery

100
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,327
Diner revolving display

101
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
To the checkout

102
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
All right what do I choose what do I choose

103
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Stressful moment so

104
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
I did

105
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Tell you something in a non misogynist way I'm going to do my best to do this okay they deliver baby

106
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Yeah

107
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
A door

108
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,415
Yeah I had to do that myself cuz I I couldn't

109
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Handle

110
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,303
Well basically the moment they're describing was the kid in the candy store but

111
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,655
I'm not a kid I'm not going to let you bring it to my home

112
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,055
It was kind of fun though to go there early in the morning

113
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,431
Really want to get there

114
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
Before the line forms

115
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
People who

116
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
Waiting for you

117
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
To buy them one and give it

118
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
The monster

119
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,023
Beat when I was in town for the depositions I went there at night

120
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
I went there at like

121
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,399
After we'd all got done with everything I think it was probably like 11

122
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Sun or something

123
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
And there were just drunk people hanging out really weird

124
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Party time place

125
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,247
I'm not sure that's what I want after a big night stays open past 11

126
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
You are giving drunk people don't

127
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
That's your business model I want I want

128
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Nachos

129
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Oh my God

130
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
I think just created a situation as Dan a heart attack and two years chili mac chili

131
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,151
There's a million-dollar idea Lanes killed if you've killed my best friend how dare you

132
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
So good so good

133
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Mac and cheese

134
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,183
Alright lose we are here not just for donuts although

135
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,559
They are more positive in many ways than a lot of the other stuff that's that's happening in town

136
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,239
Subject you got a greener pastures flushing Donuts

137
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
But don't do that

138
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Episode

139
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
Hey listen you didn't tell us everybody I know I'm human

140
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
Cool monster waltzes a cluster donut

141
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Destroy the environment around the plumbing

142
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
Good good

143
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
That is how much we don't want to get to the trial is that we almost got there and then immediately were like

144
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
So

145
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
I wanted to ask you a little bit because we're all in town

146
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Experience

147
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
This mistrial

148
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Far more professional capacity than us

149
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,727
You also have had more experience on

150
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
This story in particular you're following the Sandy Hook story

151
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
Came out recently

152
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,039
Cliche you literally wrote the book on this case

153
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,879
Yeah how you've experienced it

154
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
So far

155
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
So

156
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
You know I'm worried about

157
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Definitely

158
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
The plight of the families

159
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
And got to know them

160
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Pretty well

161
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
And today you know

162
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Listening to

163
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Mr. Crouch

164
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Therapist

165
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Who has worked with

166
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Neil heslin and Scarlett Lewis

167
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
I did have a couple moments where I was

168
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,535
Really got a little bit emotional about

169
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
How to say about their struggle

170
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Describe the sort of

171
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Two bucket

172
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
One you lose your son in a mass shooting

173
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Second bucket

174
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
People call you a liar and

175
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Say that

176
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Not only

177
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,711
Boise not killed in that way that he never existed

178
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
And at one point

179
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
Mr. Crouch the therapist was being

180
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
Prompted to say

181
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
Well what does that actually mean

182
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
The parent your kind of dealing with

183
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
And he said you know is just in

184
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
So important

185
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
To kneel and Scarlett

186
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Jesse's parents that

187
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
He matter

188
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
You know that

189
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
That this was

190
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
And and Jessie in particular

191
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
Has a very particular narrative

192
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
And that's that

193
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
You know she

194
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
When the gunman entered his classroom

195
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
Started shooting there was a pause

196
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
In the shooting where

197
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Either the magazine

198
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Or he was

199
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Reloading

200
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Jesse yelled run

201
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
And 9 children ran

202
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Survived

203
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Yeah

204
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:31,359
And so you know one thing that I'm sure that Neil and Scarlett will speak about is that

205
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
He was actually given

206
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Fallen heroes

207
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Funeral

208
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Because

209
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Please

210
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
You do recognize that as of

211
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Heroism

212
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
The children who survived

213
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
Said what had happened and that's how they knew

214
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
So

215
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
That part of his life

216
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Is

217
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
Tremendous

218
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Important

219
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
To kneel and Scarlett as you can

220
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Imagine

221
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,007
Yeah I miss idea that that would be taken from

222
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
The first thing that

223
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
Both told me them separately

224
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
The first thing they told me

225
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Was

226
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
That story

227
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
And so it's so important

228
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
From them

229
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,463
You know in their their therapist obviously

230
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Described

231
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
Well it is

232
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
It's like saying

233
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
You know it's

234
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
It's taking that last bit

235
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Did that someone would kill

236
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
2

237
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,263
These were his final moments he was

238
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Spine

239
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
Child and end

240
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Saved his class

241
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
It's in his final moments

242
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
And to think that

243
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Someone

244
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
In order to

245
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
So

246
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Or

247
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
You know

248
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Would take that

249
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
Shred from you is right

250
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,351
You know the the thing that got me about that is

251
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
The the therapist

252
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,031
As much and as powerful as that story was

253
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
When he was asked

254
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
What's the most important

255
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,663
Sing to the parents what's the most important thing

256
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
To them

257
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
He didn't say that

258
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,343
His he was remembered as a hero or he was remembered as somebody who saved anybody

259
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
He choked up

260
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
And he said the most important thing to me

261
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
Are the most important thing to the parents

262
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
Is just to let people know to let the world know

263
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
That he lived

264
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
That he matters

265
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Yep

266
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
Was when I actually

267
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Did have to

268
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
Look down and compose myself

269
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,991
I cried like a baby I was in my hotel room I didn't have to worry about people like judging me in the courtroom

270
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Weeping uncontrollably

271
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Because

272
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Those words

273
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,487
Were veronique De la Rosa

274
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,815
Who is the mother of Noah Pozner who's the youngest Sandy Hook

275
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Victim

276
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
The shooting she said

277
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
The same thing

278
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
To Anderson

279
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
Thank you for an interview

280
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
People to know that he

281
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
You know and that

282
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
I don't know something about

283
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
To take these here

284
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
But take your time

285
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Formulation

286
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Is

287
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
You know

288
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
It just

289
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
How much is

290
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
From you

291
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
When you lose

292
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
A loved one in this way

293
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Particularly your child

294
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
You're then

295
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Yourself saying

296
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Really

297
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
That just speaks

298
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
To the utter desolation

299
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
These parents must

300
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,975
Yeah I found it almost everything

301
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
That went on today

302
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Quite heavy

303
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
Yeah of course

304
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
For a lot of those boots

305
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,727
Same reasons we're touching on

306
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
And there's one reason that

307
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
I think I want to I want to ask you about a couple of questions about the

308
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
The trial just because

309
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
After we heard that testimony

310
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,295
We also saw the way that the defense behave

311
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,159
In their cross-examination and how the the judge

312
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
Was not happy with their behavior

313
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,047
Did you did you experience that in in that kind of way

314
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Yeah

315
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,631
And so here's an interesting so

316
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
As you can well imagine there are a lot of lawyers in these parts who are watching this trial

317
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
As we know it

318
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
I don't want of them was fighting with Jordan on Twitter earlier

319
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
Hell yeah yeah

320
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,903
Also a lot of regular lawyers

321
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,255
Are watching this and are just riveted by this

322
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Because

323
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
It's such a challenging case

324
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,191
The family's lawyers obviously

325
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
Certainly Sir Alex Jones this lawyers

326
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,383
But they were saying you know

327
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,759
One of the things that you know the unenviable position that Alex Jones is lawyer is in

328
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Is that

329
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
She of course

330
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Cannot attack

331
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,135
Niall and Scarlett when they testified

332
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Tomorrow

333
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
So the alternative that he has is

334
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
2 attack

335
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
Drlupo

336
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
6 psychiatrist who had

337
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
You Know spoken with them

338
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
And to attack Mr Crouch their act

339
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Sexual therapist

340
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
So it's

341
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
You know lower steak

342
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
2

343
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
Try and impeach them

344
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
To go head-to-head

345
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Course

346
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
With

347
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Jesse's

348
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,063
So so that was sort of interesting

349
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Because

350
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
The therapist

351
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Mr. Crouch was

352
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
So

353
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,071
Kind of a sympathetic character himself I mean he actually filled up with

354
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
When he said that about

355
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
He mattered

356
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
You know she was filling up

357
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Yourself and

358
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
Ghetto he obviously

359
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
Feels very deeply

360
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Yo for Neyland

361
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,431
Scarlett and for Jesse Evans and JC his older brother

362
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
And so

363
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,575
I think it was a lot more difficult than they had anticipated this wasn't

364
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Somebody who is

365
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
Very much

366
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Infested

367
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
In the plight of this

368
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
And I think that made it

369
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Supertop

370
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Uncrossed

371
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
Come back and say

372
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Manual

373
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
DSM-5

374
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Was just

375
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,175
My favorite thing that I think is ever happened

376
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,247
I've ever seen an acorn look like you just Googled something

377
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,855
He tried to he tried to catch so what happened was

378
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,511
He was trying to catch the defense lawyer

379
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,095
The serapis

380
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
In like a

381
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,471
You don't know the exact definition of PTSD do you

382
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,591
So the first thing you did was he tried to bring up the definition to the

383
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,687
Therapist didn't realize that he had brought the wrong version of the DSM

384
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
Which was an issue

385
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,063
So then he went to the APA website

386
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
To try and find the definition

387
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
In the DSM-5

388
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
However

389
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
He found vapa

390
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Summary definition

391
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
Of the DSM-5

392
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,911
I didn't so doing revealed that he had no idea what he was talking about

393
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
The therapist away

394
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
I don't think I know what you're

395
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
I don't think I know what you're showing me

396
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
And then he just

397
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Changed

398
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:05,759
I need the lawyer turned around 5

399
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,927
Two guys walking by holding a glass pane I was watching

400
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:19,327
I found it to be really uncomfortable because

401
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,935
That's going to play

402
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Traffic

403
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,495
It was really grim

404
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Funny like

405
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
No matter who you're watching it

406
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
The public performance

407
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Enso

408
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Your kind of

409
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Cringing

410
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
No matter

411
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Just taking out you know

412
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Where's

413
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Lawyers for

414
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Plaintiff

415
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
You're just taking all that out

416
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
The public performance

417
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
So whenever anyone

418
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Azure there's

419
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
Weird awkward thing that happens

420
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
You're just sore

421
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Seriously

422
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Binging

423
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
For them

424
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
The case at hand

425
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Oh my

426
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,687
Do you know how did that happen

427
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
It's pretty daring

428
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
Do the start of ad hoc

429
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,928
Open court

430
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
But but you were serious

431
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
I found my

432
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Thinking well

433
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Here's the therapist

434
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,632
And the DSM is something that therapist

435
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
Consult routinely

436
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
So if you thought that you were going to

437
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
You know these definitions and

438
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
The question

439
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Maybe just

440
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Go out

441
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Sudoku

442
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,968
Bookstore

443
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Darren is a fun word that using that

444
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,928
It seems like desperate

445
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
Tragically stupid

446
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,328
Foolhardy

447
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Y'all

448
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Use my Texas

449
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
You know I just

450
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
My little choirs

451
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
Kaiser tell you I have Googled a thesaurus

452
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,200
Exact letter words though

453
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
I know I just

454
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,344
Did not understand

455
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
Possibly understood that

456
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,304
I don't know understand that

457
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,656
Do you think anyone has ever even seen that before right like in real Court

458
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Yeah

459
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Yeah

460
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,080
Dome9 cases

461
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
You do you have

462
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
People

463
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
I'm really young

464
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
I'm really trying to

465
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Understand

466
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
Understand

467
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,192
The night moments for that lawyer I just

468
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
You'd hope

469
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
But I mean like

470
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Also I get the sense from

471
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,616
I don't know maybe just a Vibe I'm getting off of him

472
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
I don't think he beats himself up too much

473
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Pittsburgh

474
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Coming off poorly

475
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
That's just my sense

476
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,368
Texas monthly is apparently doing

477
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
A profile of

478
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Alex Jones

479
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
What's the square

480
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,744
Federico NG Marino

481
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
What happened

482
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
Huge interest his name is

483
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,912

Hi I'm sorry I'm just kidding

486
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
You know I think she's kind of

487
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Play

488
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
From what foods

489
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
As monthly reporter was telling me

490
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
Grnn

491
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
For the families

492
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,184
That he's kind of

493
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,792
Family name around here

494
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Emma sister

495
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
Us attorney was

496
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,960
Disappointed by Eric Holder I think

497
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
Jordan

498
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
The pain that when I was

499
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Tweeting that about his

500
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Mystery

501
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
A matter of

502
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
You know okay

503
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Sometimes it's

504
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Yo

505
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
This person will pay you

506
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
New or

507
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
What have you

508
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
There's some idea here that

509
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
You know that.

510
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,608
You know everybody deserves

511
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
More that than the payday

512
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Oh yeah

513
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:51,200
Yeah I'm sure I've seen his mentor sitting in court right next to him the entire

514
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,016
I'm sure is not about money

515
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Actuation

516
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
Yeah it's all about

517
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,184
All about everybody deserve their day in court right

518
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
Dakota wire

519
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
The career fuc

520
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,584
In case that's true this is the kind of thing that can really

521
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
But you know what I got to say like

522
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,496
Recognizing that aspect of his history that makes

523
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,080
Some of the stuff that's going on look way worse yeah

524
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,712
Because they're there have been repeated instances where he's shown Witnesses things that he hasn't

525
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Taken by

526
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
To the plaintiffs attorneys for football

527
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,648
Which they pointed out a couple times is like Year One

528
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
Yeah

529
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:38,816
Those aren't mistakes that someone of a caliber would make

530
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
Yeah at least not a mistake number for

531
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,800
Then I expect it's on purpose getting into a fight with Mark Banks

532
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,920
Giving him the bird in court like these are things that like

533
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Free that

534
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Observing that

535
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Camille

536
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Suddenly

537
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
He realized

538
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
This

539
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Is

540
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
Place I want to be

541
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
I don't want to be within a thousand miles

542
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
Where I am

543
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
China

544
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
Getting beaten up

545
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,336
Pure in this case

546
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,896
I'm really trying to

547
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
Keep it there

548
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,368
Salt Lake that moment in a wrestling match when someone's losing and they go for a chair

549
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,976
Disqualified

550
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Putting it then anything I can

551
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Map with right now

552
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,168
I have to go with my favorite adjectives for him at this current time which is eviscerate

553
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,264
He's literally had his guts ripped from his body

554
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,360
What day does this Soros

555
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
After you know the judge had

556
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:05,088
Admonished him and he was losing that exhibits

557
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,160
And he was feeling frustrated because

558
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:12,000
Who is maybe in his mind he genuinely

559
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,632
I don't know but it felt like a kind of like volcanic

560
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
Frustration that have

561
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Right there

562
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,984
You know

563
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,592
It if he's like this kind of well-bred guy that you know we're hearing

564
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:33,760
You would be a childish bully a well-read guy being a childish bully giving

565
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,808
People that finger whenever they embarrass him

566
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
That's crazy

567
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,184
What's the equivalent of picking up a chair in Smash

568
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,280
You know what I mean you know you can't do

569
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
It's wild

570
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,376
That was sad that

571
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,960
Whole confrontation happened

572
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
The parents of a murdered child

573
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Standing 10

574
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
10 ft away

575
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Damn

576
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,688
I think strategically when the judge wasn't in the room

577
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Yes

578
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
Judge Campbell was in there she said today that if she were available she would have held him in contempt of court

579
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Yeah

580
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Yeah she said had ice

581
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Christine had I been in the room

582
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
When that happened

583
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,752
Yeah so she was definitely so I kind of love is a defense for not doing anything is like

584
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:33,152
Well because I only saw accurate live video of it occurring I can't do anything

585
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,736
Didn't see the chair

586
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,040
Real wrestling

587
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:44,928
Turn this back and then they hit him with a chair

588
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
If I

589
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Turn around while I'm driving

590
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,048
This car and I see what you're doing to your brother

591
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
There will be problem

592
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,888
I know it's happening

593
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,984
But the minute I see it with my own eyes you kids are in trouble

594
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
Yeah it's your responsibility to do something once

595
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
You observed

596
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:09,504
Not yet not to ask you a question that might be uncomfortable

597
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,832
But exactly how many times have you felt

598
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,160
Like you and the judge are both moms

599
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
Really trying to handle unruly children

600
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
Same here

601
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Yeah

602
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
Yeah I mean I think about that

603
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:33,056
Alex Jones I mean just his behavior and their you do relatively rare occasions he

604
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
He turns up for

605
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Receding

606
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
It's like this

607
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,944
Kid who has stalled out

608
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
In Middle School

609
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
I mean

610
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Even

611
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
The whole idea that.

612
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:52,000
Traveling around surrounded by bodyguards I'm sort of thinking like a high school hallway

613
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,912
Bought lunch for the whole football team so that there's 10 other people

614
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:05,312
There's exactly 11 people with Alex it is literally the Star Quarterback being surrounded by the red

615
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
What's the team

616
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
Sublime

617
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,968
I'll pay for your lunch if you just

618
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,040
Follow me down the hall to my lock or so no one beats me hop

619
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:21,696
I need any big big muscle guys with guns to

620
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:26,816
Talk about one thing that did happen I've made reference to this on a previous episode but

621
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,168
Are you experienced that's why I want to get your take on it was from today

622
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,496
Last week when Alex was there

623
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:40,896
And was giving his a little 8 years doing at the press conference out in front of the

624
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
The courthouse so yeah

625
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
Bissell

626
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,296
This was a situation where there was no one but security guards

627
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
You

628
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Sebastian Murdoch

629
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
I believe

630
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
And it

631
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
What was going on there

632
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
From Hurst

633
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Okay

634
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,912
Is one other person baudin

635
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
Inaccurate

636
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,264
Yeah out of context

637
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,616
Anyways sorry I was I was observing this from

638
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
Safe distance

639
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
I have binoculars I was on the roof or the building across the street

640
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,768
No I was maybe

641
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
No

642
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Right

643
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
I was maybe twenty feet away

644
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
Serta just standing and

645
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Vaping

646
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
And giggling

647
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
A little bit because

648
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,848
The spectacle of it was was truly bizarre

649
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,200
My assessment was

650
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
He didn't know

651
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,088
He didn't know that you were you and that Sebastian was Sebastian

652
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
He just thought this was media

653
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
Which is

654
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Happy

655
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
Give me an idea of how many times you have met and spoken to Alex Jones via any different

656
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Luke was backed up

657
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
True true

658
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Yes

659
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:19,456
Well I've never recognize anybody who is wearing a mask before so I do understand now that it makes perfect

660
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
Blind

661
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,648
So yeah I mean I spent a lot of time with him

662
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
But it was in 2018

663
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,304
So I think it also I think in the heat

664
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Publicity moment

665
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
I think she just

666
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
She's as you say

667
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
No I think you just

668
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
People

669
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,056
Recording him as generic media

670
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
An audience

671
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Faceless audience

672
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
He was talking to

673
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
He did ask

674
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
John from hers

675
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
You know where are you from and

676
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
To talk to

677
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Oxygen because

678
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
He did ask

679
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
So what is it

680
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,912
Condition

681
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:16,032
Here

682
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,688
Hip Hop

683
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,016
John Cena really good journalist was like

684
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
This says that it's a

685
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
Important

686
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
He was like

687
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
Really you know what is it

688
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
No really what is it

689
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
What is a hernia

690
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,120
Okay

691
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
Here's an untreated hernia and that

692
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
That is

693
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
Medical condition

694
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Prevented him

695
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
From sitting through the

696
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
The trial

697
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
I don't even believe that

698
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah I was going to say that doesn't even sound reasonable to me

699
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,040
Say something like you know I got the

700
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,136
How to get removed

701
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Feel like my response to that is do you even lift bro like I feel like that's my

702
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
Okay I'm done

703
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Yelling probably

704
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
Are you sure if you're happy

705
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,848
If it was his like fifth or sixth about of covid that he's dealing with

706
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
Keep getting that

707
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
He was coughing

708
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
Keep

709
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
Smart

710
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Smart

711
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,904
How long did it take for him to realize that this was not unknown

712
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,928
Media to him

713
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
So

714
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Sub

715
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
From from HuffPost

716
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
Sub murdoc asked him

717
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:53,056
Cryptocurrency that you got is an anonymous donation because

718
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
We sold it was only worth

719
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
7

720
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:07,136
Directions by criticism

721
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
That is fair

722
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,720
Exactly so

723
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
People that does not equal bankrupt

724
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
And so he

725
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Persist

726
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
He said

727
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
I said something like

728
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
Didn't you just

729
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
$1000000

730
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Anyways like

731
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
And I said

732
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
So you're not exactly

733
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Broke

734
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
When I pee it means

735
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
That is a man

736
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
Who's got the goods

737
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,024
If you really wanted to insult me like

738
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,096
Why wouldn't you pick like a smaller

739
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
You know item

740
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,776
Brazil nut brain I was going to say it like why aren't you just followed me on Twitter and grabbing a couple from there

741
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,592
They're Universal I'm not like that personal

742
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:03,456
So you are pretty comes out

743
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,832
Recognition

744
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,624
Oh this is Batwoman

745
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,440
This is that woman from the New York Times

746
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
Is that he said

747
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,304
Oh no heat he did look over while he was talk

748
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
270 said

749
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,728
This is a trial of media these are these are fraught like that New York Times person right there

750
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
And then I asked about the million dollars and he

751
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
He said Walnut brain and then he went into

752
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Percentage of monster and

753
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Stir-fried

754
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:47,232
Here's the good news the only people he's saying these terrible things about you two is who's secure

755
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,816
There's no one else

756
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,120
And you know at least

757
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
If it's

758
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
Bodyguardz

759
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
Good to be

760
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
You know armed

761
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,224
It really it really did take awhile for me to remember whenever the bodyguards were sitting next to me it took me awhile

762
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
While Furby to remember like

763
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
They can't bring guns into the court

764
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
You realize that Jordan

765
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,904
That's not okay

766
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
And they're not going to like

767
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Pushy

768
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:25,376
And of course they've a license to push for money yes okay

769
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,776
Alright I was I was watching all of this I thought it was really fun because I could see a shift

770
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
All happening in the conversation

771
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
And then after the shift

772
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
Once became a little bit hostile

773
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,272
Alex put on the bumper sticker on his face

774
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:48,416
I took a picture with his lawyer and I've actually been really offended that some

775
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Outlets

776
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,048
Have a run with that picture on their story

777
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,960
It's such a it's a it's a Well framed picture I will give I will give the photographer that but it's

778
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,008
Like I was there when it was taken

779
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:08,384
This is Alex with a dumb bumper sticker on his mouth and he put on for show shaking hands with his lawyer

780
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,712
Wild no one watched yeah like it was

781
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
It's

782
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,576
I don't know it it kind of

783
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
Even before opening arguments began on the first day

784
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
He put it over his

785
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
Federico

786
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
Indeed

787
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,240
Can even laugh now

788
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:39,104
Dan's even laughing now when you say is real babe but it's longer

789
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
I just feel like it's important

790
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
The accurate

791
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,064
So yeah so he was sort of mugging for for him

792
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
And then he put

793
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
Didn't put it away I mean

794
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,976
Reynald gave him the side eye

795
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Don't do that the parents are

796
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,096
Sitting right there you know

797
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
The only person

798
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,032
That you're entertaining with this you're definitely

799
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
View of the parents

800
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:15,712
But this isn't that question can I ask you

801
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
Who is real quick

802
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Real quick

803
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
Do you are you surprised like

804
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,672
I really never thought I would be surprised

805
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:30,816
At what happened but for some reason I really thought when it actually came to being in the courtroom

806
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,400
There's no way they would behave like the like

807
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
They had to prepare they've had

808
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,032
So much time right now

809
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
Are you surprised

810
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
You do yes

811
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
So

812
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
One thing is that

813
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
First of all I get

814
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
From rain all his lawyer that

815
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,088
She feels like oh

816
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,624
I'm not sure what I got mice

817
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
I think that that

818
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
You know explosion with the you know

819
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
In the bird and all that

820
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
What is a sort of expression of that

821
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,632
Today what happened to him

822
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Boys another

823
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
I think he feels like

824
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
Oh my God I don't know what I got my

825
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
The idea that

826
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,616
Trying to kind of waffle about actually weather Jones

827
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
Fire not

828
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Torres

829
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
Yeah I just show like I'm so

830
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
Testify

831
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,624
And then he had to go check with them I think these are all sort of

832
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
Indications that

833
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,256
You know he should have known what he was getting him

834
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
Myself into but I don't

835
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
Incubus Philippe

836
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
Prepared for that

837
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
If I did

838
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
Not exactly a knock on him

839
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Because

840
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,264
Is anyone ever fully prepared for things that else

841
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,408
I'm going to have a disagreement with you there real quick I feel like

842
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
Any kind of preparation any kind of preparation even the slightest amount does not wind up with you

843
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,184
You having 10 minutes left to call your main witness as

844
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
Whether or not they will take

845
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Fair fair

846
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
Yeah that was today

847
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
Wake me up

848
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,752
The previous lawyers what should I do

849
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,800
Yeah oh yeah Oh you mean like

850
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,872
The 12 previous lawyers

851
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
You could have had her Focus

852
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,480
His previous players

853
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
Call Dave a Baker's Dozen basically

854
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
Yes it would have been like him

855
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
A crowd

856
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
Zoom

857
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
Previous lawyers where are you

858
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Could say

859
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
What advice

860
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Do you have for me

861
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:41,632
Can't do that with one of Alex's lawyers you're going to get it too but that's just going to happen

862
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
So he said

863
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
So he's I said will

864
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Is out

865
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
Going to testify and he said

866
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
It's all up to Alex

867
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
And I said

868
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Do you mean

869
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
All of it

870
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
The nearest like yep

871
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
It's all up to Alex

872
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,807
Bro

873
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
You know how that goes it seems like a lot of stuff in his life is that

874
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:12,351
Yeah but there's not a lot of great Council in many areas are

875
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,911
Anybody really telling him he cut it out

876
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,727
Just be so curious

877
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
No

878
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:26,687
Is really like to see go home and say well that went about how I expected or

879
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,759
Oh my God I can't believe I got myself into this

880
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
You know I

881
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,087
Ladder

882
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
If you talk about Alex he goes home and says hello whiskey my old friend

883
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,327
Yeah

884
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,703
You know I don't know but yeah no I agree I

885
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
There've been a lot of moments I think he's

886
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Actually you can tell that

887
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
She is

888
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Criminal process

889
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
Cuter by the way

890
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,967
He cross-examines the witnesses

891
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
He is pretty aggressive

892
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
He's he also just

893
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:08,927
Kind of rolls with it when the judge kind of slaps him down on the various things like we talked about

894
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Quick on his feet

895
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Coming back

896
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
Back from that kind of thing

897
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
But that's not to say

898
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
This is

899
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
Going well because

900
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
It's just

901
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
Even if no one said

902
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
Edward just the idea of

903
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
Alex Jones

904
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Anna Sandy Hook family

905
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Europe

906
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
How to say a word

907
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
To know that this

908
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,247
This is probably going to be a tough

909
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:42,719
You know did ironic thing is it hadn't occurred to me until I was watching him and then put it together

910
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,559
Said that he was a criminal defense lawyer and then started thinking about what

911
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Erno a criminal prosecutor

912
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,935
Answer to thinking about what they do and then I started thinking

913
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:57,311
96% of cases go to a plea bargain

914
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
In in that kind of

915
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,151
So this is probably guy

916
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,551
Who's really good at doing paperwork and like negotiating with other lawyers as to what's an acceptable

917
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,951
Sentence doesn't end up with a lot of trial going to an actual trial because he does

918
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
Does not have experience

919
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,303
I just can't believe that he does

920
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,375
Yeah I think some of the Warriors who have been

921
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
Have been watching this

922
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
Kind of weighing in

923
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Completely descent

924
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
Interested except for

925
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
For the fact that their lawyers and this is

926
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Fascinating

927
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Would disagree

928
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,919
Agree with you there

929
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
A lot of prostitute

930
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
Tutorial courtroom

931
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Experience

932
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:45,439
On the other side you know

933
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Some of these

934
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Injury

935
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,279
Chase's or

936
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
You know lawyers

937
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,583
Who are tort lawyers

938
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Impact

939
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,935
The father of Josh koskov who represents

940
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,983
The Sandy Hook families in Connecticut

941
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
His dad has

942
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,079
Passed away but I interviewed him for the book

943
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,383
And he said

944
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,199
One of the funniest things that has

945
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
People settle so

946
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Frequently

947
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
We get less

948
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
Some less time in the courtroom

949
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
What are the reason

950
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,207
Catnip for the legal community

951
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Is that you have

952
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Tucson

953
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
You actually have

954
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
Amount of courtroom

955
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
And so it's

956
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
It is kind of fast

957
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Fascinating to

958
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
Reynald

959
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,591
S*** the bed like a f****** idiot

960
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:40,223
Different ways of describing the same thing

961
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
But yeah I mean it is

962
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
The whole thing is

963
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,255
If it weren't so tragic I think it would be in a text

964
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Kind of way really

965
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,607
Rarely

966
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Rarely anybody drag their feet this long

967
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,239
Dishes at this far

968
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
Yes exact

969
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
Exactly and then that's

970
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,383
Determination to kind of roll back the clock

971
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
And say

972
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,991
This is a defamation trial no it's not you lost

973
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
You know because you

974
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
Because you had

975
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,623
Complete contempt for the judicial

976
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Are you lost

977
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
Your opportunity

978
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,719
To make the surf

979
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
Chase

980
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Because you didn't wind up at trial be

981
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Because you would not come

982
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Comply with

983
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,655
You know not any but most

984
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,935
Of the court orders

985
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
And most

986
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,495
You know what your

987
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
To prepare for that trial

988
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Sailed

989
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
And now here you are and it damages

990
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
And you're trying to

991
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
Turn it into a

992
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Signal test

993
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
Which I think

994
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,295
Most people would have been

995
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,159
That didn't happen because

996
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,231
He stonewalled his way into a damages

997
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
And so

998
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
He is where he is

999
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
And I think both he and his lawyer

1000
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
Wish they were in a different

1001
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
They're not

1002
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Yeah

1003
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,007
That's the thing that I find so frustrating

1004
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,079
A lot of the responses that I see from people who are not like

1005
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Necessarily paying

1006
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
That close of attention

1007
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
But the dealer

1008
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,831
Not recognizing that Alex absolutely would have gotten a trial on the merits

1009
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
If he just

1010
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,415
Cooperated in anyway

1011
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,535
Yeah like here that point be made and then people just not hear it

1012
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
Not listen not understand that like

1013
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
The only reason

1014
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
That this is happening is because of

1015
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,471
These choices

1016
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,103
I really almost want like every article written about it to begin with a

1017
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,431
Timeline of the number of times that Alex could have

1018
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,735
Just apologized and stopped

1019
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,295
With no lawsuit whatsoever

1020
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,391
Could have just made a public apology and stop

1021
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,791
With no lawsuits for whatsoever and then the number of times that once the lawsuit was brought they could

1022
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Could have done any

1023
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:09,471
Billion number things to keep it from getting to where we are now and instead everybody keeps writing

1024
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,287
Sing like the families are seeking damages

1025
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,223
12 template of how trials are expressed her or

1026
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,319
I have labored with that Justin writing my stories you notes

1027
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,111
Trying to say all the time that

1028
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
What they really want

1029
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Is

1030
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,791
You know they want that they are a mean this is the altruist

1031
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,655
Fixing here they really are trying to shine a light on the fact that

1032
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
The lies around Sandy Hook

1033
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,495
Yeah and here I'm like

1034
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
You're talkin about

1035
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
What I talk about it

1036
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
My book

1037
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
And that's that

1038
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
It really was

1039
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,943
Foundational story of how

1040
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Formation has

1041
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
Taken hold

1042
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
In art

1043
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Discourse

1044
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
You do because

1045
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
It just went from

1046
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,879
And Alex was at the

1047
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,439
The center of a lot of this you know it went from

1048
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
Pizzagate

1049
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
Qanon

1050
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
Coronavirus myths

1051
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
To the stop the Steal

1052
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,143
Campaign 2

1053
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
January

1054
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Directions

1055
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
And you know

1056
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,263
His fingerprints are on

1057
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,103
Pretty much all of those at all

1058
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,151
Throw Charlottesville into the mix too

1059
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,199
Absolutely

1060
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
So

1061
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,039
His fingerprints are all over those

1062
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Development

1063
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,087
And so in that

1064
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
This is

1065
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,671
It really is a kind of

1066
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
Fake news on trial

1067
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Pipes

1068
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
Really is

1069
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Yeah

1070
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,911
You know and I think that's one reason why people are so invested in it and

1071
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,215
Defense that that

1072
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
He's trying to put forward

1073
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
Really does

1074
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
Concern first

1075
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
First Amendment lawyers this idea that

1076
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
There's so much

1077
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Garbage

1078
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,479
In the atmosphere there are so many lies

1079
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
And Miss Truth

1080
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
International

1081
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
Discourse right now

1082
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,111
That who's to know

1083
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
True or false

1084
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
This seems like

1085
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,487
Such a specious cynical argument

1086
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
Actually

1087
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,327
The more of this stuff that is

1088
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:16,191
Floating out there the more lies are you are spread to millions of

1089
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
People the more

1090
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
People will advance

1091
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,287
First offense and you will see

1092
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
See it in these Dominion voting

1093
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,407
You'll see it in the January

1094
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
Insurrectionist

1095
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Cases

1096
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
You'll have p

1097
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
People who will say

1098
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,319
Like Alex Jones said in his deposition

1099
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
Kind of psychosis

1100
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,439
Because I was lied to so many times

1101
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,767
In an interview with Glenn Greenwald he just said he was drunk

1102
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,911
It's a kind of insanity defense

1103
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:54,591
It's the Jamiroquai defense

1104
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:59,455
I woke up the next morning and work 1/2

1105
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,855
I didn't put the pieces together I thought you were trying to polish

1106
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:12,255
Wasn't me because I got high

1107
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,911
One other thing I was just thinking about was

1108
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,727
If Alex does take the stand

1109
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
Tomorrow

1110
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,431
That is going to be wild for a number of reasons first of all because he will be in Ohio state of cross-examination

1111
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
But then the other aspect of it

1112
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
Is

1113
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,087
These questions that the jury has been giving

1114
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,415
Oh s*** it's been pretty good

1115
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Yeah

1116
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,655
It's because I do think that it's there's a lot of things that probably need clarification from the jury's point of view

1117
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,703
That maybe the lawyers aren't aware of

1118
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,079
That's really helpful but I think it would like based on the trend of the questions we've been seeing

1119
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,663
They could ask some really messed up things Alex

1120
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,223
Not messed up like

1121
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
Bizarre anything but like

1122
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,831
Pointed questions that he does not want to answer

1123
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,671
And then he appears to be evasive to the jury's on question

1124
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,511
Like he puts himself in a really really dangerous position there

1125
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,839
The best

1126
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,167
He would do that he would have made them I mean

1127
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,495
Bedford

1128
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:30,847
The worstest the contempt I mean like getting thrown out of court

1129
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Exploding

1130
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
Which is what

1131
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
Did in his car

1132
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
Anthony trial remember

1133
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,063
That was where you know it was like

1134
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,647
His ex-wife had attorneys who

1135
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,463
Really knew how to get under his skin

1136
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
And he finally just

1137
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,119
Bloated I I talked with Charlie warzel about that cuz he was in the courtroom

1138
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
And he was saying

1139
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,471
If it would have been a regular thing of bailiff would have

1140
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
Escorted him out

1141
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,055
Wow he's just he just

1142
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:07,455
Exploded and ballast for him because I'm sure Mark has no idea how to get under his skin

1143
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,855
Doesn't seem like a guy who knows how to get an Ender anybody skip from sitting in that deposition

1144
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,903
His numbers

1145
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:22,303
But good news is if a bailiff to get Alex out of the courtroom

1146
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,375
Standoff

1147
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,447
I don't know I mean

1148
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,519
I don't know it just

1149
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,567
Wouldn't rule out

1150
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
The facts

1151
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
Or the

1152
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Not the fact

1153
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
The possibility

1154
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,991
That rain all his lawyer is

1155
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
Working on him

1156
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Right now just to say

1157
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Alex

1158
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,903
Unless you're going to like

1159
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,695
Prostrate yourself

1160
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Before

1161
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,559
The court and end at abject

1162
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
Apologize

1163
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,631
There's probably not a lot

1164
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
You can say that's good

1165
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
Can I help you

1166
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,495
Yeah you you being you

1167
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,287
You know

1168
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:12,479
Begging him to know how many I mean you remember better than I do but

1169
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
How many times did Alex in a softball t-ball interview where his aunt is

1170
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Questions were answered

1171
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
For him

1172
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
How many times do they say

1173
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
I never lied on purpose

1174
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
888

1175
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,351
8 and 40 minutes

1176
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Yeah yeah

1177
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
And then he said he was drunk when he was saying these things about Sandy Hook families twice

1178
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
About the Greenwald say I thought you were talking about something

1179
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
Decided in advance that the election was going to be stolen

1180
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,343
Really messed up things just like

1181
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:56,255
No one asked him to do one like it wasn't doing being pushed on everything

1182
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,815
Becca Becca

1183
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,351
Of all people

1184
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
Do you know what confirmation by his his

1185
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
That was really

1186
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
Next episode Alex Jones like

1187
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,407
I decided before the election happens that it was stolen

1188
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,831
Confirmation bias is like the most

1189
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
Elementary

1190
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,975
Term for her I just I can't even imagine

1191
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,279
I'm sure that came off to her as late

1192
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Of what I do

1193
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,215
You know what my area of study is or

1194
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,799
Or are you just purposely trying to belittle me

1195
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
You know

1196
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
It probably was

1197
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
Was legitimately the ladder

1198
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,455
I mean

1199
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,295
I don't know I mean

1200
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:57,951
That was a wild red man with a lot of connections in a in a city General

1201
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
Really treat women really well

1202
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
That's what I've noticed

1203
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,071
Yeah

1204
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
He has to attack p

1205
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
People like that

1206
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
Because he cannot attack

1207
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
So

1208
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
You notice

1209
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
You know

1210
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,639
Impeach her or belittle her or make her seem

1211
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Like she does

1212
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
Have the gravitas

1213
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
She has

1214
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,759
I think is just

1215
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
At some level

1216
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
Because

1217
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,927
He really cannot lay a finger on

1218
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
Niall and Scarlett

1219
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
It just

1220
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,535
Too awful

1221
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
They are

1222
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:41,471
It's weird because I think on some level the the attempted impeaching the

1223
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,263
Psychiatrist and therapist

1224
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
I don't

1225
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
Thank a tits

1226
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,127
Really easy to see that

1227
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,687
If you're the jury and not see that as

1228
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,735
Being an attack on the

1229
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:59,135
The airlift experience.com Scarlett tell you their therapy

1230
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:04,255
Best bet they are lying to you the things that they have told

1231
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,839
The therapist right

1232
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:14,239
You know that because they were not I think what he was relying on is that they were beat that they would be much

1233
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,311
Older and more clinicals and they actually were

1234
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,591
Yeah I think that's right

1235
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
Especially the therapist

1236
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,687
I mean that was you know I mean he was

1237
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,479
Mr. Crouch was

1238
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
Literally

1239
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
Starting to cry and he you know he was

1240
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,391
Obviously very much feeling their pain

1241
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
And soda

1242
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,743
Come after him as if he would have been this sort of like

1243
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,279
Great clinician

1244
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,423
That's just not who I have seen in my patients many different desires they have

1245
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,007
If you would have been someone like that

1246
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,823
A great strategy

1247
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,359
Because

1248
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
The man himself was so sympathetic

1249
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
And because he had

1250
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,759
You know you was just sort of integral

1251
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,527
What part of

1252
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
The community

1253
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
Around Newtown

1254
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,111
And he had worked

1255
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
With First Responders and he was

1256
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
He had very much

1257
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,255
The tragedy and the aftermath

1258
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
He was not

1259
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,839
The kind of basic you know

1260
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
Hired Gun

1261
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Start at all

1262
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:21,567
That was one of the big things that backfired on the defense lawyer was when he was trying to Almost Say

1263
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
Hey like

1264
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:25,151
Because you're part of the community

1265
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:30,783
You are so biased in their favor you could never be an impartial Witness

1266
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,575
And instead of like

1267
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:37,695
Saying instead of successfully getting the jury to be like this guy's biased

1268
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
The jury was like

1269
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,303
Yeah fukin right man

1270
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
God

1271
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,911
Yeah no yeah I mean

1272
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,495
It would be impossible I think to be

1273
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,775
Well not impossible

1274
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,079
But I was going to say

1275
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Nearly

1276
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Impossible

1277
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,991
To be in that Community when

1278
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
Those events happened

1279
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
And not

1280
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
Heal an abscess

1281
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,111
For everyone

1282
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
I mean it just

1283
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
That's kind of party

1284
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
Being Human

1285
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
Being right

1286
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
So

1287
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,535
Again that was

1288
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
I don't know I

1289
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,631
I'm sort of

1290
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
Shaking my head cuz I don't

1291
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Really

1292
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
I mean I can

1293
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
First and I think he prepared

1294
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,055
Four different person

1295
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
I think I think you're right

1296
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,479
But also I would suggest that if some tragedy befell Austin

1297
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,527
Alex would not

1298
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Feel

1299
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
Does Superbad agree with Dad on this part of a community

1300
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,719
Sentara Leigh make one

1301
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,047
Doesn't

1302
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Empathy

1303
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:51,167
I don't think Alex would be in the position he's in

1304
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
Yeah it's probably true

1305
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,311
Well we should probably

1306
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,103
Before too long

1307
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:05,503
But I wanted to just say I guess and I'm sure you're on the same

1308
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
Same page

1309
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:10,111
With this tree has some thoughts on the matter of

1310
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:15,487
Making sure that this all stays squarely focused

1311
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,327
On what this is actually about as opposed to

1312
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:25,471
You know special 100% specially as we go into tomorrow where in theory Alex is going to be there in

1313
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,615
Who knows what could happen circus if the clown show we're all in there that there is no danger of that

1314
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,455
I I know that you're someone who deeply appreciates what

1315
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,831
Niall and Scarlett have gone through as well as

1316
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,135
We know many other parents and

1317
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,183
Community and family members

1318
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,303
What are your thoughts about that new if you have any

1319
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,607
Anything you want to say on that

1320
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,959
I mean that is there was

1321
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,543
Sort of like you know

1322
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
In the courtroom when

1323
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
Became apparent that

1324
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
You know

1325
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Quite likely

1326
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,479
Jones will testify although I

1327
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
I still

1328
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,111
But I think the whole thing of

1329
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:19,487
It is super unfortunate when it comes to the families because

1330
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,839
It's going to be super traumatic for them to

1331
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,399
Sort of share that day and share that

1332
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
You know

1333
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
The the sort of

1334
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
The same space

1335
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,543
Space with him

1336
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,663
I'm sure they'll do everything they can to to insulate them from

1337
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,943
Bob in the same

1338
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
In place while he's

1339
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
Testifying or what have you

1340
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,295
But I couldn't agree with you

1341
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
Seymour

1342
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
The sort of

1343
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
Proceeding that is

1344
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,487
Udo has lots of aspects

1345
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
Stericycle the legal part

1346
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,071
Intellectual part of it the

1347
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,887
A sort of you no competition of it

1348
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:01,215
And all of that and I think in in covering that and in

1349
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,543
And thinking about it and being part of it and being immersed in it

1350
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
It's

1351
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
Easy to forget

1352
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,615
That this

1353
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,895
About

1354
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
The parents

1355
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,271
Of a child who is murdered in Cold Blood

1356
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,319
After saving the lives

1357
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Nine of his classmates

1358
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
End

1359
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,927
Then his parents

1360
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,255
You know as we sat at the top you know what having

1361
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
Dot-dot

1362
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,583
Story to cling to and having

1363
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,631
Just this

1364
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
You know

1365
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,935
Thousands of people

1366
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Share that narrative

1367
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,007
For them by

1368
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,543
Saying it didn't happen

1369
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,359
You can intellectually know how

1370
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
Nuts

1371
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:45,759
But at the same time and and how and how ridiculous

1372
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,319
And how it how it should be a non-factor

1373
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Right

1374
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
But it is as though

1375
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,391
Psychologist

1376
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
Testified today it is

1377
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,743
You know no-one like

1378
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:56,767
Steel

1379
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,327
Miss apprehended even on a minor

1380
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
And to have somebody

1381
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
Take that

1382
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
That

1383
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
Precious

1384
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,263
You know narrative ends and you know everything

1385
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
That you're

1386
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,335
Child was away from you

1387
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
I mean that's

1388
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
That's really what this is

1389
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Is about

1390
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:17,247
And it's also about the broader thing and that's that the families are doing this

1391
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,063
Not because they even expect

1392
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
Any kind of

1393
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,439
Yeah monetary recompense from this

1394
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,743
Really as and I know this

1395
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Talking with them

1396
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
4 years

1397
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
For my book

1398
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,167
They're trying to send a message they really are trying to

1399
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Say

1400
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
Is this

1401
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
Can happen to us

1402
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
This could happen to your

1403
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,359
Community shooting although God knows that

1404
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,431
But this idea that Miss

1405
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,759
Information and disinformation and the scrambling of

1406
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,807
You know everything that we hold

1407
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
It comes to

1408
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
Establishing truth

1409
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,415
And relying on facts

1410
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:01,279
Could come for you in your community it could happen to your family

1411
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,327
And that's really the

1412
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Like

1413
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
Blaring

1414
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Red

1415
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,447
Signal that they are trying to send

1416
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
People

1417
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,239
This is

1418
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
A problem

1419
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,383
If you didn't notice it around us maybe you noticed it around January 6th

1420
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,943
Maybe you saw it around Coronavirus

1421
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
These are all the

1422
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,783
Same phenomena is and they're really trying

1423
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
To raise awareness

1424
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,855
And we should be thanking

1425
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
Because

1426
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,183
Of all the people who should be

1427
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,719
Be spared having to

1428
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
You know habit

1429
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,023
An additional burden of

1430
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
Standing Force

1431
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,607
Thing in America it should be discreet

1432
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Families

1433
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
And here they are

1434
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,423
Dinos

1435
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
This is

1436
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,543
You know pay attention

1437
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,359
Thank them for that

1438
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:51,455
Definitely mbb just your mentioning

1439
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,479
Like the

1440
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,295
Re-traumatizing of being in the room when Alex

1441
01:04:55,551 --> 01:05:01,695
May or may not testify absolute I couldn't even believe the Poise of them being there when Alex

1442
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,719
It was just sitting

1443
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:08,351
Yeah

1444
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,631
Yeah yeah

1445
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
You know

1446
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
Be in the presence

1447
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
Someone who has

1448
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
Abused

1449
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,359
You or

1450
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,919
You do or that you

1451
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,223
Thought within the past or that

1452
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
Yo a person who

1453
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,295
Stromedy

1454
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
Right

1455
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,927
It kind of shaky and nervous

1456
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,207
And you know

1457
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
It's really

1458
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:40,095
Scary and I I actually do think you know I hearing

1459
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
The two

1460
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,215
The psychiatrist in the end there

1461
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,007
Their therapist say that today

1462
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
They're scared

1463
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
I believe that

1464
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,871
Yeah absolutely

1465
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,895
It's it's

1466
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
It's

1467
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Because it's

1468
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:59,295
Heaped on top of what happened to them everything that they

1469
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,575
You everything was

1470
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,879
Torn out from under them they lost all sense

1471
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,415
Control and now

1472
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,231
Their child they lost

1473
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:07,999
You know

1474
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,303
Your whole world is thrown off

1475
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Access

1476
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
And now you know

1477
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,911
Control even over

1478
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,471
Story of how he died and

1479
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,287
And his heroism in his last moments

1480
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
I mean that's

1481
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,591
Understandable

1482
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,687
Yeah and to even add on to that you have the added

1483
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Sort of

1484
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:33,599
I don't know the unfortunate thing on top of it that it is it Alex's now

1485
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:38,207
Trying to control The Narrative of their involvement in this suit

1486
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Yep you know lexulous

1487
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:46,143
There's even almost a metaphysics going on him

1488
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
What

1489
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:54,079
Turn out ironically whatever Mark was like

1490
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
Okay

1491
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:59,199
If you say that they're adding to their own pain

1492
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,503
Guess who's at fault for that

1493
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:07,903
It's you you just added that we are now included in the charge

1494
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,975
What is funny Park

1495
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,559
Mark there's no more Mark moment than being like

1496
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
Find man

1497
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,983
See if I'm pulling out of steel chair

1498
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
Billion middle fingers after that one

1499
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,567
Well it's it's amazing cuz

1500
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,359
You would think like okay

1501
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
The Lost

1502
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,991
That's additionally traumatizing actually not it would have

1503
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
This happened is this

1504
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,319
4 years

1505
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
Stonewalling and

1506
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,391
Infighting and

1507
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,415
Tooth & Nail

1508
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
On the park

1509
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
Alex

1510
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
So

1511
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
That's the

1512
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
The traumatic thing is

1513
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,863
The four years of

1514
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
Trying to drag this out

1515
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,679
Trying to use

1516
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,471
In the book you know

1517
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
All of that

1518
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
Does he have a right to

1519
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Venom cell

1520
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Siri does

1521
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:02,431
That's not exactly

1522
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,223
You do that

1523
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
It wasn't

1524
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,807
A fair fight

1525
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
From the beginning so that

1526
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
Turn around app

1527
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
After four years of

1528
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
Extending this

1529
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
And then

1530
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,047
Well you know I'll be healed if you didn't sue me

1531
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,327
Is sort of the Hide

1532
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
Cynicism

1533
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,423
Yep and we would be

1534
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:28,287
Foolish to expect anything better I don't know if there's a better way to end it

1535
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,567
That's perfect

1536
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:35,967

The trial will stay in the

1541
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:55,935

1542
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,703
