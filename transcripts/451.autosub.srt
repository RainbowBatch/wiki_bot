1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan X swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,584
Just a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
What up

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,240
You go first

9
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,056
Is I9 has finally followed me on Twitter

10
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Twitter great rapper items

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
Congratulation

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
When we went to see the show with Evan far out

13
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
He and I talked about

14
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,304
Servant

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
And he decided that he would not follow me on Twitter until you'd seen Avatar

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,264
Sure

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
Do you on the following congratulations to I-90

18
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
Couch

19
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,536
Jordan

20
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,144
The mailbox

21
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,240
So

22
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
There's nothing on the table here.

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
I drank it

24
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:29,248
This was from Michigan

25
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
Okay girl has a little brain called No Miano am I

26
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
Particularly in a funk yesterday and I needed

27
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,536
Something

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
Right tackle

29
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,944
Seltzer's

30
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
Top of the mountain peaks

31
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
Everything was really good

32
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,560
68 and 75 out of 100

33
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,400
Secular that was at 75

34
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,312
You do flavors

35
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,944
Michigan cherry lime

36
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
But they were all fine outside

37
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
When is a cherry

38
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
Right

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
Figured out what the difference is bday

40
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
It did brighten my day

41
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
I was thrilled to get to the end of the evening and realize I just drank

42
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,712
What's the weather on the subject I want to say something really quick

43
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,576
Leaving point now where I'm starting to realize there's certain things that I've learned

44
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Okay

45
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Is carbonated water

46
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
Exactly how to say

47
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
What I want to say

48
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Strawberry

49
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Is pretty much always good

50
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
He's like weird Brands off brands at the dollar store

51
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Strawberry seltzer

52
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
Probably going to be

53
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Okay

54
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Talk to f****** a strawberry

55
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Yes sir

56
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
There are other flavors that are not

57
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Cucumber

58
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,063
Cucumber you don't like you I don't trust you

59
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,999
Grocery store brand I don't trust you to f*** around with you cover

60
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Yeah

61
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
It's not

62
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,375
Such a broad

63
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
Cucumber something is going to be okay

64
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Yours

65
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,543
Good and gather Target brand

66
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
Don't cry

67
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
You're putting on airs

68
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
And you shouldn't

69
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,039
These ones that are safe like a strawberry

70
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:16,415
Cranberry is almost impossible to f******

71
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Flower

72
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
Stick to the shallow water raspberry is fine to Bethel University good

73
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Basic Berry flavors

74
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
You can handle

75
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
Leave it to the pros

76
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,903
You're finding a lot of ways to say exactly what I'm trying to get to me

77
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Appreciate

78
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
Synthesized did quite well

79
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
So Jordans

80
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
Episode to go over gone over

81
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
20

82
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Troubling

83
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,615
Episode

84
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Oh boy

85
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,015
Coming back

86
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
His triumphant return

87
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,487
Like Napoleon returning from Elba

88
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,839
Show

89
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,751
I'm a policy wonk exam

90
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Juvenile policy walk

91
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
I try

92
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
Crystal

93
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
Initials

94
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Jake

95
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Thank you so much

96
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,791
Just I was trying to

97
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Maybe

98
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,911
Next

99
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Democrat

100
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
We got to go

101
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
What's the business

102
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Heroin

103
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Yes thank you very much

104
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,959
If you're up there listening

105
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Generosity and redirect

106
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
That would also be wonderful

107
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Appreciate

108
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Here's another complex dropped

109
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
From how this episode sort of wine

110
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,239
Signs of the end

111
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,639
This has been one of the most powerful broadcast we've ever did absolutely jam packed

112
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
Empathetic

113
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Let's go

114
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
I love it

115
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
The best job possible and I feel like an empty

116
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
Fraud of accomplishment you received whenever you're

117
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Add makes you feel pathetic

118
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,519
So we start here on the 29th and the Alex

119
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
To talk and if this doesn't sound good

120
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
If I were just like looking at this

121
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,271
Organization from like

122
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
If I heard him say this I would probably think like

123
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
It doesn't bode well

124
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Infowars.com

125
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Newswars.com

126
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Summit. News

127
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,031
Infowars

128
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
A frappe

129
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
Doesn't look like there's a c

130
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Ship the rats are trying to run away from

131
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
Paul is an interesting case

132
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,863
It's because he has his own sort of unique fanbase and he still other places

133
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Disseminate his videos and

134
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Uno's kids

135
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,775
It seems to be drawn to his whiny face in the Quick Cuts

136
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
But like

137
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,575
David Knight and Owen Shroyer are less popular than Infowars

138
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
You can make an argument is bigger than infowar

139
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
So is he

140
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Having his own thing

141
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Kind of makes sense

142
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,815
David Knight

143
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
Return by creating their own property

144
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
Or their own entities

145
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
That seems like a bad plan

146
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,799
Did it go well

147
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
I feel like you can just figure out from the number of

148
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Views on bam. f****** video

149
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
Alright no you just look at the difference in

150
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
BO2

151
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,655
I got my own site now I'm not with him

152
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Destroying

153
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
Talking about how you know this is going to

154
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
To be a civil war going on right

155
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Cold

156
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
This might as well be

157
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
The slowest of slow cooker

158
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
I'm pretty sure for some kind of a

159
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
Cold War

160
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
The moves I believe we should make

161
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Stop it

162
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
But

163
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,663
Let me just first tell you that is Rodger stone is breaking his silence

164
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
He's got a few interviews

165
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Exclusively

166
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
After

167
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Big events

168
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
But he's decided to just go ahead and

169
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
Silence

170
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Tomorrow

171
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Let me to decode that

172
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
Rodger expect

173
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Could be pardoned by now

174
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Before apart

175
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
What's happening

176
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,135
There's really not much more substance to it than that

177
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
Please don't totally

178
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Rogers

179
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,887
Almost his entire appearance is just like campaigning for Trump

180
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
It's selling himself as like if I don't have to go to prison

181
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
I will be one of the most powerful

182
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:40,575
It's exactly what you should do your Rodger Mako media tour

183
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
Much you can help Trump

184
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,327
Make it seem like people will take you seriously again

185
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
So there's two things

186
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
Most of the show about

187
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
29th Street

188
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
Night show any story

189
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Okay

190
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
The best way to do this

191
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Track number to headlines

192
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
We were facing an angry mob.

193
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Tell their side of the story

194
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Zerohedge

195
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647
Can you believe that these people have to

196
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,463
Tell their side of the story black lives matter

197
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
Go into their private estate

198
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Open the gate

199
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Private estate

200
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
An inside

201
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
Then they said after the people said get off her

202
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Whitelivesmatter says that's it we've

203
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
The money shot

204
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,575
Baeza protesters in St Louis

205
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,879
What street that is fair enough

206
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Emplaced

207
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,743
But the only did that because the other streets to the mayor's residence had been blocked off

208
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
And the point

209
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
I'm straight at the mayor's house

210
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
Speakers

211
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
Read the names and addresses of people calling for police reform during a Friday afternoon Facebook live video

212
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
The mare was essentially dachshund

213
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,687
Protest outside her home

214
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,527
As we walked past this deranged couples house they came out

215
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
Pretend they needed to protect their home

216
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
It's all going well for them to have guns on their property and to stand there at the protest goes by then they're right

217
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
If there's a

218
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Fine

219
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
Finger on the trigger and was pointing at people

220
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
That's not cool at all

221
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Responsible gun ownership

222
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,967
You should know that there's a massive difference between holding a gun safely and waving it around like an a******

223
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,879
Open carrying at a rally that Owen tried to go to

224
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Attempted murder basically

225
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
In this case however the gun is being pointed at people Alex wants

226
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Gun pointed at

227
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
Sports the person holding the

228
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
That's simple

229
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Game is very stupid

230
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
He spends a lot of time on the story

231
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,335
So we talked about it a little bit more and

232
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
What about this

233
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Couple

234
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Regardless

235
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
This is summer

236
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Lawyer

237
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Mansion

238
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,303
Boston to your house there's a big mob of 500 people what it was

239
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
You better

240
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
Come out with your house robbed

241
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,543
So you can hear hear this like people calling him a hero

242
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
Fruits that they're not Heroes

243
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Is at their Democrat

244
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
Alright

245
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
The names are Mark and Patricia McCloskey

246
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,863
Because they were homeowners association

247
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,495
This was about allowing same-sex couples who couldn't get married at the time to live in the neighborhood

248
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,383
Since previously they would have had to be considered roommates which wasn't permitted by the homeowners association

249
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:21,247
So they were fighting to uphold the anti cohabitation

250
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,343
Trying to restrict the neighborhood from having same-sex couples

251
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
To also be a big actually Democrat

252
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,655
It's not clear from what I was able to find what political party are registered to

253
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Federal election

254
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
Commission records

255
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,127
Contributed thousands of dollars to the Trump make America great again

256
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
The Republican National Committee

257
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
8819 96

258
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
2018

259
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,423
Sounds like a classic Democrat to me

260
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Alex talked about it

261
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
So much

262
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Call Derek

263
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Take the bow

264
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Story that Alex talked about

265
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Almost the entire episode

266
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,759
How to write down on notes

267
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
In my in my

268
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,135
He won't stop talking about

269
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
It seems really weird to me because

270
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,023
This is one that I

271
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Sacha Baron Cohen who says

272
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
The Free Speech arrest Alex Jones

273
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
A monstrous individual

274
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,823
Reopen America

275
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Event

276
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
And he says

277
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
I'm a country singer

278
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
All I can pay for

279
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
He gets very short saying racist stuff they run up and try to stop it

280
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Men

281
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
Stop them

282
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Mohican frame

283
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,751
Free

284
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
Sacha Baron Cohen so funny

285
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
He's a false

286
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
Swaggin slimy Criminal

287
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,111
That was supposed to be really didn't see any people

288
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
Singing

289
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,791
6 minute video that I watched nokat Senator anything

290
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,119
Lot of people singing along

291
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
For liking shopping up

292
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
Journalist

293
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:56,127
Injecting bauchi and Hillary with the number times any one of those people

294
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:02,015
Scuse me any want just one

295
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Any reason why

296
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
I mean like it's the same thing with a lotto Sacha Baron Cohen

297
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
Feel something

298
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
With

299
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,327
By the acceptance of

300
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
Doing something that's like oh wow that's awesome

301
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
Permission

302
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
To let this show

303
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
At a place like a three percenter rally

304
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:31,455
LOL I'll let you just ignore this honestly

305
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Every time

306
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
They get caught my hopes

307
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Tuesday should just be like

308
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
Everybody

309
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Manages to ignore

310
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
You would think

311
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
It would just be another

312
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
Goddamn much like half the episode

313
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,263
Can't get foreign liberals over here revealing that my friends

314
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
It's wild

315
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
So I'm only going to play

316
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Because of what happens on the 3rd

317
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,247
Talking about how

318
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Or at least I'm sorry

319
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
Half of

320
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
Telling you folks

321
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Pedophilia is just

322
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,863
The top half of the body hold onto that for later on the 30th

323
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
Has a little bit of a break.

324
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,239
Half pedophilia

325
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
But I'd like to think that it happened

326
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
You know it's real optimist

327
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Sure

328
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
Pretty racist

329
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,807
Search rambling around about Colin Kaepernick a little bit

330
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Straight straight

331
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
I don't know what

332
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Are you doing here man

333
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,719
I just I don't know what the point

334
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Kezar monster

335
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
He's nothing but a

336
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,311
Black shield

337
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
You represent black people now

338
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
You do not understand hair

339
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,984
Is that

340
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
What is

341
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
What are you doing

342
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:39,200
Nike told Colin Kaepernick to wear his hair in a certain way

343
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Can you call me

344
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Alex do you know anything

345
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,904
About Colin Kaepernick

346
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Family of origin

347
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Do you know anything about that

348
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Now you.

349
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Just talkin

350
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
It's wild to me when

351
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,216
Bigger trees and biases are more compelling to a person than curiosity

352
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Scream about something

353
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,616
That you could easily check into and you just don't

354
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,688
Oh man how are real

355
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
I guess

356
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Like

357
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
You could learn about Colin Kaepernick

358
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm not positive easy to

359
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
Look into whether or not Niketown

360
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,280
Come to where is Harrah certain way

361
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,584
Difficult to email

362
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,680
Is there a foil ball

363
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Alex

364
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
About haven't yelled about Colin Kaepernick

365
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,872
The way that I'm comfortable describing the braces

366
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Starts

367
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
What that Constitution

368
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
Everybody model their government after that

369
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Because the idea

370
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Are you a globalist

371
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,800
Globalist

372
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
And everybody knows it

373
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
And that's why they use a bunch of dumb

374
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
College dropouts at morons

375
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Running around

376
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
Can people

377
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
Try to trigger a civil war

378
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Video

379
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,536
I've some old folks in golf carts being screamed at my other old white people

380
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,120
You're a Nazi F you all the stuff

381
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,336
Ask yourself

382
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,344
Wow

383
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
I just

384
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:03,072
Kaepernick

385
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,472
That mentality this is clearly a joke

386
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:16,640
They say black power we should be allowed to say white power

387
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
If you ask the question

388
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Why can't I say white power

389
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
You're too far gone

390
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
Nothing very easier

391
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
So

392
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
That mean it's not

393
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,792
It's just a clear demonstration of where rice at Target

394
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
29th

395
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
Sacha Baron Cohen

396
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:48,128
Leads to Alex

397
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,368
That's not that's not the right angle

398
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,048
These are children's criminal fraud

399
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,168
Sacha Baron Cohen was taken away in an ambulance

400
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,288
And therefore this is also fraud claim medical condition

401
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,688
Sure I don't care

402
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,552
Along with its 3% or guy

403
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Really

404
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Gross

405
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
Communist

406
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
So there's a Stewart Road stalking about the protests are going on

407
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
Germany

408
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,080
China

409
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
Eventually

410
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,792
This is absolutely unacceptable

411
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,352
Someone has much of an extremist store roads

412
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,008
Also is Stewart's Line in the Sand of the act of killing police that he should

413
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,336
Damon gutzwiller of the Santa Cruz Sheriff's

414
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Department was ambushed

415
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
Person killed by staff sergeant Steven Carrillo

416
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
Who proceeded to write the words book

417
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
And I became unreasonable

418
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
In his own blood

419
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Before being arrest

420
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,000
These are words that have a particular meaning among far-right done absolutist communities and kind of give an indication of what

421
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
He was all about

422
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
A carrillo's arrestee was also charged with the murder of Patrick Underwood who was that law enforcement officer who was killed

423
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
On May 29th

424
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,824
And even more recently there was a case of Ethan melzer

425
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Who was charged with

426
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
Conspiring and attempting to murder us Nationals

427
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,736
Conspiring and attempting to murder military service members

428
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
Providing and attempting to provide material support

429
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
Terrorist

430
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Conspiring to murder and metaphor in country

431
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Missouri

432
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,536
Sensitive information including locations in security

433
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
Which is a European Neo-Nazi and white

434
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Supremacist

435
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,496
The plaintiff this information to Isis type to carry out the attack

436
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,336
Mauser didn't care if he died in the attack Saint who gives a f***

437
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
It would be another War

438
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
I would have died

439
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,456
Successful because another 10-year war in the Middle East

440
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
Definitely left a mark

441
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
Seems like babies George be spending less time fantasizing about how the left is eventually going to start killing cops and realize that he's alive

442
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,512
That sort of thing and worse

443
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,912
And cops represent tyranny but only when they're fighting them

444
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,008
Cool

445
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
It's just it's just

446
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Infuriating

447
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
There's just no way

448
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
Maximum

449
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
So we can

450
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Sacha Baron Cohen complaining

451
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
It's

452
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
The stuff where my eyes roll back in my head

453
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
Whiny whiny

454
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,120
I think one of the problems is because like

455
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
When

456
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,448
They have their equivalent of that

457
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
It doesn't really

458
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,800
Play out

459
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
Jacob Wohl does the Estancia

460
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Alex Warren

461
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
James O'Keefe

462
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
Alright whatever I don't care

463
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,024
Comedy that like overwhelmed

464
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
He's a joke

465
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,680
How many times have you seen that

466
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
At an open-mic who's like

467
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Obviously I'm

468
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
People aren't laughing

469
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,712
So if you don't like this incredibly dumb stupid

470
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
Transparent bulshit

471
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Oh well

472
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Cuz you're

473
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Must be

474
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,464
So we get to the 30th and Alex is very excited

475
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,048
Background Rodger Stone

476
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
Presidential election

477
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
Richard Nixon and he's a guy that got

478
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Donald Trump to run for office

479
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,200
Breaking his silence right now

480
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
Edmond

481
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Ahmed

482
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,296
Tuesday edition ears

483
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
Rodger Stone facing

484
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Execution base

485
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,208
Covid-19

486
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,256
Supposedly in 2 weeks

487
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,072
Hold on Rodger Stone

488
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
Because of covid-19 but covid-19 is a hoax

489
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,288
So no one really gets here

490
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,920
Play the Rodger and you don't want him to go to prison it's also a fraud and a hoax

491
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
When people ask you to where I'm at

492
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Okay

493
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
Exactly calm down

494
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,160
For sure

495
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,280
They're very serious concerns that need to be taken into account with prison population as it relate

496
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
To covid-19

497
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
That being said

498
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,496
Place that Rogers being sentenced to has no cases of covid-19

499
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
Tennis court exact

500
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Busy campus close those

501
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,832
Sure did a review

502
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
His health concerns are all under control and in check

503
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,720
And there is not a danger to his help

504
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
Particularly

505
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
To be put in prison

506
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,120
So anyway like I said this interview

507
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Begging

508
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Trump to

509
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
To give him a partial power

510
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,288
Until weather clemency

511
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,640
What made you change last few days and I'll be here you go

512
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,688
2020election your warning

513
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,248
I'm coming up

514
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
What made you say

515
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
The gloves are off

516
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
Questions

517
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
You want to ask me everything.

518
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,464
Because I'm concerned about the direction of this country

519
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,144
I see the way they have destroyed

520
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:39,776
I see the way our streets are under a violent socialist Revolution

521
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
And therefore the sooner I could speak

522
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,992
Incarcerated

523
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,088
In October of 2020

524
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
That's why I decided to speak out today

525
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,696
You told me that incompetent

526
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,280
Now you're just

527
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:08,192
Play he has respect

528
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
There's no other that he would have

529
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
What if he can't come out and Beyond

530
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
You can

531
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,528
You know I just I need to before I go to prison in 2 weeks

532
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
I need to get out here and Taylor

533
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,904
Going to kill me that I'm not able to be on the front line fighting for Trump

534
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
That makes me mad about having to go to jail

535
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Brilliant

536
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,864
That's it's pretty simple.

537
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
That's good

538
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,776
It said it's just sad because

539
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
It seems

540
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
Like at this

541
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Wait we all have enough knowledge

542
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
Trump psychology

543
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
To know that

544
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
What's going on is he

545
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
He's basically

546
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,576
Forcing Rodger to gravel in front of him so he

547
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,904
He can get feels like last second

548
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,744
And he pardons have been it's like hahaha see you look at how powerful I

549
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,584
He's just he's just making friends

550
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
Awful awful Tony subordinate

551
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
Two because Rogers going around on like these weirdo

552
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,664
Range internet shows

553
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,248
I know I just got to be out there on the front line fighting for the re-election

554
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,832
Trump pardoning him

555
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,928
Seems like a fulfillment of all of these these interviews

556
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,256
It makes all of his shows that he went on team power

557
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
Right yeah

558
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
There is

559
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
I mean

560
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984
Somehow I feel like Rodger Stone

561
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Even if he doesn't

562
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Get pardoned is going to wrap up his

563
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,872
Like he's going to find a a doppelganger

564
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
And like put his hat on there

565
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
Tattoo Nixon on his back and be like save that mate

566
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Get out of

567
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
Are you home

568
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,440
Find someone

569
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
I don't know

570
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,560
So this is just awesome

571
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
The goods

572
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
There's a point where Alex realizes like

573
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
You're not doing this Gooden

574
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,896
I was one of the first people

575
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
And the independence

576
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,720
And the anti-glare Lewis worldview

577
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Truly

578
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:59,200
Don't forget he's a piece of s***

579
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,344
Talking about how great a looks looks great

580
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
Why you sex but they're just

581
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Get the way

582
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,768
Body is at the wrong angle

583
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
It's so powerful

584
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Look at his

585
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,376
Casting face

586
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
So amazing

587
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
Such a

588
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,752
You know what it is it's instinct

589
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,056
Call Alex's Tire

590
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,480
Rogers giving this long list of smart

591
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:37,344
He's capable powerful he's independent

592
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,232
Greats don't forget you want to slobber all over his come on now buddy

593
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Very strange

594
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,680
The tiny bit because his main reporting an everything you talk about is like overnight

595
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
No big deal

596
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,984
It's

597
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
The thing is like they're kind of it all

598
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,896
Inasmuch as

599
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
Rodger

600
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Maximizing

601
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,504
Because it's his argument for getting out of jail

602
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:10,112
You know it either like slowing and killing our economy

603
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
She's real

604
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,304
It's dangerous I know people who have died

605
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
No people who have died from it

606
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,912
This is not a hoax by any means

607
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Very real

608
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Current

609
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Danger

610
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,848
At the same time

611
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
Well some of that might be due to humans

612
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Behavioral changes

613
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
Interesting you know

614
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
Your your head this position

615
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Where

616
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,416
You know you saying things that are very much

617
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,744
Pasta

618
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
The same way that like

619
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,632
We're living in this a couple days after Alex

620
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,472
And Alex said they wanted Trump to get in

621
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,752
Research about how

622
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,080
They just wanted a better deal with China would have completely forgot

623
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,432
Nothing matters so tomorrow there won't even be virus

624
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Bisquick

625
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Brilliant

626
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
Okay I don't know exactly how to explain it in advance

627
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
But there is a

628
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,976
There's an intrinsic problem with what Rodger is put in

629
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
In for it

630
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
He's going to suggest

631
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
That reason

632
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,864
The people want him in prison is okay

633
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Can't appeal

634
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,216
Because if he goes to prison he'll get covid-19 and he'll die

635
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008
So he won't be able to

636
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Appeal his case

637
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,568
Well then we are

638
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
For thinking

639
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
This is really dumb

640
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,456
Why do they want to do this because

641
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:45,856
The Deep State and George Jackson

642
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,208
Before my appeal is her a year from now because

643
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
Which is why I

644
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,616
4 series of completely fabricated

645
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
I'm essentially getting

646
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,296
That's what this is tantamount to

647
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,840
Achoo as a humanitarian

648
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,680
To use his extraordinary powers of clemency

649
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:43,968
So this doesn't make sense because if Rogers entire goal is do you have this appeal the system on trial

650
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Cuz we get to Park

651
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
Like they want to kill me before I can have my appeal

652
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,816
These should also be like Trump

653
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
Don't pardon me

654
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,936
No no don't you remember me because I'm going to

655
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,776
The flip the script to destroy the entire system in the fraud

656
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,080
Apart

657
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
And just like when Ford pardon Nixon everybody was like

658
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,456
Well I guess we were wrong

659
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,112
Prove to me that you wouldn't be able to appeal the case successfully the things that

660
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
But it would be really good for him if

661
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
Is given the part it because then you can say

662
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
If I ever

663
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
Listen I would have

664
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Yeah

665
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
It's works on every front As Long As Trump for sure

666
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
Without the party

667
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
Immediately

668
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Rodger goes to prison

669
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
He doesn't get covid-19

670
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:50,784
You survived Maybe

671
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,856
Maybe he does the appeal and then he loses that appeal

672
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,256
That's what everyone ends up running out of excuses

673
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Yeah

674
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,864
So

675
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
You stopped running

676
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
And you need

677
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Pardon you

678
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,776
And then he needs to make you his campaign

679
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,664
Biggest story in history

680
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,040
Rodger is not interested because I don't want a job in Trump's campaign

681
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
He also disagrees with our coming.

682
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
Beautiful

683
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
And instead of running from you

684
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:34,048
Trump brought you in as a spokesperson or brought you in as an advisor

685
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:40,448
The president has no

686
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Rodger nothing wrong

687
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,568
Rogers & Rogers Band

688
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
And then just bring you in front center

689
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
And press conferences that would be so

690
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
If you something

691
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,720
That's insane

692
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,840
He's walked very slowly

693
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,192
So Rodger will never kill himself

694
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,896
Insist on Rodger saying

695
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:27,296
Makes me think Alex is preparing or Rodger.

696
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,416
Say it was the Clinton or something

697
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
It's very meaningful

698
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,304
There's no circumstance whatsoever

699
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:51,872
Killed himself you will know that somehow

700
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,343
Do that so they come back

701
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
He killed himself that will never happen

702
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:10,047
Interrupting

703
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
What's wrong

704
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,655
Will you kill yourself in prison if they

705
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
Prisoner

706
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,519
No circumstances under which I will do that

707
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,527
So obviously when we play this clip after

708
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
There you go proof

709
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
Spirituality

710
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
Coming to God

711
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
And I'm not

712
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,887
Play because I want to make fun of it

713
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
Chance

714
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Probably

715
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,031
Probably not but it's ugly or gross

716
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,895
Hey look whatever I understand

717
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,551
She tells the story of like going to a Franklin Graham service

718
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,415
There's enough people who probably have similar experiences that making fun of it

719
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
Kind of feel like I'm making fun of other people's religion

720
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,583
Who is Rodger Stone

721
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,655
I'll just leave that ass up

722
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,191
In the conversation

723
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,239
Spirituality

724
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
Rodger accidentally says that he praised

725
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,295
Justice will be done in my case

726
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,855
I'm praying

727
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,535
More important the prank the trumps much

728
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,351
That was part of the Ten Commandments

729
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Can on it

730
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
I mean I know he misspoke

731
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
But still

732
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
He did say he's praying

733
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:01,919
Making a little quick

734
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Pardon

735
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
Now Alex gets down

736
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
I should probably do my job

737
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
I really probably should I should probably do my job

738
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
I can't

739
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Can't

740
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
Because there's too much

741
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
God

742
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
Pick one

743
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Credible article videos

744
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Subaru

745
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,759
26 years ago on radio and TV

746
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
The first few years as the biggest show Alberta

747
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,903
15 years ago if you want cigarettes

748
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
The compound

749
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,423
Well that's just because now you think Sacha Baron Cohen is the biggest

750
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
Story you could come and get your crew

751
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
In

752
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,799
False flag

753
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,871
Flags

754
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
Just wanted to

755
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,527
Time sure and not reveal that their massive

756
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,623
This fashion I would argue that Alex would have a lot more time for actual story

757
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,951
If you didn't talk about how he can't get the all the story cuz there's somebody story

758
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
It's

759
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,303
I can't even stress you I know I play clips that are

760
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
Fairly similar to that

761
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
A bit

762
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,215
I don't play nearly all the time he says that he says that

763
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,519
What I'm talking about

764
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
He's got a break

765
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,615
I got a break he reminds me of this comedian Ron

766
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,247
I only ever saw him

767
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:45,087
When I was in Missouri but he

768
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,159
Constantly talk about

769
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,463
God got to go

770
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Funny

771
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
For him

772
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
Alex

773
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,887
I'm talking about how

774
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
He's not feeling time there's so many stories

775
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,007
And then he just starts rambling

776
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,823
I can see your frustration

777
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Alex play some videos

778
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,687
And talks about

779
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
Beat up because they submit

780
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
They apologized and then they get hit

781
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Or something

782
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,855
Still never actually

783
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,439
Pick a fight with Alex cuz they know that he'll kill them if they do

784
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,511
And then I would start stalking about eating people

785
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,375
Sort of okay

786
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
You talked about how

787
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,799
Some of his fighting style

788
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:41,663
Spider

789
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:48,063
When somebody really bad

790
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
Tobacco

791
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
You get me down

792
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
Do you like that

793
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
Big chunks

794
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
Jobs that people had me down

795
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,031
Size of a 2 oz of meat

796
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:13,663
You don't think the biggest guy gets off my back

797
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Do your jeans

798
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,343
Waterbury weather

799
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Florida man

800
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,399
I I just think back to all the times that

801
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
He's proven himself to be an

802
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Honorable and

803
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,495
Chivalrous man

804
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,847
Very much about observing

805
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Hey man

806
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
We get into a fight

807
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,455
I will bite your flashlight

808
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,855
I will buy you all right

809
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,927
Do this right now I challenge

810
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,975
I honestly would love

811
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,047
To watch him try to chew through some Jeeps

812
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:08,447
Little bit of a flourish

813
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,591
A Levi's 501

814
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,895
Alex you must

815
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Home

816
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,991
Pants

817
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,343
So

818
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,439
A bit of Alex embellishing and making up stories about

819
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
The the German

820
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
Foster children stories

821
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,655
Another story that involves

822
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,959
Pedophilia in Germany

823
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,799
He is making

824
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,127
Oh, settle down but we have this

825
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:53,759
30000 pedophiles in the German government

826
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:06,047
So if you go to Dutch's you'll find the underlying article that Alex is making stuff up about

827
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,863
Fountain inside not difficult to find

828
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,935
This is about an arrest of a twenty-seven-year-old soldier

829
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
Back in October 2019

830
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,055
Which is deeper investigation into

831
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,359
Is like internet sharing of illegal pornographic

832
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
Imperial

833
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,223
The bottom line of the story is the German 37 Oz they're following up on

834
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
30000 leaves

835
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
This investigation

836
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
Not that 30,000 suspect

837
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Have been identified

838
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,231
In fact the actual article specifies that at this point approximately 70 suspects have been identified

839
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
There's no indication

840
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,839
In the German government

841
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,143
This is very important to understand

842
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,447
Alex doesn't care about the story at all

843
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,263
Emotionally charged

844
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,359
Subject so he knows that most of the time his audiences never going to look into any of this

845
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,639
See what the real story is

846
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
You know that he can push people's buttons

847
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
By talking

848
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,783
Teresa stories stories about horrific crime

849
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,135
Because the furthest most people will get is the headline

850
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,743
Which then they'll just take his confirmation of whatever story Alex's told them about

851
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
F*** a disgrace

852
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,095
It's awful and Rambles about this quite a bit

853
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,911
He starts talking about how like

854
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,495
You going to this this story launches him into

855
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,055
His enemies are are pedophiles

856
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,615
The previous episode like I told you

857
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,383
Keep in your mind

858
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Democrat

859
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,199
So now

860
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
This category

861
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
People need kill

862
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
But if we go off half-cocked

863
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
I'll be the victim and get away with it we have

864
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
Walk softly carry a big stick

865
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
Is weisenstein

866
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
Until God deliver judge

867
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
And you'll know when that moment is

868
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
The judgment

869
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,871
God's hand picks us up like

870
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
We do not Direct

871
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
You'll know

872
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,295
You'll know the time

873
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,255
When the time comes it's important

874
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Portuguese

875
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
Dispatch them like

876
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
I'd for the rattlesnake

877
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Or cockroach

878
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
You step on

879
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
Anybody want

880
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
But they will die

881
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:29,407
This is getting to be a very weird place for me doing the show

882
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,711
Because I feel like

883
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
The trends that I've been watching

884
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,319
Over the past couple weeks have been like

885
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,623
In this this like Direct

886
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,903
Talk about violence

887
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,743
About how God's Vengeance needs to be enacted on Alex's enemies

888
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,047
It also makes again how God's vengeance

889
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
The carried out by you

890
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
And you'll know when the right time is

891
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,447
I feel like this is happening a lot more regularly

892
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,495
It seems to be ramping up

893
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
It seems to be like

894
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,335
As far as I can tell we're not looking

895
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,431
Calmer Waters in the future as covid cases increase

896
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,503
The potential for more lockdowns

897
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
The election

898
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
Is coming up

899
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,391
Deep deep water seems choppy

900
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,231
And the rhetoric that Alex is leaning more heavily into

901
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,255
Cm in

902
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,327
I don't know what you can do

903
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,423
I don't know I don't know

904
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,751
I don't know what I can do other than

905
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,543
Here is what he's saying

906
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
If tomorrow

907
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
There is a shooting

908
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,479
I'm someone who's

909
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,671
There's a decent chance he's screaming into the void she needs yelling this violent nonsense

910
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
People who

911
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
Just want to take brainforce

912
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
There might be an impotent

913
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
To the people listening

914
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,143
Nothing will ever come

915
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,935
But on the off-chance

916
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
It's something

917
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,799
Yours that I don't know I think that one is pretty much

918
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
Clear cutting

919
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Incitement of violence

920
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
I don't think I don't think there's any more like

921
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
That's not protected by

922
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
That's that's

923
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
Yeah that's

924
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,111
A judge

925
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:20,511
That's the real situation

926
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Understanding

927
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
What is

928
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,399
Because it's not

929
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
I think that is

930
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
That is where the territory

931
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,055
That's when somebody will get in trouble

932
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,335
I mean it's not specific

933
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
General

934
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,151
To the point of being sick

935
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Specific

936
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
He saying Democrats

937
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,991
50% of which

938
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
He's saying that they're all and they

939
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:52,511
What is a Brandenburg versus Ohio

940
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,071
I think you still protected by

941
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,375
It's really difficult for me

942
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:01,727
Cases are going up in Texas

943
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,543
Austin

944
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
Rally's

945
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,151
Episode

946
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:15,295
How do you discuss this without being like

947
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,927
He's doing this whole thing about the killing your enemies and God will tell you when it's time

948
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,743
Let's see what happens

949
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,863
I will I will play this for you and we will

950
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
See what

951
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
If if that is

952
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
Not illegal

953
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
It should be

954
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,799
Whatever is it whatever the law says

955
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,615
F*** you that's illegal

956
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,943
Should be some sort of legal ramifications

957
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
Affordabike

958
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,063
I mean I guess it's like so much of it is consequence driven so like

959
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,623
Somebody does carry something out then maybe

960
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Somebody can sue Alex

961
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Just a b

962
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,815
We give him

963
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Fantastic

964
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
Trip

965
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
On a private

966
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,167
Spaceship

967
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
And he can go

968
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,495
Into space

969
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,799
Yeah I think that would be a great way to deal with

970
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,591
He cannot come back

971
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,383
So what am I what am I

972
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,967
Driving

973
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,759
It's getting consistent

974
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Excessive

975
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Scott

976
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Moscato

977
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
Delivered

978
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
What God delivers

979
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,775
A real careful that you asked

980
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Finally got

981
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Lamp

982
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,455
But if you won't engage

983
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
Information

984
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
Warfare vengeance

985
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,159
Then when it comes time if ever

986
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
Execute

987
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Silence

988
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,023
You will fall

989
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
He will wavering

990
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,863
But you won't even show up

991
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:09,215
Isn't what Sacha Baron Cohen did information War

992
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,615
Never murder

993
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,431
Jesus was just deeply upsetting

994
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
It's disturbing

995
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
I'm really I'm really not Styx

996
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
No it's pretty bad

997
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Like a

998
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,391
Hello

999
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
The charts today

1000
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,743
That one

1001
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
10 Stars

1002
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:38,399
Tomorrow

1003
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:45,055
I don't know why don't I get a fart machine

1004
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,895
Exit polling computer chips out of people

1005
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:55,551
This whole time this whole episode has been talking about he has a gigantic story and he's not really gotten to it cuz it gets cracked

1006
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,135
By Rodger and then yelling about murdering his enemies

1007
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,207
And finally gets to it and it's just a load of b*******

1008
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Falsify

1009
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,655
Covid-19 numbers in least

1010
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
15 *

1011
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,799
What they actually are for every person with covid

1012
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,359
50 more people that's the minimum

1013
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
Talk about adding

1014
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:28,575
So it took a while to figure out what the hell I was talking about your because the website

1015
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
Just a video

1016
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,391
With no links or citations or anyting

1017
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:35,231
They generally find it's actually watching Alex's special reports

1018
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,047
Very helpful

1019
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Information is coming from

1020
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,423
But I have no other option here so I watch the video

1021
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
What's going on

1022
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:49,055
It appears that someone it in forwards got sent a video from May 18th

1023
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,335
County Commissioner meetings

1024
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
From Collin County

1025
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,383
Who doesn't text

1026
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:58,527
And definition

1027
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Of course

1028
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,831
Probable cases

1029
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
Of covid-19

1030
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,391
They're discussing what this new death

1031
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:08,255
Confirm case numbers

1032
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:15,167
It's clear if you watch this video what happened is they decided that if you test positive

1033
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,263
Test close proximity

1034
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,055
You're considered a probable case

1035
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
Even if you had notes

1036
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
This isn't

1037
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
Position with the definition of bacon

1038
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Confirm case

1039
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,967
Which requires a specific

1040
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,759
PCR test to come back

1041
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,599
The probable definition

1042
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,135
Other approved test

1043
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,207
In the slideshow they put on the County Commissioners

1044
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,999
Discuss how this definition

1045
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,535
Person who's passed

1046
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
Positive

1047
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
Which is the same thing

1048
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,143
PCR test

1049
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
Infecting 15 other

1050
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Probable case

1051
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:55,871
Alex is trying to pretend that this is a situation where they're saying that for every one person who tests positive count is 16

1052
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
It's definitely not proven by the evidence provided

1053
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,783
Alex is trying to claim the two somehow related to the

1054
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,063
In Texas but that just doesn't

1055
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
Make science

1056
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,903
Texas case numbers jump drastically on June

1057
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
This meeting is from month prior

1058
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,511
Also they're less than 3,000

1059
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,351
Send covid-19 cases

1060
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:19,935
We just way below places like Harris County 30,000

1061
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,007
Cases Travis County which is

1062
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
Almost 10,000

1063
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,871
This is not the Smoking Gun Alex

1064
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,711
Thanks it is but he's like this

1065
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
It's lame

1066
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,295
But not nearly as lame Jordan

1067
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
As this next thing

1068
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
And this is where we're going to get some good feeling

1069
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
Okay

1070
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,463
Alex tries to have a bombshell girl

1071
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Oh no

1072
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
This gas

1073
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,607
Is that lady who yelled at the city council meeting

1074
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
In Florida

1075
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:55,775
Alex

1076
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
How big will

1077
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,527
Not

1078
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
It does not go well

1079
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,903
What do you make of it coming out there count

1080
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
Funny people that died of other things

1081
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,839
Just say that just anybody

1082
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
Credible fraud

1083
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,775
I'm sorry say that again

1084
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,919
Okay

1085
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,783
Phone call

1086
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,623
Thank you

1087
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,951
Appreciated

1088
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,199
You could tell that you still on the way

1089
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:13,599
She just doesn't understand said hello a charge for clarification

1090
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:18,207
Conversation exactly what happened

1091
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,767
That is entirely because

1092
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,327
There was a really bad energy

1093
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,351
Between the two of them

1094
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,143
Like she was not

1095
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,935
Giving what Alex wanted

1096
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Out of the interview

1097
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
It was like

1098
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
Stopping

1099
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,543
Start the weather wasn't

1100
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,871
There wasn't a cohesion to it she wasn't yes and equip them

1101
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
And so he wanted to jump

1102
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
The interview

1103
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,247
So you pretend there's Tech difficulties bear do the tollway

1104
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:47,135
Stop doing the show

1105
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,791
Millions of dollars

1106
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,375
Your f****** phone with somebody

1107
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,167
To try and hire somebody

1108
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:04,799
Can't have years of complaining about these phone lines show

1109
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:10,175
Will you take call cover your bases

1110
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
It's pathetic

1111
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,039
Louis Alex having very weird vibe

1112
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
For the rest of this

1113
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
He is not in a good

1114
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,367
Headspace

1115
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,415
Headlines

1116
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
Because he was like

1117
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
Can't take calls

1118
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:29,631
Please start reading headlines and he hasn't written Sidelines before he got on air

1119
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
Very confused by the sudden

1120
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,799
Current class with fascist Muslim Turkish nationalist

1121
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,847
Austrian Street

1122
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,343
Alex do you know where you should land on this

1123
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,815
Antifa Kurds or older nationalist

1124
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:05,471
Is Austria

1125
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:11,871
What is Austria

1126
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,919
Supposed to be against

1127
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,199
Antifa Kurds

1128
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,111
Fascist ultra-nationalist neo-Nazi

1129
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,135
Muslims

1130
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,183
Wait hold on

1131
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,767
United States

1132
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:35,423
Okay okay alright I'm going to go with

1133
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,591
So he struggles with

1134
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
Needing a temp

1135
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:47,967
Because he thinks story about the Collin County

1136
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,503
Commissioner meeting

1137
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,295
Is somehow going to be like

1138
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
The biggest story in the world

1139
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Answers like

1140
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
If I could just

1141
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
You know

1142
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Let's do a

1143
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,463
Publicity stunt

1144
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
Big enough

1145
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
Maybe we could stop a clock

1146
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,351
How about I buy a blender

1147
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:12,799
Do it

1148
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,079
Masochist

1149
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
And there's nothing more frustrating

1150
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:23,807
I'm sitting here knowing we have them by the balls

1151
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:29,439
You don't know if you got a blunder put his finger in there and then you like

1152
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,767
Microchip Mafia

1153
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,911
Advance

1154
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,703
Takes a bow

1155
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
Dobie Gray

1156
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:50,431
So are you get to get really into Spectrum like realizing like

1157
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,223
How do you spell can put my fingers in a blender

1158
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,783
Maybe would drive enough attention to the show

1159
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
That I could get this story out

1160
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:01,439
But that's not obviously going to work what work is if I were able to come

1161
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,255
Convince other people to cover this story

1162
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:10,399
Obviously I can't because I don't know that do bad work that I got

1163
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
Madison messages

1164
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239

1165
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
Text message

1166
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,799
Talk show host

1167
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,335
Journalist English

1168
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
Don't need the credit

1169
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,735
Will you please just do an article

1170
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,039
About this and here's the raw video

1171
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,927
Credit which I don't want

1172
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,487
Weird mental illness

1173
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
That if we brakes

1174
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
Something bad

1175
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
No one else will touch it just out of some weird

1176
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,007
Humanity is a rotting

1177
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,103
Humanity is a maggot covered corpse

1178
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,127
Because

1179
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,199
Does other people recognize that he does bad work

1180
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,247
And he says something is confirmed

1181
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
It probably isn't

1182
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,063
And that's

1183
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
My name

1184
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
That's all it's going on

1185
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:06,719
At a certain basically it's like a Tucker is not going to do a segment about this

1186
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
Facebook

1187
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,351
If the entirety of media is like

1188
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,911
No we can't touch you

1189
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
He still can't

1190
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,215
And 41 seconds

1191
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
Maybe this is my fault

1192
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,079
Yeah what do you mean you can't get even

1193
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:26,431
Friends weirdos welcome

1194
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:31,295
Plandemic people on their show

1195
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,135
Your stories suck Alex

1196
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,183
You gotta recognize it's not

1197
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
It's not that

1198
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Sooner or later

1199
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,375
And it's Alex

1200
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:51,263
I don't know for a little bit of schadenfreude

1201
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:56,127
I can't even remember the people he's supposed to be mad at

1202
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Names

1203
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,967
Send a message over 50 prominent people

1204
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,759
And six of them retweeted us

1205
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,343
To Jack Dorsey

1206
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
Facebook

1207
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
Leader

1208
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:19,167
The leader of Google in the leader of apple and just temperature slight it's not

1209
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,959
Scene

1210
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,287
I really think that he couldn't come up with those names

1211
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,847
Mark Zuckerberg

1212
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Things for him

1213
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:37,599
I think he exerted his memory banks with Jack Dorsey

1214
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,695
Not

1215
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:48,095
On Wellness

1216
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,375
Videos about all the time

1217
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,167
Because if you were in bursts in these

1218
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Bees

1219
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
Waters

1220
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,031
Going to be on the tip of your tongue at all time

1221
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
You would think

1222
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
Can come up with

1223
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:02,687
Hundred different people who are involved in Infowars

1224
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,807
Yeah it's just the topic of my expert

1225
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
Exactly

1226
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,439
And so like it doesn't take me long

1227
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,511
Mike Adams the health Ranger

1228
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:20,607
Gerald Celente

1229
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,191
Forever but I can tell you all about it

1230
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,471
Exactly

1231
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,543
So I just think it's this is an indication of like

1232
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,847
Everything is surfing

1233
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,639
And that's interesting to me

1234
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
Because what under the surface

1235
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:40,831
Is the stuff about God's Vengeance being acted out by people like him and his listeners you are the knife in God

1236
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,415
Because that you can pull out

1237
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
Yeah there's

1238
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:52,351
There's this interesting duality

1239
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,399
And most of the time he's yelling about

1240
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,423
Steph

1241
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,031
It's trivial and nonsensical like Sacha Baron Cohen pranks his friends and he thinks it's a crime

1242
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,151
At the same time there's this growing Trend it's just

1243
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Continuing

1244
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,479
Of

1245
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:13,087
Tell you when it's time to murder

1246
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,647
Fauci and all of our enemies

1247
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,695
And your instruments of God's vengeance

1248
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,255
Acceptable

1249
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Rhetoric

1250
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:27,935
Yeah I mean there's a history has often been driven by the silly and stupid when it's revealed that there's

1251
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,959
Silly and stupid

1252
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
They start killing p

1253
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
I mean

1254
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
We'll see what happens

1255
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:37,919
I don't know I hate I hate this sort of space because

1256
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,735
There's a there's a Feeling

1257
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,343
I don't know how to put my finger on what I'm trying to say but like

1258
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,135
There's a Feeling

1259
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,303
How much am I

1260
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,935
I can't tell how much of this is real

1261
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,239
All I can do is tell you

1262
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
He has a show

1263
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:09,407
If you understand in the context of what

1264
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,455
This is giving his audience tacit permission

1265
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,479
Murder people

1266
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:16,575
As long as they believe that God

1267
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,367
So we could yeah

1268
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,631
Did I I guess I'm trying to stress is that

1269
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,959
That uncertainty is not okay in and of itself

1270
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,007
I mean I can't

1271
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,127
Generally I am not worried about

1272
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,919
A large-scale

1273
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,967
Because I would

1274
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,783
Bet my life on

1275
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,599
The vast majority of these people being

1276
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,159
Useless coward

1277
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,999
Read about the individual

1278
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
Because

1279
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,327
That is who is going to do damage

1280
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
Which two people

1281
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,655
That's the that's the situation

1282
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,471
So that kind of stuff is

1283
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,007
In the wrong ear

1284
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:12,639
You know

1285
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,199
Sure

1286
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:20,831
Result

1287
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,391
Living in that space is really bad

1288
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,439
Like

1289
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,023
Having an audience where you think

1290
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,815
It's okay to tell them

1291
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,863
Maybe

1292
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,263
If you are listening

1293
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,359
Listen to this stuff like that never follow through with it

1294
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,431
That's a f****** really weird

1295
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
Some angry

1296
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,271
Meijer in Texas

1297
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,063
Right

1298
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:57,695
That's because he has created a cult

1299
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
Especially if you're still on board with Alec

1300
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,535
Bikes at this point

1301
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
You believe

1302
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,583
Anything and

1303
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:10,239
Seems like there's nothing

1304
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:15,615
Research has a better position

1305
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:20,479
Trump is a champion heroic

1306
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
It's important for him

1307
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,063
The pardon Rodger Stone

1308
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,159
2020

1309
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:34,815
A f****** stupid two months ago it's over for Humanity today everything is a hoax

1310
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,399
Right now in cases and deaths are out-of-control it's

1311
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
Over for Humanity

1312
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
Doesn't suck

1313
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,239
We will see

1314
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,311
Talk

1315
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,895
He's going to be out of Studio

1316
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,455
So

1317
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,503
I am a little bit fed up with him

1318
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,295
Friday Brigham do something

1319
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,623
We're going to put Alex on the back burner

1320
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,903
I'm sick of this b*******

1321
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:03,999
