00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
It may not be the most

53
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Groundbreaking of episodes but there are a couple things that happen that are breathtaking that are

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Amazing

55
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,984

Freakishly large

65
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
Ewok shoutouts a little bit short on this episode cuz they have another little bit of business that we have to get

66
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
Very important

67
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
Tomorrow Tuesday export when

68
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
And that means that it is the official end of the year of the Celtics

69
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,455
Where did we wind up at 3:50

70
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Yeah right around 3:50

71
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,623
For people who may be around podcast two more recently

72
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,207
Last year around 4:20

73
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
I decided that I was going to drink 500 selters in that your kind of

74
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,215
Eleanor facegooo seems like there's going to be this. Where there was the

75
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
No covid

76
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
I didn't think it was going to go as long as it

77
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,431
I did not either it's kind of felt like that to kill some time with drink a bunch of Acro and all these weird

78
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
A years too long

79
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
For a novelty

80
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
It was very much a an emotional rollercoaster ride because it started off as a

81
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
Then a few weeks later he started off with a roof with a lot of energy behind

82
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Say it is you got

83
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,287
And all the sudden it started being a lot of filters just popping up all over the place

84
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,127
And then what was it a probably Behavior

85
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:40,223
I got a hot tip on a shelter we got to go to the South Side to find it

86
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
Six months ago that your enthusiasm drop

87
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,695
I can only release

88
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,535
Well I can say that a big part of it is the

89
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Difficulties involved with covid

90
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Events at personal life stuff kind of disenchanted

91
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Did me a lot over

92
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
No. Of months

93
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Akira smoke

94
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
Govana filters are not very different

95
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,271
Yeah I think you could take his 2-year in 500 if you were on like a Japanese

96
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,671
Game show where you have to live in a place where there's nothing but Celtics are a rock me all of the Seltzer's Isaacs

97
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,791
50 whogivesacrap

98
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,887
I definitely could have I don't know

99
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
This is fine

100
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
It sucks.

101
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
It's not that bad

102
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
You really lose the enthusiasm to like

103
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Hunt-down new

104
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,175
Seltzer's unless you've already had everything that's at every store within

105
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
Did a couple miles of Rider

106
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,551
Eddie can't find anything else on Amazon

107
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Becomes a real

108
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Was a stupid idea from the beginning

109
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
All of our ideas

110
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,815
Yeah I learned a few things

111
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
One is the wide wide world

112
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
Movies out there

113
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
Make sure and the ones that are Morty like are better I think

114
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
I enjoy them more

115
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
The flavor at

116
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
And so

117
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,759
In order of ending the year of the seltzer

118
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
For today which is the center of Bonnie

119
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Sunwing

120
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,487
Sparkle Urban herbal tonic is

121
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
I believe turmeric

122
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
Related

123
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Tom Richert

124
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
Pronounce tumeric with there is an r in there

125
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
That infuriates maybe I might be a silent r

126
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,079
Continue this is sunwink lemon Rose uplift

127
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407

128
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
Lemon Rose

129
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
Taking a sip I noticed

130
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,087
You playing around with that bottle before the show and normally you have a bit of an energy

131
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Drake right

132
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391

133
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951

Nice yeah that's very

135
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Do you like

136
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
It's reminiscent of those those ones that had to flower

137
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
Oh yeah yeah

138
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751

Thank you Mommy and I thank you everybody who has enjoyed the year of the

140
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:23,039
I don't know if I'm going to do a year of anything else ever again

141
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
That it's humiliating

142
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,671
B&W got the round 350 shelters if you would if you would set your goals

143
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
For 300 Delta

144
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,351
Unattractive number though

145
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Indie Maybe

146
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Probably

147
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,495
Look up viewer decide sure

148
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
Jordan today April

149
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
16

150
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
The Ides of March

151
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Do-rite Juno by checks

152
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,039
We're going to start off with Alex talking about some headlines

153
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,439
Bad news for the

154
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
They denied all of this and Mainland

155
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
Animal

156
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Human

157
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
That's always

158
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
Embryonic

159
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Condition condition condition condition

160
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
The CIA was quoted in the Washington Post

161
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Body

162
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Tatooine

163
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Earrings

164
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Happy things you said all the things you said

165
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,119
This is all actually in different Publications

166
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
The CIA encouraged everyone to get earrings

167
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,311
Tattoos really weird for the CIA to finally start admitting stuff and choose the stuff that I guess

168
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Take them down the most

169
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Yeah

170
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
You know what are you

171
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
Yeah I don't I don't know about this

172
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Also

173
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,599
The latest news on the animal-human hybrid front is it there was an article published in the journal cell

174
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,951
Researchers injected human stem cells into monkey embryos

175
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Which that say observe growing

176
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Three of the embryos

177
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Survived up to 90

178
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
18 days but they didn't create clones or anything like that

179
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
This is a field of study

180
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
But it's not with Alex's

181
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Describing and the scientific community

182
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Is far from reaching a

183
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Amazon it

184
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,591
There are tons of debates that go on by the ethics or even the need

185
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
For such research in

186
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:29,759
You can find people who have informed opinions on both sides Alex is not one of them

187
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Can transfer the bioluminescence

188
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,647
Straight to another creature I was like well get rid of all of the research

189
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Until I can

190
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Glow-in-the-dark

191
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,071
All science and tell everything doctor gums used

192
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Furious with me because I would

193
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
Constantly demand for him to explain to me why we can't

194
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Photosynthesize

195
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,591
But why can't we get a human that has photosynthesis

196
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,663
I really think he had a compelling

197
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
Full answer and I was too high to Remember When

198
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
I don't remember

199
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
90 * 2

200
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,183
Story you know the whole thing about the human-animal hybrids and stuff

201
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
I like to take as an example of actual

202
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Alex

203
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,911
I all along Manchu or remember is it's his version of this research

204
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
It doesn't match

205
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
What actually exists

206
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
The stories that he tells are different than reality

207
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Just remember we were talking about fish human hybrids in

208
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Tanks quit sad human eyes

209
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
That's the kind of stuff that Alex talks about them

210
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,439
Embryos full-grown Fishman

211
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
Wandering around RC

212
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
It-it's

213
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
It's very attractive for people to take

214
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
Headlines and then liquid out of context Snip-Its

215
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,239
The things I would say

216
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
It's not really a cure

217
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
It's fun game though

218
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,479
You know if you want to be someone who plays this game that I was right about everything should I have bad news

219
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
We will all be dead soon

220
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
There is a scientific law

221
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
That is breaking away from Humanity

222
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,815
As it breaks away in extract all the resources of the old civilization

223
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
Poisons us dumbs us down divides Us in Concord

224
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Into the jungle

225
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Urban Jungle

226
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
Welcome to the Jungle

227
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
We got fun and games

228
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
The time

229
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
Those of us who haven't joined them

230
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
Feeling very hard-pressed to survive

231
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Without joining them

232
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
And those of us that

233
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
Habit join them

234
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,607
Will still only survived because the glove was killed everybody

235
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
We're not on their side

236
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Be prepared

237
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
You might be able to survive and not join them

238
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
But I think God is going to

239
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,087
God doesn't like cowards.

240
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
We have to stop

241
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
From

242
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
This is very weird

243
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Well I mean

244
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,423
It seems strange for him to say that God wouldn't like that considering the most popular Christian book series ever written

245
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
Was about the small number of survivors who made it through the Evil apocalypse

246
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Kirk Cameron to Global

247
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
My bad

248
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
No I f***** it up

249
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
It's an interesting version of Alex's

250
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
Is fear narrative

251
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
About to happen

252
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
Taking over in a blah blah blah

253
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
So it's coming up and almost immediately and

254
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
You are probably going to die by

255
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
If you make the Right Moves there's a way that you

256
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
Can survive

257
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
Better the wrong moves are joining with the global

258
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Of course that's fine

259
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
You could survive if you did that

260
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
Even though why would you since everybody you've ever known and territories dad

261
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
I don't know

262
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,271
You cannot join the globalist and still survive if you get really lucky and do all the Right Moves

263
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
But God will be mad

264
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,927
So you can die in the Apocalypse

265
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,535
Can survive it for a little while knowing you've ever met but either way you're going to hell

266
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,655
But I guess that this implies that there is a third fourth fifth option and that is fighting

267
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
To stop somehow stopping

268
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,055
It doesn't matter is Google's have a plan B I was already explained that

269
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
Doesn't seem to be a good

270
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,407
At this point this is really dumb

271
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
You know

272
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
I think that their jobs in the world

273
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Bratz

274
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
I have more power

275
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
For people you know like

276
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Career

277
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
During a career that takes a long time to master let's shower

278
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
Turn over your house then

279
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Some unskilled profession

280
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Maybe have higher turnover rates

281
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Comedian

282
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
High turnover rate

283
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,823
Very high turnover rate higher

284
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
What do you think about the high-ranking globally

285
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
Here's what I think I think it's got to be like the politburo level of like

286
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Backstabbing murder

287
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
All the time

288
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,215
Because I really am understanding

289
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
They get to keep all the money and power

290
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
They then

291
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Turn against

292
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
The nose people

293
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
I have a voice though they get shot

294
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Oh okay

295
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Convenient

296
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:01,023
The globalist in the high-ranking levels have

297
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Tracy's

298
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,887
Crisis of conscience and realize now f*** this noise Alex's right

299
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,703
So they quit but then they get killed so what are you going to do

300
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Hey it's

301
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
As everybody knows from watching our government phone

302
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,103
Obviously the people who run the world have

303
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,919
Consciences that they've been to it all times

304
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
I don't know if

305
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,039
I can think of any examples of anybody

306
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,111
The Alex is ever discussed as a high-ranking globalist

307
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
Who turned on the global incident.

308
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,255
It's a fun story

309
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,375
Explain why there aren't defectors of the

310
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
Picture for I guess Leo zagami

311
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Which maybe Smiley dad

312
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,311
Mike Lindell got rich and Powerful so he's probably

313
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
You turned against the globalist I bet he was a high-ranking

314
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Globalist for a while

315
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,759
I don't know otherwise you can't get money and power his point is you can only

316
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
We get money and power

317
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
You join with the globe

318
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Or if I guess

319
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
If you sell

320
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Or pillows

321
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
I don't think Mike lindell's

322
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,887
Alex's employee who got arrested at the Capitol

323
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,935
How does come back up a little

324
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Okay

325
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,823
My pillow was storyline is not brought back

326
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
Might still be there but it's not fun center

327
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Here's the thing

328
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
Globalist to have a high turnover rate

329
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,319
6th and then end up having to kill the former employees who are

330
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,135
They're only going to kill you if certain

331
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Conditions are met

332
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Never work for new alarm

333
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
I never signed a contract with the man ever actually run the route

334
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
Will kill you

335
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Sidestep the more

336
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
Don't follow orders

337
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
But if you've never sold out tonight

338
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Metaphysical rule

339
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
They'll just try to get other

340
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
Other people

341
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,319
Or they will try to kill your name or discredit you are

342
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
But they say don't

343
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Often

344
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Kill you

345
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,279
Unless you've been involved with them and made some deal with him at some other

346
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
That's why I've never met

347
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Any deals

348
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Protective

349
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
I

350
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:24,895
Are you going to make deals or else there's going to be some kind of an infringing of metaphysical rules with sound really

351
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
Dumb problems with this

352
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
If it's the medic

353
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,063
Metaphysical rules that govern the universe are so dumb

354
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
You can ethically sidestep Murder By like

355
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Vincent somebody else

356
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
To kill somebody and then you have a negatively cleanflight

357
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
I don't think

358
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
These rules are good

359
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,655
I think that they are ungrounded am I are you telling me that Mark rich

360
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Cruz is innocent of all crimes

361
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,799
According to the metaphysical metaphysical rules of the universe

362
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
I think there might be a flaw in this metaphysical rule

363
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
You bet that I think there could be

364
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Yep

365
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
I don't I don't I don't know what I feel about this other than like anytime he brings up his metaphysical rule ID

366
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Because I just

367
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:14,559
I want to know more I want him to actually get into the fl-1a paintings of this really breakdown

368
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
What

369
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
Must be true with a Miss ethical system

370
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
Oh know if if he worked

371
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,079
The one thing that I want from him is a full accounting of his

372
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
It's just it's just brought up brought out whenever Things Are

373
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
Convenient I want a book

374
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Of him like

375
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
Codify I want Alex Jones version of the Bible

376
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
That's what I want

377
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
I don't know well that's what I

378
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
All caps

379
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:50,655
Alex has all these ideas

380
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
If it's not it's not what they're saying

381
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,775
That there were human stem cells and embryos

382
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
Oh no no no

383
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Technology is 50 years ahead of where it actually is all this stuff you know who thinks they know what's up with

384
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
The globalist f****** military intelligence

385
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,647
Army intelligence military intelligence

386
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
They don't know

387
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Oxymoron

388
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Military intelligence

389
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Totally compartmentalize

390
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Weapons

391
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
Atomic weapons are 120 years old

392
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
They had all the equations 130

393
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
That's all that's all

394
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
Max being phased out there is really in the military

395
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,295
Hollywood movie much super soldiers he's really

396
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Cool badass dies in the movie

397
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
Nobody you know you do.

398
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
None of that exists is all gone

399
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
It's all robots and clowns in all robots and close

400
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Fun alright

401
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
So I guess you saw Bobby Bowden

402
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Kirkland

403
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Nobody

404
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,591
I think Bob Odenkirk as a lot of range it's been unexplored nomogram good for him

405
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
He's incredibly great

406
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
I think

407
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
You know it's

408
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
It's kind of an interesting dilemma

409
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,295
Because you do see the possibility of a future

410
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
Where a lot of warfare is done

411
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
By way of robot

412
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,536
You know drone certainly are a problem

413
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Escalate towards

414
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
The point where like actual

415
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Troops are robot

416
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,704
That's right then eventually you're going to get into a point where

417
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,288
A negotiation between countries that is robots fighting robots

418
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Is really just

419
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,944
The financial thing is like I'm destroying more of your property which is robots

420
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Then it almost has a

421
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
Potential to be like well we could

422
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
Couldn't negotiate through this easier.

423
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Exam

424
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Fighting

425
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
So I don't know I thought it through but it's

426
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Interesting thing with

427
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
It almost seems like it would lead to a

428
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
Vast reduction in order

429
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Well I mean

430
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:01,472
There have been a lot of really interesting cuz that's something that I've read about you know that's

431
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
That's one of those things that futuristic

432
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Been describing

433
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
You know Kurt Vonnegut

434
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
You know that kind of stuff

435
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
And

436
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,480
There's a lot of people who were like War doesn't mean anything

437
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
If there aren't people died

438
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,112
So you can't really do any you know it'd be like a video game at that point

439
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Are you better at video game

440
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
100

441
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,512
So mathematically I win

442
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Before we even fight

443
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Yeah

444
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Yeah I guess it doesn't

445
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
Lycra

446
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
2

447
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,496
Like robot drones and stuff like bombing apartment building

448
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
I thought that's still

449
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,432
They're still a devastating human toll associated with that

450
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
But yeah I don't know

451
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
I don't know what about the Clones part

452
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
What would clones be doing in this scenario

453
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
I don't know if you seen the prequels

454
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
Star Wars prequels

455
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
Ultimately closer not as good

456
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
If you're going to use them for Warfare

457
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Robot

458
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
You know we're not sinking

459
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Sing about

460
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,008
Because those are stupid

461
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,616
They're giant lumbering moron

462
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
Quick Mobility all of these things human beings don't stand a chance against

463
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Again

464
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Tapped Out

465
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
So

466
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Alex hasn't complaints

467
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
About the Pope

468
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
Does full communist a sharing

469
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
Prosperity

470
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
They're going to direct how you share

471
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Select

472
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,408
No idea what the bankers have to do with the Pope's opinions

473
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Is that the Vatican either

474
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
News

475
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
For Alex

476
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,000
But Alex is complaining about

477
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,304
Francis is behind Jo bar

478
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,168
Naturally so Alex gets a little bit about the

479
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
Vaccine

480
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,520
And that's something that I find

481
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Flagrantly respond

482
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,664
You got all these countries in a stop at either shot all these coming to stop

483
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,552
You got all these deaths. One death of the one woman died

484
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,184
Like 3,000 or 5,000

485
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Not sure

486
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
Covid-19 Illinois

487
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,216
There's a gigantic unsupported claim that Alex is making

488
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,312
If you have some kind of evidence that the covid vaccines are responsible for a high number of deaths

489
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
They're being called covid-19.

490
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Unspecified stupid

491
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:59,136
He knows that he can't back this claim up which is why even though he's saying is a meeting with nonsense assertion

492
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
The difference between 1 and 10

493
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
Huge like that

494
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
Irresponsible

495
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
Spectrum to be pointing

496
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
It might be a little bit

497
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
Anyway I'm going to need to see the sources on this

498
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,448
Santa until I do on the goddamn a limb and assume it's his

499
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
Dumb imagination

500
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
As usual

501
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
Thousand percent more

502
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Could be anything

503
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Last episode we got them

504
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Of the Mind

505
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
It's between Alex and

506
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Fresh

507
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,392
A hot on the same comedian Norm pattis lawyer

508
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:36,768
He's finally breaking out of the claw game got pursuers real passionate

509
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
Stand-up comedy

510
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,960
Going to be able to be the funniest lawyer cuz that's every comedies being already has them

511
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,496
Funniest lawyer in Chicago at least

512
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,384
Not to be outdone by the s*** head of a of a norm

513
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
Coming on

514
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Is going to be on this episode

515
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
Patterson without Barnes being like you got a book me soon so he's got to come on and this is where Alex teases

516
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
They're going to talk about how the Chauvin

517
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
Trial is nonsense

518
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
Coming up today

519
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Open trial up

520
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Minnesota

521
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Christmas tree

522
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Not the type you I put cook

523
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Cookies and milk

524
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
The Takeover in the police are not getting rid of the police

525
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
They are bullying me

526
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
Event that happened

527
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Oh my God

528
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,512
God armed robbery suspect robbing a woman

529
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
Even guns around everywhere

530
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
Isn't attacking the police

531
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
The melee

532
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
The cop pulls the wrong weapon and shoots

533
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
What do you think happens when you die

534
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Speed car chases

535
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,224
But now you see we have more Riot for that trial got to have more cuz he just goes on and on

536
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
What was Police Department

537
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
If you everything order says an erector political enemies

538
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
Commissars

539
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Well then

540
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Mike Flynn

541
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Where is area

542
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
This is your last

543
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,032
Read a chance.

544
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:29,152
Fires all over the today and

545
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Got it

546
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:37,344
Fun work people off about Christmas tree with cookies and milk

547
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Vitamin

548
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Hey listen don't turn around

549
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
There, sire

550
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Isn't

551
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Yeah

552
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,912
So Alex has a story that he hits on number of times throughout the show and that is

553
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Maxine Waters

554
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
Apparently told Jim Jordan

555
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
To shut his mouth

556
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,568
Yeah

557
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Seated in the chamber

558
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
Congressional

559
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
Language

560
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
I would have preferred she

561
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:09,088
Beat the s*** out of him with a cane cuz we've got one there's a precedence of that happening I guess right

562
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
Look we've got one you get to beat and anti-abolitionist borderline to death in Congress that's

563
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
The rule I think Alex might have the wrong

564
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Angela

565
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Let me do this

566
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
Jordans

567
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
Marshawn shut up

568
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Tell him to shut up

569
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
That's like

570
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,832
Half of Alex's show always telling

571
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
Black women to shut up

572
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:48,256
It's the most important thing to you there's some kind of social justice related activism

573
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,096
Tell people to shut up

574
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
Can you imagine if I was some sort of football player who was blackballed from the lead for speaking

575
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
Out very obvious truths that

576
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
Seem so obvious that no one

577
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,968
YouTube even borderline imagine

578
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
We're going to go. We're going to get some

579
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
Some flagrantly races

580
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
Stuff about Kaepernick a little bit later

581
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,280
Baxter covid matters here's Alexandra

582
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Some dumb s***

583
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
Or something else

584
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
It's the same

585
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Scam

586
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
Everywhere

587
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
Cuz it was never really kill themselves

588
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Pneumonia or the flu

589
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,664
It was an actual virus

590
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
94%

591
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
Hospital coded

592
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
As

593
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Coveted

594
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
53

595
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Thousand dollars

596
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,232
So this is just Alex misrepresenting how there was a figure that came out where was like

597
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,816
6% of covid-19 death didn't involve the person who had an underlying

598
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
Condition they might have contributed to the garish

599
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Considering

600
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
Things like obesity or smoke

601
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Can could be underlying conditions this isn't

602
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Surprising

603
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,336
Alexander Delco just use that stat incorrectly for a year to argue that the death numbers are are.

604
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
That was thinking about that

605
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Android

606
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,504
You know that idea that the hospitals are in on a get-rich-quick

607
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,344
Skiing because there's a certain amount that they get paid out by Medicare Medicaid

608
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,392
Based on covid-19 patient

609
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,256
Tremendously stupid idea I was just thinking about it

610
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Does Alex

611
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Think that those

612
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
Like hospitals don't get payments for other conditions

613
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,192
Like does he think that like someone getting

614
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Like if they have

615
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,568
Aggressive cancer

616
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Also pay out

617
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,456
What's your what's your name to standing and I don't know if you've been to a hospital NY

618
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,040
They pay everything on a flat hundred dollars

619
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
So if you

620
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,392
You've got cancer you're taken all kinds of stuff

621
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,792
They pay a hundred bucks for it's been awhile since I've been to a hospital

622
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Starbucks or everything but covid

623
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,400
It's just it's one of these days I'm actually going to

624
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Sit down

625
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
And try and figure out like what other

626
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Payouts are

627
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Alright

628
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,920
Let's do this but that may be needed for another day because today

629
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
We're going to get in

630
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
Operation cyber polygon

631
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:23,136
I'm also lying he doesn't bring it up at all

632
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
It's son of a b****

633
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
No

634
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
You always have to then

635
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Like when you're excited and you get a letdown do you have to just pass it on to Mega it is a little bit mean of me and maybe

636
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,592
I just want you to feel that disappointment

637
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,968
Complains about things he imagined that Anthony fauci says

638
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
You can buy the clip he wants your vaccinated

639
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,624
You can go out and not wear a mask and go to restaurant that's fauci

640
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
Because every year

641
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
Doubled their wealth are taking over

642
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
They're not going to stop

643
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,240
This is mostly about defending Tucker Carlson about attack

644
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,056
It against him for his

645
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
His segment that he had where he was talking about like

646
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
I was told that we

647
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
We could go back to normal

648
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,760
What people replacement

649
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:28,416
We've moved on from that you can just get white replacement for like a person Smith

650
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,304
I think people might have gotten the sense that things would immediately return to normal after vaccine was released

651
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
But that's not what was being said by a

652
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
Experts including dr. fauci

653
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216
This is a straw man position that the right-wing media types like Alex

654
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:46,336
Some Tucker been using recently to argue against vaccinations while pretending that they have some kind of a principal

655
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Old Point

656
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,712
He's basically a child whining that their parent promise to buy them a pony if they got good grades on the parents

657
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
No such thing

658
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
In December

659
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
20 facts you said quote

660
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,880
Let's say we get 75% 80% of the population facts

661
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Fascinated

662
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,488
If we do that if we do it efficiently through the second quarter of 2021

663
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,560
By the time we get to the end of the summer i e the third quarter

664
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,912
We may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society that when we get to the end

665
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
2021

666
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
We can approach

667
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,264
Very much some degree of normality

668
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,568
That is close to where we were before

669
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
So that's what you were saying at the end of 20

670
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
No it every time they've said even after

671
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,016
But you've been vaccinated continue to wear a mask about least of which to stop this

672
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
But also just

673
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
To make it

674
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
Falling for people to wear masks

675
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
Outside

676
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,280
In September after you told Healthline quote we can be greatly helped by vaccines but it's not vaccine alone

677
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,840
Let's assume that we get a reasonably effective Acts

678
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,192
Not measles vaccine where you have a 98% effective I think that'll be

679
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Be too much to ask

680
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Ask for

681
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Let's talk about seventy-five 80% of

682
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Effective vaccine

683
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Would you be really good if we did that

684
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
If we did that

685
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,968
Ultimately got everyone who should be and could be vaccinated I would think that

686
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:01,088
Together with not necessarily abruptly ending measures like masks and physical distancing

687
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
If we could get the majority

688
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
Community to adopt

689
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,720
Those Health measures together with a reasonably effective vaccine

690
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,048
Then we could get the level of infection down so low in the community

691
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
The end of 2021

692
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
We could start thinking in terms of normal

693
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,728
Alex an idiot friends don't live in reality

694
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:22,336
They fabricated fake one that adheres to the storylines they want to tell them that they profit off of

695
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
Alex's story about the vaccine at the globalist

696
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
Trying to force it on everyone so it's

697
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
It's essential for that story to involve in

698
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
Explicit promise

699
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
From the villains of the story that

700
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
Everything will go back to normal just as soon as you take my emails vaccine

701
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,744
That's not the actual messaging two people like that after you've been engaging it but it's how it feels to Alec

702
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Because that's the story that he tells for a living

703
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
You can see by the

704
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
The false portrayal

705
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Silly

706
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
What a dick

707
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
So I think it's important to recognize a few thing

708
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,848
One of them is that I'm willing to address

709
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
It talked about like

710
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
Factual issues like

711
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:03,040
You know cyber polygon where to bring it out

712
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
Operation lockstep monoxide

713
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,464
Yeah I'm very happy to engage in those

714
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
But

715
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
I will also

716
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Say

717
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
Anybody who wants to

718
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
To take Alex Jones

719
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
As so moving

720
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
Who is a good provider of information

721
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
We'll also have to

722
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,800
Explain this all right

723
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Kind of thing

724
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
I have always

725
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
Address of the god

726
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,760
Sold

727
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
I have been having experiences now.

728
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Private

729
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,720
About the Holy Ghost the comforter and all the rest of that

730
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
That now

731
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,400
I would be pleased to be crucified upside down at Orchard

732
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
So thankful to God that I've been in a lot of pain

733
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,224
It really upset over there

734
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
Pray to God bless you much

735
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
The take the Warriors

736
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Done that

737
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
Call Shogun

738
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Cuz I mean

739
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
Cost of the door

740
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
The door now

741
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,552
I thought you're going to that are just

742
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Ecstasy

743
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
Describe the beauty of it

744
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
Purity

745
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
And the level of this is just

746
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
You're in God's mind

747
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,144
It's all good well to have like religious beliefs and stuff

748
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
Normal to believe

749
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:02,848
That you're having visions of being in heaven when you dream

750
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:07,200
Having just been an angel are you shiting me

751
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Sissy I thought women were

752
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:15,392
Hey this is lunatic level Behavior Archangel Michael visit

753
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
I've been in the god of mine

754
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
Turns out all angels are gay

755
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
But this is silly

756
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
And I think it's a stupid

757
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,096
Who wants to take Alex

758
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
As any kind of

759
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
Sincere

760
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Good faith

761
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Actor

762
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
In the sensitive like

763
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
Conversation about ideas

764
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,336
Woodstock

765
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,176
Eminem's kind of

766
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,456
Maybe personal attack

767
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,784
I cannot have you I heard him say was I am having good dreams

768
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,184
More import on it than just someone saying I've had good for

769
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
Little bit

770
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
Everything about it

771
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,816
Did I take as much more functional and grounded

772
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Is

773
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
Alex says at the beginning

774
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
He was born again

775
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:03,776
Eight or nine when we know that he was a Satanist

776
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
When you were born again

777
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
When your bored again

778
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:13,504
At 8 or 9 had you already paid for the abortions or would that come later

779
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,320
Yeah it what is this before or after the

780
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:22,720
Satanist try to lure you and you you were a functional yesterday rate

781
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,792
Eminator night I was a Satanist it's it look

782
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
If you're not

783
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:32,192
A sickness when you're young the problem with stories like this

784
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
That are obviously

785
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,544
F****** artificial and not true

786
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Played up for

787
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
The presentation of this

788
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,896
The person that Alex wants

789
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
That people to see him as

790
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,992
If you can't keep it straight like it just doesn't make sense

791
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
Timeline is

792
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,416
See how he was born again at 8 and then went to the devil for a little while

793
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
And then

794
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
I came back

795
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
I don't know

796
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
That's why all mythologies wound up in books

797
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
It's because they were like I'm telling you I think Zeus did it this way

798
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:11,360
Changing stories a little bit over time because

799
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Different ways that

800
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,688
The different tellers would tell stories

801
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
To this goes on

802
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
Alex keeps talking like a

803
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,112
Deranged lunatic

804
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
And it is just

805
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Last night

806
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096

Unbelievable

811
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
No way

812
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Describe this

813
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
And I've never seen any of this chart literature

814
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,528
In order stuff I've seen in movies and culture

815
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,584
You are missing out

816
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,144
You have no idea

817
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
What you're missing out

818
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
I just it's unbelievable

819
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
Stop right there

820
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
I want to stay on air

821
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,944
I need the temporal fun to do this and we spend a lot of money run this operation I pay the crew pretty good

822
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
And I don't want to

823
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
Have to do a lot of things

824
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:31,744
David long rant about the god-given vision

825
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
Satanist

826
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Have no

827
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
Concept

828
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
Of what it's like

829
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
So what I'm going to do

830
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,824
Is immediately take the lord's name in vain and ask for your temporal money I am go

831
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,224
Going to tell you all about how great the Lord is and how naira

832
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,368
When I go to bed go to bed maybe have a memory that you replayed your head

833
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
I go to heaven

834
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,280
Absolutely I didn't come back down and I break Commandments left

835
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,584
Turn right because I'm so good great

836
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Yeah it's really great

837
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Being on Earth

838
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
I want to know what the

839
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Those things are

840
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,360
That's like a lovecraftian description of something

841
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Yeah

842
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
Art and literature does not

843
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,480
Contain these archetypes

844
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,296
You're saying but also you don't describe what

845
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
It looks like

846
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,232
Does not belong euclidean geometry

847
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
Find some literature or art

848
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,912
Acute but acted as if it was a tooth

849
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,008
Standard model

850
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
And it turns out there are more particles

851
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
Alex gets into talking about covid

852
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
How's the globalist attack

853
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
Nightcore store

854
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,551
You know I really wanted things I really appreciate about Alex

855
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
Texas

856
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
Good priorities

857
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
What they like

858
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
You're going down track

859
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,719
Cancel been more important comes up you buy a tank

860
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
I kind of got to go for

861
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
Italian lawmakers

862
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,471
Charges of crimes against humanity and more scientists were more lawyers are coming out and saying that

863
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,055
Weaponized

864
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,943
Currency monsters launch this

865
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
The sooner way.

866
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
But that's

867
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
People on earth

868
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
And

869
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
He's a liar

870
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
What

871
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Defamer

872
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
The platform

873
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
Myself

874
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
He literally stopped

875
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
20 + advertisers

876
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,847
And what use is a sack of garbage

877
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,943
He is

878
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Already

879
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,855
But we're going to talk about covid-19

880
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
Of all people

881
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,559
Brian stelter is our big bad today you know like it's super weird to me that

882
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,679
You have such a like a hatred towards like Conor friedersdorf

883
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
You complained about him so much less than Alex

884
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:27,615
Does a Viper that's what I'm saying

885
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:34,015
Breeders free Alex needs to take some cues from you in a while ago

886
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,343
You don't need to be so mad it's filter

887
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
Although if you if you believe that

888
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
Yes then his anger and hatred Selter is actually

889
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
Paid some dividends

890
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,703
Years ago calling him an enemy of the people

891
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
I didn't know this was a certain

892
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,055
Tacos

893
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,855
Trump took enemy of the people from Alex and he was talking about

894
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
88 Bakery

895
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,207
Like a freeze like that

896
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,351
Has never before been uttered in literature or in any kind of archetype

897
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:24,191
That is brand new Straight from Alex's mouth

898
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
To Trump's ears

899
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
I don't believe this first of all

900
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,543
Second of all

901
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
True

902
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,615
Not something I necessarily

903
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,711
Pretty bad so I gave him a phrase

904
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Complaining here

905
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
About

906
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,439
Some stuff sure I might down for this cuz I actually think that this is really hilarious this is one of the funniest things I've heard in awhile

907
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
I know the average

908
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,303
Man watching baseball is buddy's eating pizza and drinking beer

909
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
Sounds great to me

910
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
In football

911
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,567
Boxing I like

912
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,895
You know what

913
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,759
Do it because the whole thing coming down on us

914
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Is reading

915
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
Here are the reasons I find this hilarious

916
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
The first is that Alec

917
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Constantly pretends that he hates

918
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,583
Sports because it's just the media's way of pacifying men's instinct

919
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,423
Conflict in battle

920
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,519
He gives a speech about it every single Super Bowl Sunday

921
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
Particular everyone

922
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,943
This is how long it took Alex to come up with um document

923
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:49,439
Finally this is hilarious because this entire show is based on the idea that nothing is ever going back to normal

924
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
And yet here Alex's

925
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,767
The crying how the average man is watching

926
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
Sport to the bar with her friend

927
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,119
Alex can't do because he's too busy with you and doctor

928
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:04,031
Should the average people he's mad at not be able to go to a bar and watch sports cuz of bounties dictatorship be what it is

929
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
The government has you they've been keeping you inside for a year and they want to keep you inside for your now obviously everybody's out and about today

930
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,247
Tonight

931
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
This might sound kind of like but it's really more something that I want to use as a demonstration but how deeply seated

932
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
Alex's narcissism is

933
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:26,559
He presentation of himself as a superior person because he fights imaginary globalist is more important

934
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
Staying consistent with his ideas

935
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,423
If people can't do normal things I go to bars with their friends anymore

936
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:38,079
It's you see the priority is there anything gets in the way of Alex saying he's exceptional

937
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
It is

938
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
Out of the way as soon as

939
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
Alex will

940
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
Give up on

941
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Narrative

942
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
For telling you how great

943
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,903
Tucker Carlson is coming under Fire from Chelsea Clinton about these vaccine

944
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
Mean comments and

945
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
Alex does the whole like

946
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:00,351
If you're vaccinated why should you care if I get vaccinated review what you write

947
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
I know it works

948
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,935
Some folks

949
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
He's doing that he's going through this

950
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,055
Avenues remembers that George Carlin bit

951
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,127
Oh no

952
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
Suggestion Addison to deliver it

953
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,991
Swimming in swamps

954
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
Give me the area you live in

955
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
That mean

956
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
In sewage

957
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,719
Katt Williams swamp as its what

958
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Buffalo with a deer in the bobcat

959
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
That's the Florida

960
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,751
Don't swim in sewage this is not good advice

961
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:44,639
Alright not revolutionaries you should not instead of getting vaccinated it's not a good idea just

962
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,455
The jump

963
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,759
Alright you get this little cocktail

964
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:54,623
You put some Ebola in it makes sense

965
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
Expect much more from somebody with a

966
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Thanks Mike Adams is a good doctor

967
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,767
Sewage tanks

968
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,327
It's not good for you and swamps are in

969
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
Ecosystem not just

970
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,191
There is a Tesla

971
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,239
The toilet

972
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Swamp Thing wasn't

973
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,199
So this makes glow is a little bit

974
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,015
It's a little sensitive to clip

975
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
From a protest

976
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
I don't really know what all the circumstances are in it

977
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,975
But from what I can tell from the limited amount of context

978
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
A

979
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,303
B some organizer at a protest

980
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,095
Took issue with some of the behavior

981
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
Have one of the wiper

982
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
Participants of the protest

983
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,751
It was probably not in line with what the

984
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
People who are doing the protest

985
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
Wanted to be

986
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,895
How things are presented

987
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,175
You how to protest

988
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
Tested PC

989
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,783
There's a way it could be disrespect

990
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
Go to the larger point of the protests

991
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,367
The people are working at cross-purposes

992
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
Seems like

993
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,487
Is going on in this video

994
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
Alex

995
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
Takes this

996
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
And gets

997
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,607
Wildly race

998
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,263
I don't hate black people because there's some races

999
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,847
I judge people according to what they do they are

1000
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Martin Luther King statue

1001
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,711
That's why America believed what he said because it was true

1002
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Brotherly love

1003
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,111
But I have dozens of videos just to

1004
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
Beat up because they're white

1005
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
You're not welcome here because your wife

1006
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
And the hatred of these young black

1007
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
People's faces

1008
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,727
Is giz notice

1009
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Most the time

1010
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,127
What's the weather like

1011
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,991
Mulatto

1012
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,783
Kaepernick

1013
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Your parents

1014
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
Are white liberals

1015
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Anna baseley.

1016
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,439
In black folks that are

1017
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
Really anti-white

1018
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
Adopted organ one of the parents

1019
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,191
Revolution

1020
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
Hidden behind black p

1021
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,031
So they can do this in clients for black

1022
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Peoples

1023
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,407
That's pretty eventive just on the surface level and I don't feel like

1024
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,223
You know we need to break down exactly why that's

1025
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:34,623
Incredibly for you if you want me to just scream her about fitter

1026
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,927
People who've been listening to our show for awhile

1027
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
Would they recognize this isn't necessarily and

1028
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,279
Uncommon sentiment for Alex Express

1029
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
Despite it being

1030
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,191
This were the first time that we heard him say that

1031
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,591
Go back and listen to the first time we've heard him say stuff like that started barking and go about my window

1032
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:01,503
Really pulled this clip is because the mentality that Alex's espousing that these people who he's determined are not really black

1033
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
Enough for being used

1034
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,575
To push a communist agenda to attack white people

1035
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
Is exactly it

1036
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
I mean

1037
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Exactly

1038
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,719
The argument that his spiritual predecessors like Gary Allan made

1039
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
When they opposed

1040
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
The Civil Rights

1041
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,047
Allen's book

1042
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,583
Communist Revolution in the streets

1043
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
Glazed out this mentality

1044
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
And it's clear that Alex

1045
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,447
Explanation of any kind of

1046
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
Social justice related active

1047
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,055
That's not interesting on its own

1048
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,335
Oz of dumb big

1049
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,663
But what's fascinating is how Alex isn't stupid enough to argue again

1050
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,943
Since the Civil Rights Movement

1051
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,223
Cuz he knows that he couldn't

1052
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
Back up that kind of claim

1053
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,087
It looks a little bit to transparently bigoted through present-day eyes

1054
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,671
That's what I was saying a week ago or whatever is like it you can

1055
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,743
Measure the same ideology being

1056
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Forced

1057
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:48,095
Ever so slowly to be like fine you want on civil rights

1058
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,655
Fine we don't get slaves anymore

1059
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
Fine I'm still going to stay the same s*** though I'm going to do it

1060
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:59,359
The book Communist Revolution in the streets is mostly an attack on Martin Luther King Junior so

1061
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
Forgive me if I think it's

1062
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
The little bit funny for Alec

1063
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
What's the signal some imaginary support

1064
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
Brookings ideas well using the exact same Playbook

1065
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
His Heroes used to attempt

1066
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
Discredit

1067
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,135
And demonize King himself while he was alive

1068
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
This is

1069
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,719
Is bulshit but it's important to recognize this

1070
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,767
When Alex has glimmers like that there is

1071
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,047
Severe racism

1072
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,887
But it's also the same ideas that have been bubbling under

1073
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
These

1074
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,703
Hard right forces

1075
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:31,103
Do that were in favor of segregation they were against the entirety of civil rights

1076
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
Same mentality that

1077
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
It's still underpins Alex

1078
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,967
Smart enough to know

1079
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
That he would be called

1080
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,551
Some horrible accurate names

1081
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,343
If he argued like that

1082
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,391
But even then it goes

1083
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,671
All the way back

1084
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,231
To f****** slavery goes all the way back

1085
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
To being like

1086
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Oh well see

1087
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,583
Whenever you allow miscegenation

1088
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,631
The ones who are more white

1089
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:58,239
Are more likely to cause you any it's just f****** slavery it's the same s***

1090
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
Yeah there's that sort of

1091
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Influence

1092
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,359
SMS other influence the songs in

1093
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,639
Yeah it's all just very

1094
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
Shocking

1095
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
And horrible

1096
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
You know

1097
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:15,135
Do Alex but it's important to recognize these things when they

1098
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:25,375
I wonder if it's all white and God my bet it is

1099
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:29,983
Hidan you might notice from watching Alex's show that all his gaster

1100
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,055
Complete lunatics who believe mostly the same things he doesn't

1101
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,871
Say not only that but Alex Haley to great

1102
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
And I like to flatter

1103
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,455
You love to win

1104
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,783
And you might think like why doesn't have other guests on the show

1105
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,063
Affirmative

1106
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:50,719
Well I have a lot of red guest on the show we invite coming at the globalist on it won't come on but

1107
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,023
Everybody we have on regularly are smart

1108
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
Lawyer Barnes

1109
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
So smart

1110
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,543
Yeah so, you have been invited but

1111
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,335
The RSVP comes back

1112
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,919
Not attending yeah you know I believe that

1113
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:16,319
I don't know I've been saying good work Barnes very dismissively but now that I know Patty

1114
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
Tried stand-up he might be the Dumber lawyer

1115
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:31,423
It really lowers your invites

1116
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,519
People on like I don't know when lately there's been anybody who would be an inch

1117
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Trysting booking

1118
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,871
Sure the people like David Rothschild

1119
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,919
Or like

1120
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,527
Weatherman yeah yeah.

1121
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,599
The moment you asked me for a Poulan

1122
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,391
I could have pulled it two seconds ago

1123
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
Yeah bill

1124
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Bel-Airs

1125
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,279
Those interviews that have happened

1126
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
And like

1127
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
Alex comes out look

1128
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Book a terrible at

1129
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
And so like

1130
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,471
I guess maybe in the past he would have put out more feelers for globalist

1131
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
Then, you think

1132
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
And his

1133
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
They don't go well though

1134
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,895
Now because

1135
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
If somebody

1136
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Comes in

1137
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,967
And he starts getting religious

1138
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
It's going to get bad

1139
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,087
Imagine if you had David Rothschild on now and I was just screaming what the f***

1140
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,159
Real f****** devil I mean Bellaire

1141
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
Woah clean

1142
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,279
You're the devil

1143
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,327
I am with God I've seen his mind

1144
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Wow yeah right

1145
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:43,871
Barnes trial is a show trial

1146
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,687
Are you doing

1147
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,015
Two parts one is the children had agreed

1148
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,087
Guilty to third-degree murder before the trial

1149
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,671
For twenty years

1150
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,487
And it was

1151
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,815
They were serious about

1152
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,095
Getting an outcome

1153
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
Good meat the facts

1154
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
So this is very much

1155
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,495
Just soviet-style

1156
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
Show trial

1157
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,591
Simply because they refuse to do a reasonable plea deal

1158
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Did the trials

1159
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Consumption

1160
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
Entirely

1161
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,575
Derek Chauvin had offered to plead guilty to third-degree murder and William Barr

1162
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:28,927
But the details of the situation are being captured by super lawyer Robert Barnes

1163
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:33,535
One of the primary issues is that according to an ABC News article of Chauvin

1164
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,631
Quote asked to serve his time in a federal prison and wanted assurances that he wouldn't

1165
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
Face federal civil rights

1166
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Charges

1167
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,543
Because he was asking for federal guarantees the deal needed to be approved by the Department of Justice

1168
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,079
But bar quote

1169
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,407
To allow State prosecutors to make their own decisions about how to proceed

1170
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:54,271
Seems like that's stayed upon anything Alex and his buddies yell about all the time being put in

1171
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,111
Into action and also Barbie and like I don't want to touch this

1172
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,719
Yeah you guys deal with it also the fact that you're going to bleed to third-degree murder

1173
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
There's probably not a great

1174
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,535
Know if you say

1175
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,607
He's willing to plead the third-degree murder

1176
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,007
Wouldn't you want to then defend to the murder charge instead of being like the whole trials illegitimate

1177
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:18,335
Also like

1178
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
It's a show trial because they didn't cry

1179
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,431
Accept what is a reasonable please

1180
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,711
And that's a

1181
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Your

1182
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
Determination bar

1183
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:30,879
You have determined that this is what would be a reasonable play that's not necessarily what the prosecution believes

1184
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Or the state

1185
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,207
So Justice doesn't exist unless

1186
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
Equally applied

1187
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
So that's it

1188
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,095
Did the real issue those if this trial is just happening because

1189
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
The demonstration

1190
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
Wants to put on

1191
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
But they can do whatever they want

1192
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,823
What is the left looking for

1193
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Want

1194
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,687
Kim hyung

1195
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:59,295
The left wants him legally Lynch analyst was the show they can use and weaponized

1196
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
The prosecutorial process

1197
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,647
Indicate their media narrative

1198
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
To help push a pretty

1199
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,023
Circular politicized agenda

1200
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
Exactly

1201
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
That's the point

1202
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,935
We can do it anytime we want any place we want

1203
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,727
Even to a police officer

1204
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
I think that there's other issues like

1205
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
The guy was

1206
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
The guy died

1207
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:27,967
Well there's that anyone anytime I think their specific circumstances that are

1208
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,575
I would imagine that in this case committing a murder is probably more important

1209
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
Peripheral for for the

1210
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
The left

1211
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,671
Well I mean

1212
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:43,071
Not we want anybody they wanted any poison over they want as long as you

1213
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,887
You murder somebody we can burn the s*** out of you

1214
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,447
Anybody who murders even pops

1215
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,519
As long as there's a body they can just Jam you up

1216
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,591
It just lie about how you murdered somebody you know

1217
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
So you know we got on the right

1218
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,687
We have a lot of groups

1219
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,087
People like The Oath Keepers who like the proud boy who actually didn't like that

1220
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,391
I'll be at these group

1221
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,951
Well-documented

1222
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
The interaction but

1223
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
Between them in law enforcement

1224
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
Overlap

1225
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
Even

1226
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,631
But Robert Barnes wants you to know

1227
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
The people I can't

1228
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Are actually

1229
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
The Nazi Brown

1230
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
That sounds right

1231
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,591
Glmm

1232
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
Use the military

1233
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,431
On the people don't

1234
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,479
Internal Civil War

1235
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
Well I mean the real model there look

1236
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,599
Looking at is not so much

1237
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
The Communist Soviet model butter

1238
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,927
Is the fastest model the 1930

1239
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Sure

1240
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,999
The Long Knives

1241
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
Your paramilitaries

1242
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,351
Supporters that are outside of the governmental

1243
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
They can do

1244
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
That you can't do that you can use it

1245
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
To do what you want to do

1246
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
You create false Flags

1247
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,823
Or you exaggerate of it

1248
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
The January

1249
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
6

1250
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,687
Being treated like the right

1251
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,455
White Starfire

1252
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,015
It's the same except there was

1253
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,295
Violence and less damage

1254
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:12,159
You know who the only person I've called I've heard to call that the reichstag fire

1255
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,207
F****** Alex Jones

1256
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
Alex spent like all week

1257
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:22,399
Talking about inaccurate information about Hitler's rise to power and the reichstag fire and how it was the January

1258
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
36th

1259
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,495
Storming of the capital they were the same thing that Barnes is trying to say that the life

1260
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:31,615
Is doing that what the left talking nonsense

1261
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
I just

1262
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,455
Like I have very little patience

1263
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,735
This Direct

1264
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Pretending

1265
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
That's not easy

1266
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Entire strategy

1267
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,599
Yeah you know it is

1268
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
F***** up

1269
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,159
They

1270
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
Apply to us

1271
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
The Cara

1272
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Turistic

1273
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
That most Define

1274
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
And their thought process

1275
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,631
And then describe that thought process as disc

1276
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
So it's like

1277
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
Hey

1278
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,751
If they did do what we were doing

1279
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,031
We would really hate

1280
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
Cuz it's

1281
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
Evil

1282
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,895
What they're doing

1283
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
That sounds like what we're doing

1284
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,991
And how we feel

1285
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Wida test

1286
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,111
Totally if they did

1287
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:19,231
The things that we think Stuart Road

1288
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,767
Decided to overthrow the capital

1289
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
You know

1290
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,143
Unfortunate saying

1291
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,471
I've seen popping up about the idea of liking America first

1292
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:33,823
Caucus sure there's no historical precedent of this being

1293
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,175
S*** just call yourselves the know-nothing party and never read history

1294
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,503
Just do it it's a little much

1295
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
Running around writing and depressing people you're the know-nothings let's go

1296
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
It's a little bit

1297
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Frustrated

1298
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,231
And scary

1299
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
And I hope that it

1300
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:59,423
Live be nice but you know Alex is on that tip he's on the Vanguard of America First Shore

1301
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,239
America first

1302
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,263
Kind of guy

1303
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,335
Calls Rochester Lisa

1304
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,127
Because they saw

1305
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
L

1306
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,039
Play far by a long mile

1307
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,575
Completely reasonable

1308
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
Compared to the way biting his baby

1309
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
Changing his mind every other

1310
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,839
So this

1311
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:33,471
That they're getting into some pretty serious like that foods that is literally

1312
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
We starve

1313
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:39,359
To death and his body is falling apart and shutting down

1314
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
In prison

1315
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,783
The main political rival of President Putin is being murdered by President Putin has

1316
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,647
We speak to be fair he's been consistent on that Friday

1317
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:59,327
But also

1318
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,607
America first

1319
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:05,215
And Alex I would I would take this more seriously and actually discuss

1320
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Some

1321
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,775
Of the issues surrounding

1322
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,103
Maybe international relations

1323
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,639
But like I don't feel like

1324
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
Position

1325
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,455
Deserve the respect

1326
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,527
Being taken seriously I mean listen to this nonsense

1327
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,855
By the way

1328
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,303
It's all a bunch of weird Harvard women

1329
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
Man

1330
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,143
It doesn't make sense

1331
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:39,263
Mike Tyson

1332
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,287
It's it's

1333
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,591
It's kind of a silly way he's trying to

1334
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,383
2 formula formats

1335
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,455
Formulate this thing or it's like yes these women

1336
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,295
Feminism run amok and that's why they're mad

1337
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,831
Because too much of a man

1338
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Yeah

1339
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
Hi

1340
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,415
I despise Edge

1341
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
Educated women

1342
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,999
Leading a military what I want

1343
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,559
Is bloodthirsty murderers

1344
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:06,143
Who went over to a different country on Ally and

1345
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,935
Who killed people for no reason

1346
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,495
It's better to be running things damn sure

1347
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,567
Alex is going to insist on

1348
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,127
This kind of an idea

1349
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
Like myself

1350
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,759
Having a very similar response to a lot of stuff

1351
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,319
Nope

1352
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,135
Yeah that's one of them nope

1353
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Kind of expect

1354
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
We're going to get into

1355
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:35,327
Cyber polygon we didn't I know it was never going to happen

1356
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,887
Apologizing for you

1357
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,311
Alex has more things to say they're having a little discussion about how great

1358
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Russia

1359
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,639
Nationalistic

1360
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
He's he's he's Russia's version of trump

1361
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
That's why the Deep

1362
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,367
Just insane.

1363
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,671
We should be aligning with Russia

1364
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
Pisses me off Barn

1365
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
Literally

1366
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,607
Kissing contest

1367
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
Russia's Christian now

1368
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,751
So they see it like the Midwest and went blow it up

1369
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,031
This all just like

1370
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
Essentially

1371
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
Projecting identity politics

1372
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
Ticks on to anybody

1373
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,151
Critique of Putin

1374
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:26,783
It's Behavior because he's Christian and or it's just weird women who think he's too much of a man

1375
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
Yeah yeah it's happened to me all of the identify identifying identity signifiers

1376
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:33,951
But Alex has

1377
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,999
Play Feels himself under attack

1378
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
When people criticize food

1379
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,351
It's just like a rank level of narcissism

1380
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,143
It's not geopolitical analysis

1381
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,167
It's not

1382
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,703
Meaningful and anyway it's

1383
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
He

1384
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
Identify

1385
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
Highfields himself

1386
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:53,407
Yeah I can't think of any reason why people would be mad at what is Funk

1387
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,711
Believe the richest man in the world

1388
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,783
Even if you're just Alex and you're like

1389
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,319
Hey I don't believe in

1390
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Dynastic

1391
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,903
Stick rulers

1392
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,975
I've been to democracy

1393
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:13,375
And I definitely don't want anybody to rule over a country for let's say more than two terms

1394
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:18,495
You should have just alimentary problems there but he doesn't

1395
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,311
Nope no I don't know I think I think

1396
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,871
If you look at it realistically I think

1397
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
What

1398
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
Mostly is

1399
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,711
Who is Alex he's a lot of his identity

1400
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,991
Mirrored in poop

1401
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:32,319
A lot of those things that are the surface level

1402
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,879
I'm a white male Christian

1403
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,207
And I think that she is a strong

1404
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Person there Piggy

1405
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
Lacks

1406
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,815
As someone to follow

1407
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,399
Performative masculinity is what he's

1408
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
It's really stoked about how

1409
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,727
That's not to say that he's going

1410
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
To like

1411
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
You know

1412
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Dumb

1413
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
Boutin's

1414
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:57,151
Number one guy

1415
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
Sanding and trends

1416
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,759
I bet he's at he's pretty over it though like that

1417
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
Develop fast

1418
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
These America firsters

1419
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:08,671
Yeah it's it's hard to go back and see the vomits with which he did

1420
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
Despises Putin

1421
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,999
And then get to the present day where it's like

1422
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:16,351
Probably the best thing we've got second of course to our god king

1423
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
Wow but he's Russian

1424
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:23,519
Wow yeah so I guess he's the god-king there and I wish we had him God kicking us

1425
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
America

1426
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
1st Street

1427
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,103
It does it feels that way a little bit

1428
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
Stupid

1429
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:34,527
I apologize

1430
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,855
For another episode in the year

1431
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
Future that's the plan

1432
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,975
We will see we'll see where the wind blows us we may be back

1433
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:49,375
In the past help for cyber polygon fingers crossed

1434
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,287
We do have looked at

1435
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,359
We are going to bed Jordan

1436
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:05,759
We are on Facebook if you could please find a local charity or bail Fund in your area to help out
