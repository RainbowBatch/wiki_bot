The floors

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,488

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
Episode that we got for you

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Pleasure

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,704
Sitting down

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
From the

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
The shitpost

18
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,824
What you can find all over wherever

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,664
But via be forewarned that

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,688
It is

21
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
But with the eyes

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
!

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
That is

24
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Find it

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,392
And I believe that at the end

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
Wild West

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
I apologize

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
I was really great time

29
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Real life realty

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
Sit down with somebody

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
I have a little conversation

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
Especially who

33
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Spends as much time

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800
Looking at InFocus

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592

36
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360

As I thought about it I realize

52
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128

I'm a policy wonk

69
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,736
Hello yeah it's great to be doing the show with somebody who

70
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,832
Watches as much Alex Jones as I do I don't come across that very often

71
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,672
Me too it's a rare thing in this world

72
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
You don't want me to do Family Medicine

73
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
You have

74
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Because I

75
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Yeah it's

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
It can be kind of tough right it's like

77
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
This is almost like an alternate reality and itself and I feel like once you get that in your brain it's hard to

78
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
Understand how other people wouldn't know it

79
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,352
You know you're the friend take mushrooms for the first time

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
And they are they tell you about like everything that you're missing out on

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
It's all just sort of

82
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Illusion

83
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,592
The only person

84
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Antimatter

85
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
A bit why is that

86
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:43,744
As much time listening to Alex Jones

87
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Better part of two years

88
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
So I

89
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,312
Digging into his narratives really trying to unpack where they come from

90
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
Just doing my research into

91
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
What's the source of this

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
Something I don't think a lot of people

93
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Care to pay too much attention

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
So have you read the book

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
Byron Johnson

96
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,303
Jon Ronson

97
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,887
Tons of interviews of him talking about Alex

98
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,703
And the perspective that he has is

99
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799
It scares me a lot because I think that he could do a lot to take Alex out

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Quite frankly

101
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
Or at least in front of his

102
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
I don't know if he does

103
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Enough

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,039
Yeah like if there's one guy that I want to go on Infowars

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
I think it's him

106
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
You been on a bunch of times

107
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,743
Oh really yeah yeah yeah he comes on almost as amused Observer of Alex

108
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
I guess probably because he has been sort of documentary in the distance

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,959
He never is too pointed about like Alex you know you're making this stuff up

110
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
His face but

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,103
I don't I don't understand what he has

112
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
You know

113
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,527
Like Ron Johnson has that sorted documentary approach how did you get into this originally

114
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
Well I made the mistake of watching Infowars coverage of the election in 20

115
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,839
Coincidence I just saw the ugliness that was

116
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Behind it

117
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
Use myself cuz I thought

118
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
The most part political

119
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Is a little bit boring

120
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,847
Answer why not spice it up with Alex Jones screaming about stuff

121
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Do you get to

122
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
You look too closely at it a little bit I think you see what it's really about and what I saw was

123
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
Just an organization

124
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
To reinforcing whiteness and maleness

125
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
The supposed other of equality

126
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
And it really bummed me out

127
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
I am.

128
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,007
So I just started I started trying to dig into it and at the time me and Jordan

129
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,615
I were hanging out a lot and drinking a bunch and screaming at each other at bars

130
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
So we just decided to

131
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,759
Do that

132
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Please

133
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
Because what was going on is

134
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Weird intense

135
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,255
Friendship that would last one night and then we wouldn't

136
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,839
And we were talked for like 7 hours

137
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,191
So this was for me like a lot of an excuse just a hangout

138
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,055
So that those those sort of things merged a little bit our desire to hang out with each other

139
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,383
Helps create the show and I'm I

140
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,247
My theory my working Theory from about 2 years ago that Alex

141
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Was operating

142
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
A sort of chauvinist

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Supremacist organization

144
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Media Corporation

145
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
For my research

146
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Nothing

147
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
Disproving that

148
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Greatly

149
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
So if I get what you're saying

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
You watching for Wars for the friendship

151
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
Yeah yeah

152
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
I don't like the original conceit for the show is I don't know anything about Alex

153
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,319
What Dan told me was my entire entrance into the world

154
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
And

155
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,719
It has to say ruined my life in a very positive

156
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Yeah that's

157
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
The slogan of our show

158
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Unofficial

159
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
My life

160
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
You can relate

161
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Probably.

162
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
All the research

163
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
About how

164
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Becoming aware of these

165
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
These worlds

166
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
Makes you realize how much more there is even Beyond

167
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
You don't even know

168
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
Right it's

169
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
It's like

170
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
So I have

171
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,495
Sort of a similar background where is probably too

172
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
Two-and-a-half years ago I first

173
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
Hopped aboard the Infowars train

174
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,943
Popped my brain Force plus and sat down to

175
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
You just consume

176
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
The Alex Jones Show

177
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Almost its entirety like

178
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Everyday

179
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
And then on Mondays I would like

180
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Watch the weekend stuff

181
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
My secret to it is

182
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Playing it like

183
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
One and a half speed

184
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,143
PetSmart PetSmart

185
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,775
Figured that out yet I have actually recently I've had someone tell me that I should do and I'm

186
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
I think I'm going to have

187
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
Yeah I play it fast and then I skip the commercials and you can like crank through an episode of The Alex Jones Show if you're dedicated

188
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
It in like an hour and a half

189
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,415
Some of the stuff I picked up is really similar to the stuff

190
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
You've picked up

191
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
You know it's hard

192
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,815
Not to see these like white nationalist tropes

193
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
And also like you said this.

194
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Chauvinist

195
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,031
Mentality exhibited on are both reflectix

196
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,103
The character of Alex Jones and also through

197
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Some of the gas selection and some of the recurring themes that

198
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,503
Show up every week on the show

199
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
Just like most recently

200
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
Paired with the proud boys which is Gavin McInnes is through

201
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,095
Tip for a long time

202
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
And the only thing I really remember about 10

203
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
He was trying to make the argument

204
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Black states with Reverend

205
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Sexual things

206
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
Working Americans remember about that episode was making me aware of the

207
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Krowd

208
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Yeah

209
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,159
Yeah and then like and now presumably he's putting just having like random

210
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
Cowboy numbers on

211
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,607
Lifelike Rufio who was in Portland

212
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
I'm sorry

213
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Can't get away from

214
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,055
Yeah I mean he's having people on that head

215
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
You know

216
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,431
Violent altercations with counter-protesters and stop headlight

217
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
It is

218
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
Sort of glorifying that

219
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
Became a national platform

220
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,279
I will tell you this the biggest mistake that you have made

221
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Not

222
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
Listening to commercials because

223
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
If you skip through the commercials

224
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,567
Blessed left nowadays but back in the past used to have a lot of really fun commercials

225
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,919
Diamond gusset jeans is my favorite thing that has ever existed

226
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,015
Yet he had an Advertiser called Diamond gusset jeans that

227
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,111
We did some research into and found that all of their customer reviews were

228
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
I ordered a large but this is a medium

229
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,791
Everyone

230
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,119
Random pants size and then whenever I sent it back

231
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
The shipping was like 30 bucks and they didn't send

232
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
2009 or so one of the sponsors was the most high family ministry which is like

233
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
Illegitimate cult that was running a real

234
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
Operation

235
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
But I generally agree with you should skip

236
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Commercial nowadays I quit the brain for stress

237
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
There's not much

238
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
Not much

239
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,655
When he goes into a screaming rant about how everyone

240
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Coming to kill you

241
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
And they're going to take

242
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Children

243
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
By the way we have

244
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,503
Easter specials still on shipping

245
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
Really good you can get brainforest you have no idea

246
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:14,719
Will destroy you if you don't give me money

247
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,655
My favorite person who does the add pivots is Rodger Stone whenever Keys guest-hosting those are beautiful everything

248
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Smooth

249
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,799
Smooth daddy is Rodger Stone

250
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,895
View him reverently dancing around the Earth

251
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
Yeah yes please nature of like sort of gentleman brisker absentee father

252
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,303
There's a little bit of a feel like that

253
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
He's good I think

254
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,519
Rodger has a metal

255
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,127
Chameleons are taking on a lot of those expectations that

256
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Alex already

257
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Smooth transition

258
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
It's interesting to see that sort of like Infowars virus

259
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Sex people

260
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Owen Shroyer

261
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,719
We can watch him right now sort of starting to learn how to do the pivot

262
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Now but still

263
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,983
I still maintain that the only person who's going to make it through this whole thing somehow unscathed

264
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Gaston

265
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,847
Like it's going to be a cockroach at the end even if the nuclear bomb

266
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Austin

267
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Just like slink away fine

268
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,319
Yeah he just like crawl out of the sewer and be like we got some excellent specials in the Infowars store

269
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Undoubtedly

270
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
I don't know

271
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
It's kind of interesting because

272
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Go through

273
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
Approach

274
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Alex

275
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Undertaker

276
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
With as much of an open mind as I can open heart

277
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
I try not to condemn him too quickly

278
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Without cause

279
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
I'm so

280
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
It's weird because every episode or so definitely we end up learning things that are

281
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Sort of

282
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,439
Transformative in terms of our understanding

283
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
We learned

284
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
Not too long ago that he's had at least 10 abortions in his life

285
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Impersonal

286
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Paid for it

287
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Some kind of

288
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Mr. mom

289
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
Abortion

290
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:47,551
Reframes how you look at

291
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
The character and the man

292
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,743
Bring this up cuz I don't know if you were listening to show on Monday of this week

293
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
I'm thinking I've been a little bit busy

294
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
With other stuff and I have to go back

295
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
I'm trying to remember if I

296
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,687
Got that one I'd like to see if I can play a clip for you

297
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Cuz we have a

298
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,343
This is something I think everyone needs to know about

299
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Google

300
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,535
Google would love to kill

301
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
Did did that come through

302
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,871
Didn't come through

303
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
R-tech issues are terrible

304
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,807
Sparking SparkNotes it for me

305
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
What the heck

306
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
I guarantee Google

307
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Wood kiln

308
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
Except that one guy

309
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,543
Some health issues

310
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
What

311
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,247
Get it always amazes me like the weird personal details that

312
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Alex WhatsApp

313
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
Because like if you remember back to

314
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
Allahu Kasi trial when was that like

315
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Good dinner

316
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Goodyear

317
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
Yeah whenever his lawyers

318
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Like Ada's

319
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Deposition that Alex Jones is a character

320
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
Yeah played by

321
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,567
Alex Jones he like playing himself or something

322
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
You know it's it's very easy to see what Infowars is doing a sort of stage art and away

323
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
But every once in awhile

324
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
Yeah these weird details come out

325
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,391
That don't seem like it's acting

326
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
And

327
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
Little startling

328
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,839
I've reached my Malcolm Gladwell Tipping Point of time listening to him

329
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
I think I've gotten to a point where I can pretty well stuff out when there's like when he saying something he thinks he shouldn't

330
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
Or when he's lying

331
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,383
Generally find that when he's lying about something he adds a bunch of

332
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,735
Extraneous details and flushes out the story really well

333
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
Are you telling the truth

334
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
It's something like a tree like

335
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
Lead me towards

336
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
This is

337
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
This is not an act

338
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Somebody struggling

339
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
It is just brings me back to that claim that

340
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:52,383
Alex Jones made that he likes slept with 200 women by the time he was like 16

341
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
You remember that

342
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
With a little bit of

343
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Embellishment

344
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
You know it's probably more like

345
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Right

346
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Described

347
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Was full of trauma

348
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,863
Terms of

349
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
When he was a young boy

350
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
You talked about one time he got stuck under a house and they were fumigating the house and he was just stuck to you like trash

351
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Left under a house with

352
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Extermination chemicals

353
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,991
Hit in the head when he was really young

354
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
There's like a cinder block

355
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,879
Houses

356
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,207
Kicked kicked him off her knee and said you don't get what

357
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
My favorite

358
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,095
Because she wanted him to be a man

359
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
He also may have killed his dog

360
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
A dog named Enoch

361
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
Describe

362
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:08,159
I think you take into account a sort of very chaotic child

363
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,743
It doesn't seem that far out of like what the consequence

364
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Nosy result that you might

365
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
Expect from someone like that

366
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
You are very hot.

367
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Yeah

368
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
Disconnect

369
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
He also

370
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
30 years old

371
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Alex

372
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
Same to you have sex at 11

373
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Whether or not you know you want to

374
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
Probably thought it was a good idea

375
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
No sexual activity

376
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Elion has his own sexual abuse like he was truly sexually

377
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
Abused

378
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,879
Play the office like a

379
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
Describing is a child

380
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
Absolutely

381
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
He considers that a Bragg

382
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
So I be interested to hear like using

383
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Do you have the perspective that like

384
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
Alex Jones

385
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Has experience

386
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
Seemingly major trauma in his life

387
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Salute

388
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
You know

389
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
And it's

390
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
It is

391
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
Pretty fascinating

392
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
To see that

393
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Play out in the form of it

394
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Daily broadcast

395
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
You know I

396
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
How do you say that

397
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
Play Outlaw Infowars segments

398
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
Manifest

399
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
Like really childish thinking

400
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,271
Create artificial cause-and-effect all the time that sort of thing

401
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,111
Inability to

402
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Undertale

403
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,464
He always refers to primary sources and stuff like that but

404
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,048
He never actually understand the context of those sources come from

405
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,144
Very adolescent

406
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,704
The entirety of his show as a manifestation

407
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,080
Frozen in kind of intellectual Arrested Development

408
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
He's just not able to wrestle with nuance

409
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
He is very angry

410
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
He feels like

411
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
He's lost something

412
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
Some nebulous

413
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Empty out in the world.

414
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
He feels has

415
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,696
Deprived him of that really does

416
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:56,096
If you so much about serial killer like backstories has

417
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
That you're like

418
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,288
Will at least you didn't kill X

419
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Practically

420
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Maybe

421
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,504
Alleged buyout

422
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
You kind of want to go

423
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Difficult

424
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Listen

425
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,400
To what you put out into the world

426
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
He's affected a lot of people

427
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,336
Was this like

428
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,128
Or did you just become fat

429
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
It was a little bit of both

430
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,832
I used to work at this place called Media Matters for America

431
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Pandora

432
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,280
Collaborator

433
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,680
Oh my God I went to an Alex Jones press conference when he was in DC 1 week and it was like

434
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
Yeah it was earlier this year

435
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Lucky Duck

436
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,360
That was that was an experience

437
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
And once you figured out who I was

438
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,480
Went off

439
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:25,184
Yeah he likes singled me out in the crowd and he's like that guy works for a Nazi

440
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Elaborate

441
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,816
I think I saw this in the life

442
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Yeah that was me

443
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
Yeah it's a

444
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
That was

445
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
A hell of a day

446
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
Yes I started

447
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
Doing stuff with Media Matters and

448
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
You know there is like

449
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
A weekly

450
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
What sort of mix of stuff I had to listen to like Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity Alex Jones said I just thought the Infowars stuff was

451
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
What's more interesting

452
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,024
Or at the very least more entertaining

453
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Oh yeah

454
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
It was like watching a daily Trainwreck

455
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,960
So I could expect that and now that

456
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,776
Do I do work at a place called

457
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,176
Breitling watch which for the money for the record does not get Soros money let's go.

458
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,016
I don't think Alex cares but it all

459
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
And

460
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,416
I just sort of stuck with it I guess in

461
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,744
I thought about like different ways I could approach it

462
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
Anytime he's in the area or

463
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
An event

464
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,656
That I think I might go to I try to work that angle into it and

465
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,800
Try to figure out how it fits into the broader Infowars universe or or zeitgeist

466
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,224
Yeah it's something that's like become really fascinating to me I am interested to hear your thoughts just sort of

467
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
You know this

468
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Trauma

469
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Inspire

470
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,160
Trainwreck that happens on air everyday

471
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,488
Like the sorts of people that it attracts

472
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Because

473
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,888
Alex Jones has mega-fans and he has a lot of them that will travel

474
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Tesla

475
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
Go see

476
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,752
Him or other Infowars host

477
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
At different events

478
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,128
It's always the most curious bunch of people

479
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
Who it's a lot of live streamers

480
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
First off

481
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
That was like

482
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
That's something I've done

483
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,672
Advanced assist people with their own sort of spin-off live stream

484
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,488
Right-wing conspiracy theory

485
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
Styled shows

486
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
Dad

487
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
You know are there too hopefully

488
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
Interview Alex Jones or meet Al

489
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
What's shelter try to get a job with Alex Jones

490
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
One thing is I think my mind is

491
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Employees came from

492
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
Test

493
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,552
Like Lee Ann McAdoo and David night we're both people that came into the folds

494
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Contest

495
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
Antagonistic

496
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,232
YouTube videos and he got in touch with the Alex

497
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
Millie Weaver's by believe fairly similar

498
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Sexual employees

499
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,448
Feed the myth that like if you just go find him and you're doing something

500
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
He'll bring you aboard

501
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
And then even beyond that

502
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
Back in back in the day

503
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Most of his callers

504
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,016
Call Anna B like the best question

505
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Where's back

506
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
The day

507
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
Make a callers and they'd all be like

508
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
Hey Alex I'm putting together an Infowars rap album can I plug it was fine everybody

509
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
So I kind of like

510
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,424
A distribution center

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,472
The place that you could get your thing out

512
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,032
Encouraged ethos

513
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
His audience

514
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
So I'm not too surprised

515
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Figure that now

516
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
Do YouTube streaming

517
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
Has become so much more prevalent that still the case

518
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Like a douchebag

519
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:09,952
How much he openly disdains his listener

520
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,512
He hates his listeners like

521
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Anytime somebody calls in

522
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
There is a certain expectation of like

523
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:22,752
Say some dumb s*** and I'm going to have to pretend that it's okay and he'll just often just cut

524
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
People off in

525
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
And acts like his own narrative is what

526
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
You were talking about

527
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,528
Is owned by dogs live in their own home

528
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
Of course I did

529
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:41,184
And that's why the Chinese are running everything now

530
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,048
He doesn't even to his own guess sometime.

531
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
Seeing that he always go

532
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Prophet

533
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,416
Yeah you don't cut off the prophets is rude all the time

534
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
You listen to what Elijah

535
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
To say I don't even know if

536
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,120
By the way did you guys booked that profit for this

537
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,496
We have a

538
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
All right all right I'm going to move on

539
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,688
Something told me that like mine was going to be here but I don't know man I guess

540
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
I guess I was wrong

541
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
Profits are notoriously flaky

542
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
That's what I found

543
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,928
I would say is my favorite I think

544
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,512
Just because of the

545
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,328
Wrestled with

546
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,888
Are you are you aware of Steve

547
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
I'm sorry to hear that

548
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
Most people are

549
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,360
You're like Alex Jones ever he's on everybody's lips everybody's writing

550
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,688
Big write-ups about him and and all this and no one really

551
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Nose

552
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,368
The nature of like one of the big sources of his narrative the most interesting with Steve pieczenik

553
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,464
Get a call from Alex in the middle of a hurricane

554
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,560
And for the first time Steve pieczenik was just like

555
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,400
Galaxy your narratives right now

556
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,776
Florida

557
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,104
Can't

558
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
Steve was like

559
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Alex

560
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,528
I thought you were calling to ask how I'm doing

561
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Personal

562
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Yeah but

563
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,304
Steve pieczenik uses his like

564
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Formula

565
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,168
Like State Department status to lend Infowars credibility

566
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,776
Which you don't know who he is and like how far out is that

567
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
Dad could

568
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,896
If your goleba like ass or susceptible new

569
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,712
So who this guy is that could be

570
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,552
A little concerning even as recently as like

571
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:21,184
I don't know six months ago or so he was on David Knight show real news and was talking about Sandy Hook

572
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,536
We're just kind of running counter to Alex's efforts

573
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Oh yeah

574
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,376
Hit that Super Sonic

575
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,704
The only thing that saved Alex there is David

576
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,776
Too boring to listen to ever

577
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,592
Yeah I skip it most of the time

578
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
It's the division

579
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:45,760
Guys are human qualities of who

580
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Co-host

581
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,576
Send all of his life

582
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
We all just like

583
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
You don't have it

584
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,768
But that's also part of Alex's

585
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,864
Hiring strategy is he's always going to hire people

586
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
Aren't a threat

587
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
Supremacy

588
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,008
Like the closest one is what's his dumb face

589
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,080
None of the bridge prison Paul

590
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
Call Joseph

591
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,944
Put on fire and then

592
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Just peed on forever

593
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
Isn't even that guy is

594
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
Too much of a pain

595
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,392
Forever really

596
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
Intense

597
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Toxic

598
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Masculine

599
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
But

600
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,912
I do have to admire Paul's dedication to the brand whenever

601
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
He liked me this video about

602
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,032
Boys are whatever and

603
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
Someone pointed out that

604
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,640
The thing that he's always selling

605
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
Contain soy

606
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
And you just doubled all the way the fuk down

607
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
You unflappable

608
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
You got to respect

609
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Okay absolutely

610
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
He has the has that kind of smugness

611
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
You can't punch out if somebody

612
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
You know like it it's just

613
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
Yogurt face

614
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
I just drive people crazy and he knows it

615
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,352
And that's really

616
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
It's great it really works with his like really fast edited videos that he puts up you know it really is good for

617
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
People in

618
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
And I

619
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,384
You know sort of invigorate

620
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
The base that likes to

621
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,248
To piss off other people but put them in front of the camera for like

622
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
5 minutes without

623
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
Fast Cuts

624
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Is like

625
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
Understanding the attention

626
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,400
Cut and and almost

627
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Himself

628
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
Go at 1

629
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,384
Like something really boring

630
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:52,736
And you're like

631
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
So I

632
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
You know

633
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Paul his like

634
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,392
Yeah Master the

635
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Arthur

636
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,952
Creating outrage in

637
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,536
Alex Jones I think attracts people like just

638
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
Because he's so eccentric

639
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,960
Restorative circling back to this question of like

640
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,520
Who watches Infowars

641
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
You sort of had that

642
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,176
You called it like a Malcolm Gladwell analysis of

643
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
Alex Jones

644
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
I'm curious what you think

645
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
You know the history in

646
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
Mannerisms of Alex Jones

647
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Mikey Bolts

648
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
Tell us about

649
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Shivpuri shape

650
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
At least in the most General sense

651
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,864
Dan has the serious answer to this one

652
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:46,752
I think it's probably

653
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
You know in the

654
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:52,384
Probably late nineties it was a lot of really hard core militia Folk

655
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,040
You probably could make a case

656
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
The mirror

657
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,952
There were a lot of people who are dissatisfied with George W bush

658
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,560
Steven probably had some weird left-leaning Libertarians in the mix

659
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,680
Has Obama got you saw

660
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
A real shift

661
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
You maintain a lot of

662
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,200
I don't know exactly when things changed because I haven't

663
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
Listen to all the episodes

664
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
That he's ever done

665
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,928
I know from looking at online communities now and hearing comments about him now

666
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
There are tons of people who think that

667
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
He's sold out

668
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
And is a shill

669
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,912
Particularly for Israel people make that argument

670
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
So I don't know I

671
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,824
The True Believers in terms of like his fan base of the of the like

672
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,664
The libertarianism that he embodied years ago

673
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,296
I don't really know what his fanbases like outside of

674
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,368
Sort of opportunist like those

675
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
YouTube streamers

676
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
People who are full of hate

677
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
I'm not sure exactly

678
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Chismosa

679
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,400
Emblematic of the Republic

680
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
As it is now

681
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,496
Like his brand is

682
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,848
Overtaken by the the Fox News isn't all of that stuff

683
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,664
Because prior to Trump

684
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,016
Global monstrosity

685
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
His brand was

686
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Cruelty

687
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
His brand was

688
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
Whatever it is we can do to

689
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,464
The weakest members of our

690
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Society

691
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Is what we need to do

692
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,864
So now he's kind of left with this

693
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,704
This weird a conglomeration of

694
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,776
Stubborn citizens white nationalist

695
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:00,128
People who want to say they're not anti-semitic yet at the same timer

696
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
Anti-Semitic

697
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
A little course

698
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,760
Inflated Russian

699
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,368
What is my biggest theory is that

700
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Nobody but

701
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
Actually kind of list

702
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
I think Dan who are the only people who listen to what he has to say

703
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Doesn't

704
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
As background

705
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Like what we found out is he

706
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,800
Now that he's off YouTube and Facebook and all that stuff

707
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
He's on like

708
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
830 radio stations

709
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,200
Give or take

710
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
Who's to say how many likes

711
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
200 population

712
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Something

713
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,720
Might have a ton of little tiny town

714
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
Around the country

715
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Of major and mediamarkt

716
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Confound His Radio

717
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Reach is much smaller

718
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Yeah and

719
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Something I've been watching it

720
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
You know app

721
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,920
Since Alex Jones has been pulled off

722
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
Aldi

723
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
Platforms

724
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
You know if there was like a relative spike in interest

725
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
And you know

726
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
In as result

727
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,672
Traffic to the Infowars site like right after that happened

728
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,000
Now it's starting to fall back down

729
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
Sort of closer to the normal range

730
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,144
And I'm wondering if it'll stay at that normal range or if we'll see that

731
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Start to dwindle

732
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:34,080
Well it's like a black one Breitbart artificial when they had to remove

733
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,408
The there's an article about

734
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
Suspicious patterns

735
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
Breitbart's traffic

736
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Almost

737
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Vertical line

738
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
Is there traffic

739
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,696
Around that level

740
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:55,072
Another vertical line

741
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,144
Clearly indicates artificial inflation of traffic

742
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
And I don't I don't know

743
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,264
I don't know what to expect from Alex I knows it

744
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,152
Whatever interest he got like with him bragging about being the number one app and stuff like that

745
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,224
That was even overblown

746
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
Trending apps

747
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
Because everyone was running to it

748
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Like rats

749
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
To get off a sinking ship

750
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
I needed something

751
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
Candy Crush

752
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,072
Or whatever it is probably

753
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:33,472
I think back to normal is probably where you going to be for a bit

754
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
I think that he has a built-in narrative about that

755
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,872
I think people are still invested in trying to

756
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,456
I see him through on whatever

757
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Story

758
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,624
The storyline of this season of the show is his I'm a free speech martyr and that's

759
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Conclusion

760
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
And then I think a problem

761
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
Either way whether the Republic

762
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
Terms or

763
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
They lose control of the house

764
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,496
I think either way Alex

765
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Kind of

766
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,336
Loses a lot of momentum in a lot of natural interest

767
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
So I

768
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Infowars being pulled off

769
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,040
Somebody's bigger platforms

770
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,856
Little bit of a disclaimer I had sort of

771
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
What ended up being

772
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,208
A little bit of an accidental roll

773
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,768
You were that you were the Spotify guy

774
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,328
Yeah but I was the one who got Spotify

775
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,168
And in that like to sort of snowball then

776
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,496
I had no idea it was going to turn into what it turned into but

777
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
Here we are today and I'm curious to get

778
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,152
Someone else who like understands that enforce universes

779
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
Kcon like

780
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
What now

781
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
It works like

782
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
You do

783
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
How does this affect

784
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
The Brandt

785
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
Simply on it as as somebody who doesn't study and it is only there to react on it and create my

786
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,656
Nonsense series

787
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
I think

788
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,984
He's actually done

789
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
Like I don't think he's

790
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,080
Because right now he's the cause

791
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
For so many of these people

792
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,432
And as we know from any cause

793
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,272
Twitter and and all that stuff is going to

794
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,320
Let it go after a couple of weeks

795
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,624
And once he stops being the cause

796
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
Hi there cost 11

797
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
As it as it was

798
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
He is just going to disappear

799
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,352
And it's just going to be people even the ones who are hardcore listeners

800
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,144
Bored

801
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,984
Cuz that's we've listened to over a over the recent

802
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
Episode

803
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,104
He's really kind of putting out the same nonsense

804
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,408
It's not as much fun

805
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:01,696
I feel like what you did believe I believe it was that you were

806
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Like gunning

807
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,280
Or anything like that

808
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
I think that's what you were in essence was kind of forced The Narrative forward cuz he's in a bit of a holding pen

809
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:17,056
Pattern getting kicked off stuff you able to progressed to the next logical step

810
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
I'm a victim I am

811
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,200
The first Target in terms of free speech x y and z

812
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,784
And when they started to happen one of my

813
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
Firm convictions I believe

814
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,488
To use that as a jumping-off point

815
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
To do something else

816
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
If you need it not like turn on Trump

817
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
Really going full any Bruce

818
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
Like getting down to the brass tacks

819
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:55,455
Sitting on his show as boring as it may be reading over regulations reading over

820
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,527
Terms-of-service agreements or something like that

821
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
You know trying to like make it make himself

822
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
Respectable legitimate

823
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Argument

824
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
Because he never does that

825
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,047
And when we started to listen to the episode Zachary got kicked off of like Facebook

826
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
YouTube

827
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,727
You just saw him doing the exact same thing and like it's just yelling about to try calms screaming about how soros's

828
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
Is evil

829
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,383
Just doing the same like I got to sell my fish oil all that stuff

830
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
I got the sense of it like

831
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:31,295
He's either waving a white flag of surrender or he doesn't realize that he's already dead in the water

832
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
There's nothing

833
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
There's nowhere to go past

834
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,927
The end of this narrative

835
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
If that makes sense

836
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,303
The most exciting moment I think for us

837
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
With Alex and

838
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
In present day

839
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,215
Was whatever he said that Trump shaved ices up in dirty ass hoe

840
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:53,055
That was the night that truck that Trump a bomb Syria

841
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
We were we were both watching him in this

842
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
Transformation from

843
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,783
Crazy guy who screams about

844
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,855
And then becoming just the guy who's

845
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
The partisan hack

846
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,463
The Republicans are great

847
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
Sister trying to kill you kill you

848
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:17,119
I know that night we we could have seen the real turning point for him

849
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
He could have changed his narrative

850
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
And become something so much

851
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,031
Better than what it is right now

852
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
No cuz that

853
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Turn on Trump

854
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
And be like I'm going

855
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
I'm going to

856
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Hero

857
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,863
And in reality what you need to do is shut up

858
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
You help

859
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:55,263
Make this mess that we're in we don't need you to clean it up he's like a baby who knocks over a bottle

860
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,847
And then doesn't know how to clean but it's let me know

861
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
You just be like baby go sit in the corner I'll take care of this

862
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
Cept adults need to step in

863
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
No I'm not mad at you

864
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,319
Yeah don't because like

865
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:13,439
What if I am remembering that same night which I presume that I am it's a

866
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
He didn't

867
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:21,119
You said to turn on Trump really defy him in a major way and said it was like Trump we love you we elected you for a reason but

868
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
But this wasn't good

869
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,519
No no by the end of the night he was very much like

870
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
We got it we're on our own now

871
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
He was putting out

872
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,223
Owen Shroyer biocides

873
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
To keep things going

874
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:44,159
Eoin troyer's look of surprise after every sentence eSATA just like

875
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:48,767
We should have had a projection

876
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:55,167
I believe in 1.0 and was like oh wait wait I remember this

877
00:44:55,423 --> 00:45:00,543
Okay

878
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,175
It's a good thing

879
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,183
Slip on truck mode

880
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:21,791
And then the next day he got on his show and said everything is cool

881
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
We still support Trump

882
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,519
Furiously or called him all night

883
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
Trying to convince him otherwise

884
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
That's part of my mother.

885
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,039
Oh I think I found this is this when he's like

886
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,439
Donald Trump s*** his f****** pants of the f****** moment should all over everybody

887
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
That moment right

888
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,839
Strong work that night that was a real

889
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:00,959
Cooking cult for Donald Trump was a good night

890
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,007
Okay yeah I remember this

891
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
That was like one of the last

892
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
Most recent times that I've been like that Alex

893
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,575
Investigated 2015

894
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,671
Because

895
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
2 episode

896
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
Serious

897
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,815
We really streamline when we put out

898
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,119
3 hour episodes

899
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,703
55 hour-long presentation

900
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,751
I wanted to go back to

901
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,311
2015 exact date

902
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Trump

903
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,687
Beware Alex jumped on Tori

904
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
To see you

905
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,295
Interesting

906
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:52,415
Even though everyone was saying that Alex Jones is the voice of trump or whatever

907
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,463
And clearly Alex was on

908
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
Don't have any idea why

909
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:02,655
And I wanted to try and figure that out so I spent countless hours at my job

910
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,727
I just going over listening to all the episodes

911
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,007
Taking notes

912
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,591
I found it was the most surprising was that

913
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,663
When Trump announced his candidacy

914
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,783
He was very clear about how Donald Trump was part of the mob

915
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:23,647
He said that Trump was a front man for Consortium is on the East Coast

916
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,951
He was a bad bad guy

917
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
He knows from

918
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
Deep deep sources

919
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,191
If you have a name like Corleone you get arrested if you have a name like Trump

920
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
You don't

921
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,031
She was just very clearly

922
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:45,151
Coming out with like I know that this guy is involved with illegal Financial operations

923
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,431
And stuff like that

924
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,759
I meant over the course of months we saw him

925
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Go from

926
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
Is that position to

927
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,367
Jesus's guys meme

928
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
He hates immigrants I like that

929
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,719
But I still love Rand Paul

930
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,047
Yeah never wavered on that point at all for

931
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,863
For months and months and then it happened in a week

932
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,959
Well actually this is one of the misconceptions that aren't people

933
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,519
A lot of people

934
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
Rodger Stone

935
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
Alex

936
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
And that's not true at all

937
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
Rodger Stone showed up on November 9th

938
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
First appearance

939
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
And you did some good work

940
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
Get out

941
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
You like him

942
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,279
He carries a gun everywhere

943
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,839
Nordstrom

944
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
Until the middle of December

945
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:43,007
I guess you didn't even get on board with him and say this is our guy rampal's not good enough

946
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Right

947
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
The hip-hop was much more complicated

948
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,295
It was really

949
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
It was really

950
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,207
Then it was a slow transition I admit

951
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,047
I do think that the rhetoric happen

952
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Though

953
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Very quick

954
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,679
Like even near the end of his is

955
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
Eventually

956
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
Love of trump

957
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,799
Eevee evolution that took a while

958
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
It was still like

959
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:25,247
Well you know rampal's my guy but I'm starting to like this Trump fella he hates non-white people and I

960
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:29,087
And then all the sudden

961
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
It went from

962
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,951
Is still

963
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
2

964
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
Is a secret

965
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
Leaper

966
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
He has been

967
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:45,727
He has been working undercover for 30 years himself

968
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,543
We all need to save us

969
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
Is the messiah

970
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
No you're wrong though

971
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,967
I apologize

972
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,039
You're my favorite what your recounting is like

973
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,623
Essential plotline have you guys read Jerome corsi book

974
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
Qanon

975
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,791
That killing the Deep State yeah

976
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,423
Admit I spent a lot of time looking only Warriors

977
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
But I don't have time

978
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,007
I don't have time to read

979
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,079
I got eight sit some excellent fanfiction

980
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
Probably some of the most creative type read in a while

981
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,039
Alex 2015

982
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
Was full of s***

983
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
And that he didn't mean

984
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
A president

985
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
Writing a book

986
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,351
Elvis fanfiction is kind of like exactly the opposite of what he was saying

987
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Interesting

988
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,751
Did the reality though Georgia

989
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,287
Is this

990
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,591
This is it this is essentially or podcast

991
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,407
Explained

992
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:03,551
He didn't switch to Trump as our savior until a bit later

993
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,855
Because of

994
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
That narrative

995
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Dementia

996
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
He's working

997
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
Behind the scenes

998
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,487
There's a deal

999
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
Tween

1000
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
Assad

1001
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,607
And our Rogue military

1002
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:20,703
Counter to narrative is as we refer to it

1003
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,751
That was being told to him

1004
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
By Rodger Stone

1005
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,687
Who are working together in a group that they have on are referred to as the 45 group

1006
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,295
I'm convinced that the two of them

1007
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,343
In concert to try and slip Alex Jones

1008
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
Because they knew of his propaganda potential

1009
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
And that happen

1010
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,207
Towards the end

1011
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
2015

1012
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,023
Probably December

1013
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Winthrop

1014
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
Beard on in Fort Worth

1015
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:52,703
Yeah I'm curious you know especially as we go into the midterms now woodenware

1016
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,007
Recording this you know we've had

1017
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
Sitting Congress

1018
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
People

1019
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Encino

1020
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,639
Congressional candidates in

1021
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,991
That's where the thing appeared on Infowars I think just

1022
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
For the sake

1023
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Of

1024
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
The size of the audience

1025
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,623
I guess it once had knotted

1026
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,695
Haven't seen any like real numbers

1027
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
Recently

1028
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,791
A ants just ordered that idea that

1029
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,351
You know it is a propaganda tool

1030
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,191
I'm really curious to see you do now that

1031
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,799
Infowars has been pulled from so many platforms if we're going to see

1032
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
The same type of

1033
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
High-profile

1034
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,175
You know figures holding power

1035
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:38,015
Who are trying to wield Infowars in the same way or if it's

1036
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,807
Guinness Swordigo the way.

1037
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,343
The Breitbart did

1038
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,647
Arkansas get some gas

1039
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
High-profile cast but

1040
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,535
It's not this it's not thought of as the same like

1041
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,815
Realty

1042
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,607
Attack dog

1043
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Sort of

1044
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
Outlet that it once was

1045
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
Yeah

1046
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,983
I mean

1047
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,823
Gates was the last episode of sitting politician

1048
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,847
Who's going on

1049
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,663
Yeah and he went on there and complained about getting called

1050
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,479
Conspiracy theorist which was just beautiful

1051
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:13,599
Apologize for going on

1052
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Which

1053
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:20,255
I think it's reach even within his own

1054
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Krewe of guests

1055
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
Like Mike Go On

1056
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,679
Just a panther

1057
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
Like Matt gaetz

1058
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
Was doing

1059
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,335
I think that even some of those other people who are just

1060
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,639
Will realize that

1061
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
This is not a prophet

1062
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Affordable

1063
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
Place for us to go on

1064
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Anymore

1065
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,855
A lot of his like roster of guests will diminish

1066
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,951
And that's one of the big things that we at least I have learned from

1067
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,351
Alex's cast

1068
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Characters

1069
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,215
Is that these are all con men trying to run their own game

1070
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,799
Kind of hanging out like you were saying the the guys who are

1071
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,407
Hangers-on trying to get their own YouTube show with

1072
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,735
Alex's

1073
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,807
We see so many different people who go from

1074
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,879
Alex Jones

1075
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
What is it

1076
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
Kerry Cassidy

1077
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
Project Camelot and then we've got

1078
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,351
The same people going on Jim Bakker

1079
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,167
Shelf and all of this stuff we find is

1080
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
People running app

1081
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,775
Khan and then the other comment kind of propping them up

1082
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,335
Ecosystem

1083
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Confidence

1084
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,199
Most of the media sphere

1085
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:49,599
If you look at like who's a regular guest on Alex Jones it's a peep

1086
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,647
Mike Stern

1087
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:54,463
People like Rogers donut people

1088
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,559
There people that you do

1089
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,399
They have their own weather it's like some b*******

1090
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,935
Book or

1091
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,775
No like some of these guys have their own their own supplement line

1092
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:11,103
You know or whatever through selling you do I

1093
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
I grew that I think

1094
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
Yep

1095
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
I did not look at

1096
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:19,295
Gastro Tatian and it's a relatively small pool of people

1097
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
And

1098
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
They all have their own

1099
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,159
S*** that they're trying to do

1100
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
And

1101
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,743
I almost wonder if that's

1102
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:32,607
Like another indicative sign of sort of like the stage of Infowars and its growth

1103
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,375
We're

1104
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,215
People are coming on Infowars to be on Infowars not because like

1105
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
Anything substantial or

1106
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,615
You know major Lecom consequential is happening on the platformer

1107
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,943
That expect to wield like real influence anymore

1108
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,015
I think it's some people definitely did

1109
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,831
Before

1110
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,743
We sometimes cover Project Camelot and Jim Bakker episodes

1111
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Do the same

1112
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
Sort of, maneuvers

1113
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,351
Episode of Jim Bakker

1114
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
The guest book

1115
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
He buys it

1116
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
The ton of their books

1117
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,311
And then he sells them

1118
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:18,431
So there's a financial incentive for the guests to come on cuz they automatically sell this large

1119
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
Jungle Book

1120
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,295
And when you look at Alex Jones as business model with the Infowars store

1121
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,623
Most of the time when these guests come on he's selling their books

1122
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
Store

1123
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,815
Probably I can't confirm this necessarily but it only stands to reason that a lot of these guests were coming on

1124
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
End up selling

1125
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:42,495
5000 books to Alex for the appearance that there's an in-kind

1126
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
Version of pay-to-play

1127
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
What's going on with

1128
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,127
Like a consignment deal with hydraulics

1129
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,967
A lot of people as we move forward

1130
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:56,063
With his diminished reach won't see that as an investment worthwhile anymore

1131
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
I know probably end up having to

1132
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:05,023
Go way down the batting order

1133
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,631
Smaller rotating cast of characters like when we go back in time with Alex

1134
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:14,751
One of my favorites was what's-his-name general stubblebine or whatever he's dead

1135
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:20,895
When he went on the show his wife was essentially selling a $25 postcard

1136
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
With a magic set

1137
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:28,319
That would get you out of any crime no no no it's gets you out of getting vaccinated

1138
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:34,719
That's right there is even better

1139
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
The kind of

1140
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,703
Crazy

1141
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
How bad

1142
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
As long as we keep healthy

1143
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Ranger bike

1144
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
I think we'll be good

1145
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,807
Did you read his report that apparently got to the president

1146
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,903
No I didn't read the Adams report

1147
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,863
It was a it was a long day today

1148
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:20,031
It was a

1149
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
The state of

1150
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
Conservative Shadow Banning

1151
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,895
President

1152
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,919
I regret it.

1153
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
51st state

1154
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:33,343
I knew that he was sending that but I didn't realize it was Health Ranger Mike doing it

1155
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
What's the

1156
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:41,535
Health Ranger Mike is allowed to do any of the

1157
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:45,119
They are the proprietor of naturalnews.com

1158
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:51,775
All kinds of your medical whenever you want to not believe he'll help you not believe it

1159
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:58,175
Nothing like he he'll have health Ranger Mike on every once in awhile just to be like we've tested the supplements there

1160
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Fantastic

1161
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,247
Also you don't need vaccines

1162
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Yep

1163
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Marcos

1164
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,391
Hey come on ginkgo biloba

1165
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:14,047
Deep Earth iodine

1166
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,399
Although supplements

1167
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,935
They're all brats

1168
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Do you buy.

1169
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
He's a chiropractor

1170
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Website he has all the exact same products for sale just with different names that kind of sounds

1171
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Like medicine

1172
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,135
Had a really interesting Dynamic of the two of them have where they sell the same stuff

1173
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,207
Doctor groups sounds like medicine

1174
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
Alex sounds like

1175
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,255
Combat

1176
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Because

1177
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
Thanos

1178
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,143
I mean it's the same thing it's the

1179
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,703
That's another version of the same Khan

1180
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:56,799
It's like they have their own it's like they all have their own private label

1181
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,871
Like they all buy it from the same

1182
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,895
Retail

1183
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,575
More likely doctor group buys all of it puts it all together and then

1184
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,623
Alex

1185
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
People's book

1186
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
In theory

1187
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Soccer group

1188
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,255
Stop on private label

1189
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:22,143
Doctor group putting it all together himself like he has a workshop like that

1190
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,823
I think we should go ahead and

1191
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,639
Start to wrap this now that we have

1192
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,663
Have finally

1193
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,967
Discovered once and for all

1194
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
That

1195
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,319
You know the Infowars products really are

1196
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,415
As good as they say it's.

1197
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,487
SAR

1198
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:54,655
I can't get out of bed in the morning unless I have my bone broth

1199
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
I just

1200
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:02,079
The only thing it might my big takeaway I think the big thing that we discovered

1201
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,127
This evening is that

1202
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,151
You know with

1203
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:09,759
With fewer people going on the Alex Jones Show I think the Jim Bakker Show is about to get

1204
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
Way

1205
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,343
More popping off

1206
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,415
I'll tell you it's already been

1207
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:24,351
The lady

1208
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,679
Who Paula White Cain

1209
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,031
Who is deed single greatest con artist I think we've had

1210
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
Europe has a

1211
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:38,943
At least like in the originals

1212
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,015
Definitely make sure to pin a note to your chest that says call

1213
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,463
In a way that somehow she gave a benediction for

1214
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,583
Whatever sort of personal preacher

1215
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:02,239
There's nobody who could be less aligned with any kind of Christian theology that you could imagine Ramon

1216
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,543
Keyboardist from Journey

1217
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
Deathstroke

1218
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
That's great

1219
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
Screw

1220
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,407
That's enough for me I don't know

1221
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
Blika blika

1222
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:16,063
I would say it is interesting that you're putting it that way Jim Baker's about

1223
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
Papa

1224
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,903
I think he's already reached his is sort of

1225
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,975
Xena as it were

1226
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
Plateaued

1227
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
He's going to stay about where you

1228
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,095
I say keep your eyes on

1229
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
Something like

1230
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
Project Camelot

1231
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,519
I think I think that's much more likely to get really popular

1232
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
Because that

1233
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,335
Really friend

1234
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
That's really weird

1235
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:47,295
What space program all the time and have like weird Liars on and the biggest guess they have is a murderer from 19

1236
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
93 whatever it is

1237
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
The Pendragon

1238
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:56,255
By the way

1239
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,047
Just so you know anytime

1240
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,839
You try and wrap up a show

1241
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:06,239
We're going to wind up talking for 85 more minutes please just be as insistent as possible

1242
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,335
Well the show

1243
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,991
Stamps should I just answer everything with that

1244
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:23,135
End the phone call

1245
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
It's nice to speak to somebody

1246
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
This is on this.

1247
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
And now you're my personal life

1248
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,167
Yeah it was a real pleasure

1249
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
Wonderful

1250
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
So

1251
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,335
My podcast where the can they check out knowledge fight

1252
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,015
The best thing to do

1253
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,599
Is a Facebook group

1254
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,695
It's called go home and tell your mother you're brilliant which is

1255
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,535
Clip that I was talking about with Steve pieczenik earlier where he

1256
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,351
Bitched out on Alex for a while

1257
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,423
He just a game

1258
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,543
Great you did a good job go home and tell your brother your mother your biliary your brilliant five stars

1259
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,311
Whatever is

1260
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Bananas

1261
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:18,175
Cool if you're looking for my podcast you can find it

1262
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,967
It's on iTunes and all over the place

1263
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,807
Exclamation

1264
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,487
Yelling swear words that I did on your

1265
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,279
It's called shitpost

1266
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
The singer Pink

1267
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:52,223
Yeah I tried to type the word s*** into iTunes and they weren't having it so

1268
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
Motherfuker

1269
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
Pizza Luce

1270
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
I believe

1271
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,391
You are a victim of

1272
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,671
Tyranny

1273
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,463
Online censorship run-amok

1274
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,023
Undoubtedly

1275
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,119
Because you can't push it onto iTunes also just so you know

1276
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,215
Email

1277
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Podcast

1278
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,287
At gmail.com

1279
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,079
And instead I found out

1280
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,151
That that is owned by a Mexican podcast

1281
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,943
That just started

1282
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:35,999
So we just started like a couple weeks ago or in Mexico anyways

1283
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023
You don't want to talk to

1284
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,423
Local guys

1285
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,799
All the best
