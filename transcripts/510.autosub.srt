Building that

21
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Triggered a lot of those feelings that I had

22
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
Apollo

23
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008

Accelerators brutal because

26

32
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,984
And then there was

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
Busyness

00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128

Nonsense okay alright okay

36
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
On paper it doesn't work but this is one of those things where you're going to have another one

37
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
I realize all I like

38
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,208
It was the fact that these things don't happen to be before

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
There's a chance

40
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472

00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568

Terrible Irish accent

57
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
That sounds like somebody doing impression of Christopher Walken

58
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
Sex

59
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
And you're like

60
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
This is probably going to stop

61
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Keep going

62
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031

63
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
32 Irish stories in the world and there's Irish doors that go like this

64
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,575
Oh my god you're an outsider

65
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Overtime they like

66
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Okay fine

67
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
You can say but

68
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,767
You do too much so you can never leave or the other kind

69
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,143
Legos are the only two types of there's no story where they virus people growing

70
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
You're either in or out

71
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
And that's it

72
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,519
And this is very much one of those stories and then

73
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,151
Could be sold to you the way that people are going to review it is there's like a Twist at the end

74
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
There is not a twist

75
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
It's not a twist

76
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Just a reason

77
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783

83
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Episode

84
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
I think we're going to have some fun

85
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343

I'm a policy wonk

95
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
Jimmy Carter's brother

Is Yucatan

98
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
Take that generosity and you could

99
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,575
Just funnel it into some sort of creative spirit and it doesn't matter what it's a

100
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
About it doesn't matter what it's about

101
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Whether or not it's good

102
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
It's about is

103
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Getting it out there

104
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
So even if you're confused by your generous spirit

105
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Put it out there

106
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
Take me to a local bail fund

107
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,911
And I'll be goddamn if it's not better satin Ireland

108
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679

00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Bragging

116
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
There's about a half hour.

117
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,327
Beginning

118
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
Everybody

119
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Even taking off

120
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Almost every

121
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
System internet

122
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
Klowdtv is owned by Patriot

123
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
They put us on two years ago

124
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,223
We are number one on cloud TV

125
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:54,111
All News Channel together including oan or bigger than all of them Newsmax oan

126
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719

00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
YouTube

128
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,191
Dominic's too much weed. Sounds like a good reason

129
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
It's just that

130
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,711
They won't play it because we have more viewers than all of them combined on

131
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Cloudtv

132
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,319
Obviously Owen CableSystem satellite sisters and I love it

133
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
Newsmax become the number one station

134

Used to put us up at the top because we're so popular set a chance

135
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Sound like

136
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
Business logic to me for so f****** log

137
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
I was getting so annoyed that Alex was like

138
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Alpha

139
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
I'm an alpha male so when I was a kid

140
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
The album

141
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
I guess

142
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Please

143
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,303
Show me the average man or woman

144
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055

00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Trip

146
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,431

00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
The truck that's alright

150
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,671
People I don't know maybe

151
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
Maybe there are some horror movies are people intentionally

152
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
We fall down today

153
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
They're trying to get away

154
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Yeah maybe this

155
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,407
Mozzarella

156
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Anyway I I just

157
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
Who's annoying

158
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
I just needed something

159
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
Point that was going on on Wednesday show

160
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
Define

161
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,959
This is this is something disgusting

162
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
People died during Pfizer covid vaccine

163
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,943
Something else on today's episode

164
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
Want to bring this up I think

165
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
Press to cover this

166
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
Because he was like it's going to be

167
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Big Talk

168
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Sweet

169
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Particular headline

170
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Repetition

171
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
You can find the headline

172
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Covid vaccine trial

173
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
The actual article covers some of the details the story

174
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,615
Do you don't really hear them when Alex covers at on the show because he does

175
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
The story to be about

176
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,783
It's on scary that 6 people died in these trials but cases like this

177
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,623
Crucially important to consult the actual information to see what the data says

178
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,255
If you go to the fda's website you can find the vaccines and related biological products

179
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Advisory committee

180
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Document on the new Pfizer

181
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Vaccine

182
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
If you read this document

183
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
You'll find it 6 participant to the trial

184
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
But that number

185
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Has to be understood in context

186
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
The first thing to consider is that there were 43200

187
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
52 / 2

188
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Dispense enrolled in the study

189
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
6 is a very low.

190
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Number but even so

191
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
If the vaccine killed six out of 43,000 people

192
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
It still might be a cause for concern

193
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
I mean if there is 330 million people getting

194
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
If you do you'll find

195
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
And it for out of the six people who are in the placebo group

196
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
Which is to say that they didn't even get the vaccine it's being test

197
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
These deaths are absolutely

198
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
The unrelated

199
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
The vaccine

200
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Two two people

201
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Experimental

202
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Who died

203
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,343
One of them was retroactively John F Kennedy

204
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,231
These two individuals

205
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Which means if they were over 55 years of age

206
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Experience

207
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,935
Cardiac Arrest 60 days after dose 2 and 3 days later

208
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
2 months afterwards

209
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Heart attack

210
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
It's a sad for that person but almost

211
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Play unrelated to the vaccine

212
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,759
The other person experience cirrhosis and died three days after.

213
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
Arteriosclerosis is it

214
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
Absurd to imagine that a developing

215
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Free days because of

216
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
The vaccine

217
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
In this case

218
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
It seems almost certain that

219
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
Condition on relate to the vaccine

220
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Precipitate

221
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
I thought it might be possible that you

222
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
You can make a study out of whether or not

223
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,263
The vaccine could exacerbate existing cirrhosis

224
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Your concern of the authors

225
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Didn't seem like it was likely

226
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Experimental group

227
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Both are unlikely

228
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
We connected the vaccine itself

229
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,319
Misrepresented in report

230
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
I just

231
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
It seems like a

232
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,047
A very obvious oversight

233
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
6 people died in the trial

234
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
Only to receive the vaccine in the headline

235
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,055
How I meet all their Outlet

236
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
You got it

237
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
2/3

238
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
The number you're talking about exactly

239
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
But only know what how is reported

240
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,743
Of course they're standard Islam

241
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,327
Do you have paper itself

242
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
The incidence of severe adverse

243
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Adverse Events and dates

244
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
And comfortable for experimental and placebo

245
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
So

246
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
This is a disgusting lie on Alex's Park

247
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
Jesus

248
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,271
Is reading actually means

249
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,367
He gives the audience the illusion that he's informing them of important stuff

250
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
He's actually doing

251
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Misinforming

252
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,583
The flashy clickbait style headline is not necessarily untrue itself

253
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
The conclusion it's meant to leave

254
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Did you do is a lie

255
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
And I miss representation Outbacks

256
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
This

257
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
I'm not

258
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Beatnik

259
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Okay that's

260
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Something you hear about moving

261
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Going forward as

262
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
More countries

263
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
The rollout of action

264
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
I don't care

265
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
Listen to half an hour of Alex

266
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Rambling about how great he is

267
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,303
Have been this weekend

268
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
Alex is supposed to go down to DC DC

269
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
Is true

270
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
I felt like Monday

271
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Monday

272
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,783
We've got to get into like Alex going to DC and I have a little better idea of

273
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
We have a responsibility

274
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
So I was thinking

275
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
We have a responsibility to do other thing

276
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Sex

277
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Maybe now is

278
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,631
If you take DMT with your body

279
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,447
A hundred percent

280
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,079
Last week

281
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,199
Just recently Joe Rogan showed up in Alex's Studio

282
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Before our interview

283
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Just to take one

284
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
Quick-Step back it is amazing to me that they can turn

285
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
6 dead in this

286
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
Trial into a

287
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Terrifying

288
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Whenever like

289
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,751
We went from a brand

290
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
Disease

291
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Year-and-a-half

292
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
Miracle state

293
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
Miracle to have done that

294
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Adoption soup

295
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Like

296
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,159
They did it one time faster in like the 1950s like crazy hair

297
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
And they're just like all six deadline

298
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,095
Incredible

299
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,983
Severe

300
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
Severe adverse

301
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
Events

302
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Everything

303
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Stats for

304
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Number of people who I'd like

305
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,367
Arash

306
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
I agree

307
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
Issues with issues to deal with

308
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
I want to be a globalist how do I get in

309
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
So we're really doing this

310
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,431
I'm about people infinitely smarter than

311
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Save this ahead of time

312
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
Try to steer away from conversation about house

313
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
F*****-up they are

314
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Because I think

315
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
It's kind of low-hanging fruit a little bit

316
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,959
And it would become tiresome we just put a disclaimer

317
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,055
People living their lives

318
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,151
Being f***** up

319
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
Presenting himself the way he does

320
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
Eating super f***** up with Rogan

321
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Whatever

322
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
It's not as good

323
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
Alex is really true

324
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Impress

325
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,823
As much as he is just trying to like the bond between the two

326
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:29,247
The number of things I think are important

327
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
Alex's Studio isn't fun because it's like

328
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
Supplicate himself

329
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Because you are

330
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,727
Oh no

331
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,823
Figuring Alpha what we start in my list of this outside

332
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,943
Infowars the most Network in the world

333
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Well I got to tell you

334
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
I get bigger

335
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Goosebumps

336
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
For this guy on the Arizona

337
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
I've known you for 22 years

338
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,743
And you're a fun really smart amazing guy and you put a lot of my crap

339
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
I need the number one not just podcaster but

340
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
World

341
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,655
Joe Rogan Alex Jones

342
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Supplication

343
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,943
Subsequently I must have rubbed off with people if you

344
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
Consistent throughout this

345
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,999
Interview

346
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
Tell me Spotify

349
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,551
Just a couple of other like

350
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
Why'd you leave la

351
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
I really love Texas

352
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
I always was

353
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Attached to a beak

354
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Because The Comedy Store

355
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,423
Because a business and just doing stand-up

356
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
This is the logic

357
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
Excuse

358
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
The movie Ray

359
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
I just like

360
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Feasible

361
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,575
And then as soon as

362
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,391
I don't believe that for a second

363
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Almost certain

364
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951

Can I understand

367
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Perform in LA

368
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
He lived in the city

369
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,199
Protests

370
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527

The artificial

373
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,768
One fault about the best thing you could do

374
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048

Just so happens

378
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
The Texas is the state where I can most

379
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
Promise lyrics

380
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
Either Texas or move to buy

381
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
You go to Miami

382
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Sort of Steve

383
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Ask buttering

384
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
Why

385

Imagine

Is it gross

467
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,856

00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
Them to be amazing

469
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160

Couple times back when Alex was on

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,688
He lied to us about Sandy Hook

483
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,552
It was right around a lot of

484
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Attention was going on with the Sandy Hooks

485
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952

And

497
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
That's that I kind of got the whacked-out under all the pressure all the

498
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
We've been over this

499
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824

Well we just need me

502
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
It's just

503
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
It's really a microcosm of what is happening

504
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
People

505
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Talking

506
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
To each other

507
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
No it's not

508
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
It is not a microcosm of what's going on with

509
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Show Media

510
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
No.

511
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
Communicating with each other

512
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Case of

513
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
Hotels

514
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,032
Comparison

515
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,128
Remember this quote from Sinbad and I will till the day I die

516
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,272
Comics are funnier when they ride the bus

517
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
You have no

518
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,464

519
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Jeff

00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Like

521
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216
I don't know what

522
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
The f*** he thinks it's does for a living

523
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Like I don't

524
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Does he

525
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,384
Not know what Alex's

526
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,576
Conspiracies still

527
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:49,440
Possibly know the horrible things Alex said about him

528
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,656
Alex was turning their fight into contact

529
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,008
Fighting between the two of them

530
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,360
I know you probably don't have time to see

531
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
It's this whole series

532
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
The things that Joe said that Alex said directly

533
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
What's this

534
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
And remember it forever

535
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Let's save

536
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
You're a friend of mine and we have a falling out

537
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
You're a high-profile person

538
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
I would

539
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Have the instinct

540
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,352
To threaten to destroy you for attention

541
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,400
That's kind of

542
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
That's a bad person

543
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,776
Yeah if I started my own show like we have a falling-out I start my own show

544
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
All the sudden

545
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,360
You just start going on I'm going to kill jordanrants

546
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,456
Your show would become far more popular

547
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,160
Carrie's on the charade

548
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
He actually knows

549
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Anything about what

550
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
The first

551
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
Real metis

552
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,912
And that is like a full demonstration of why

553
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
When I get into issues when I'm serious

554
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,872
You can differ on my interpretation

555
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
But I'm saying I've got a clip

556
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
I got something I've got

557
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:20,576
Well that's why I wanted to clarify that in the podcast really clearly

558
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,976
You just got proven I'm surprised

559
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
Bandana

560
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,096
Raleigh was already said that was your best podcast with Joe ever

561
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
I went home depressed

562
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:37,216
This is not equipped for himself

563
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Fact check Alex

564
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
I gave just enough of the

565
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,152
Appearance of Association

566
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Destroyed his career

567
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
But you didn't help me

568
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
Get to take that shot

569
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
Because he didn't

570
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
Now that

571
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Give me correct

572
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
It's just a pathetic display

573
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,216
And here's what makes me the

574
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Most convince

575
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
To that

576
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
Home at last podcast

577
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,200
The Rockefeller Foundation

578
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
According to Alex

579
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
Easily accessed

580
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Supposed to prove it

581
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Finish the podcast

582
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,376
Mediately

583
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,400
Check that

584
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Claim

585
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
He's

586
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,336
Your friend is a liar and he's using your information

587
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
People killed

588
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
And you're complicit in it

589
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,016
If he's right there's a very easily provable conspiracy to kill off the population

590
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
Seems like

591
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
Important

592
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,696
The only thing that really makes sense is if Joe is treating Alex like

593
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:08,608
It's hard to talk to him about the crazy

594
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Ever hang out with Eddie

595
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,568
He's not going to research the fake operation

596
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
Innocent

597
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
He's doing a lot of damage

598
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Doing a bad job

599
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
To fact-check Alex

600
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,368
If you just shoot the s*** with your friend

601
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
Once you step into the game

602
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Validating his

603
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Conspiracies

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
Some kind of

605
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
Giving Alex

606
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
Basically selling your audience

607
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
You can't

608
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
I'd like the first sentence he said is just like

609
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
Can different interpretation

610
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
It's like you

611
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,736
On some things you can but there are things that are

612
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,344
It's not everything is not differentiable on interpretation

613
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
And then second

614
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
You always have the

615
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
Why why would you say that

616
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Is that the joke

617
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Pathetic

618
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:20,800
Gift for Joe

619
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Okay

620
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,664
You give me a lot of great UFC tickets but only nice to me for 20-plus years and I

621
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,992
I've never really gotten you anything I've seen people give you gifts on the show

622
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
Doing some PR thing if they're selling

623
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
I don't own any stock in this B

624
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
This is something we can go get

625
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,304
Texas

626
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
So this is your gift

627
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,936
That box of cigars

628
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,496
Cigars

629
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
It's just like a

630
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,336
Parody of masculinity.

631
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
That's really bad

632
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,064
We get it there supposedly

633
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
Yeah this is a man cave I got you alright

634
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
It's really wild

635
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:26,336
I got a bunch of them

636
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,384
How Texas is this

637
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
I was very I was very afraid

638
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
Is generally whatever

639
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Infowars

640
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Alizee

641
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:42,976
The Pinnacle of gun safety just the 2nd Amendment

642
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,816
Direct

643
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:53,216
Rifles

644
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:59,616
Get to talkin about

645
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
The medication

646
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
You know some people

647
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
Drugs

648
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
With meds

649
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
Some side effects

650
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
Different people with different side effects

651
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
You know n

652
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,232
In some people

653
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
And cocaine

654
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,584
You know there's people that say that mixing it with

655
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,472
Cocaine

656
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,800
They say don't drink on this okay

657
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
And a drink on it

658
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
Write the problem isn't

659
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
The match results

660
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
Yeah yeah that's the one

661
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,344
It's the inverse of what you think is yours

662
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,648
Let me back you up one step

663
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,720
That is what it seems

664
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
Freemasons

665
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
A valid just cuz you owe me to take this

666
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,984
Cholesterol

667
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,384
Is that really dangerous people who are all the MX

668
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,456
Use it as prescribed

669
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,832
Taking Xanax okay that's that's my Recreation

670
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,976
Estranged

671
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
A little bit

672
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,304
Because I

673
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Look cartoonish

674
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,912
Pro

675
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Marijuana

676
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:34,336
Nothing

677
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
If presented earlier on

678
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,600
It's good self move on a little bit into position where it seems like

679
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,928
Is aware that sometimes it can have negative out

680
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Comes

681
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:55,840
I've been more and more open over the last few years especially

682
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:01,472
I don't think it's a good idea to tell everybody it's always so strong that it's definitely been connected

683
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Increases in schizophrenia

684
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,592
I have no but I don't know if it's from the potency

685
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Perspective

686
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
I think maybe

687
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
It's always happened

688
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,992
We just didn't recognize

689
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
People personally

690
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,368
Normal a frozen water pot and went crazy

691
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
One of them started thinking everyone with reptiles

692
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,656
I got bad news for you

693
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,776
Employee previously normal

694
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Starting from like a really grounded places I started smoking

695
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Listening

696
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
Lost

697
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Everyone is

698
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
What's the difference between mental health

699
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,936
Is

700
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:10,080
You know what I don't I don't listen to this I don't understand why people would listen to two people have the same

701
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
Dumb thoughts you could already

702
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
We have at home

703
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,016
You know

704
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
But you can pick it up at home

705
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,184
Cuz you have knowledge and research

706
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,024
Hey I have remember the content of this thing that I might have read

707
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,608
Ultimately decided to do this episode

708
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,192
Because I'm looking forward to Monday

709
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
The script

710
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
2 BC

711
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,128
Episode

712
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,968
Motivating factor was

713
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,064
It is something serious about Mercury

714
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,464
F*** it episode unreal it's me

715
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
Long stretches where I was listening to this

716
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
I don't care I don't care

717
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Gazebo parts

718
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Just like okay

719
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,984
This is just a stupid conversation it's not really relevant

720
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Just talkin about

721
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,616
Funtime you all had or something

722
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
Joe Rogan just like 10 minutes

723
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
Like you're so much

724
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Skip

725
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,144
The time

726
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Just listen to the park

727
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Lakeside

728
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
So

729
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,688
Alex thinks what he's interviewing gioconda

730
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Tables turn

731
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,856
Dimensional things of the globalist believe and I've never ever had an inter-dimensional

732
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Here we go

733
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
Well I'm interviewing Joe Rogan

734
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,816

735
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144

And the Dodgers

737
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,336
Dimensional experience

738
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,896
Question can blow you away

739
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
If it's like

740
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Have you ever had one

741
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,488
Leaving that that's kind of probably

742
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
That's what the globalist believe

743
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,096
Experience as well

744
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,192
Make me look like an idiot just a bunch of

745
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
Police

746
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
He does say this

747
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,039
I can actually shift

748
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Into a psychic

749
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
You do at Ross

750
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Scissors

751
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:15,167
Did you not trust me

752
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
View a minute

753
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
To shift into your psychic

754
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
State

755
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,663
You better win or are they

756
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,711
I don't have to

757
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
To do any voices

758
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:37,183
Yes

759
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,279
What what that mean maybe

760
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,839
I would hope so

761
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Example

762
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,007
What you say

763
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
I wouldn't call the exaggeration

764
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Accelerated

765
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Power

766
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Where they claim

767
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Projection

768
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
Four-letter

769
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
Call wife

770
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,391
Like too much Trade Center

771
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
Watch Hamilton

772
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
What

773
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,791
Did you talk about this

774
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
So I can't really control it

775
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
Holyshit

776
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:24,287
Episode

777
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,335
Episode

778
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,711
As

779
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
Give me a recurring dream of a Guyana

780
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
And green striped sweater

781
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
Masala building

782
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,671
Club

783
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
The older kids to get alcohol

784
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
The driving downtown

785
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Dallas to get

786
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,959
Crack houses

787
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
And then

788
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
I was going around the side when these buildings it was a

789
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
A crackhead

790
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
We tried to attack me I have the exact

791
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Whole bunch of time

792
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,431
Clubbing head

793
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
Psychic

794
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,319
Too much lighter

795
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,879
Buy some weed

796
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
Ahead

797
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
A crackhead and it's the same guy from the drink

798
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
Jesus Christ

799
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,471
Wow

800
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
Holyshit

801
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
So I guess

802
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Maybe

803
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
That was like

804
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
He'd seen

805
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
Nightmare on Elm Street

806
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,967
I guess so

807
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
Your dreams unless it's a sex dream with some

808
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Interesting

809
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,463
No one cares about anything else I'm positive that I could come up with

810
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Some stories

811
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,167
Match things that happen later

812
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,799
Perfectly remember it

813
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,103
This is down to the 9/11

814
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,919
Prediction

815
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
Well that was a two-hour

816
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
July 25th

817
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
2001

818
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,999
And information

819
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Having a drink

820
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
The towers smoking

821
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
Nautica shoes

822
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,471
Here is

823
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,311
The information Source was

824
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
He is saying

825
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:39,199
I said that it was based on analysis product

826
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,991
Prophetic dreams

827
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
Frank

828
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
In 2000

829
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
Enough said

830
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:50,719
Dream about that that would be very very silly suggest

831
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
If this is all true

832
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
He's reporting this accurately

833
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,911
He was listening to a ton of Bill Cooper

834
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,495
Patriot ass radio back then

835
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Subconscious

836
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,103
Bill Cooper was saying very similar things

837
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
About it

838
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
That's

839
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,367
These feelings somebody who is this

840
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:24,767
World Trade Center

841
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
What's it about

842
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,423
The product

843
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,239
Influences that he had

844
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,519
He got on Erin pretend

845
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
You some kind of act

846
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Expert had some analysis

847
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,407
That's kind of a microcosm of his career

848
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
He has information that he's just

849
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
He's ever said the

850
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,183
That he predicted 9/11 as like a result

851
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
So

852
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Then

853
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:06,495
If you could unless you are psychic

854
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,343
How seriously should you take any information that he provides

855
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
If he was willing

856
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
To Passover predict

857
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Attack

858
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
Hazard analysis when it was actually a dream

859
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
That sounds about right

860
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
Is an interview

861
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
Find out what the

862
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
The truth is

863
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,407
Unless Joe doesn't want to have

864
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,527
OLX

865
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
This is so forced

866
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:58,207
Look I mean

867
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Because I actually

868
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
I can talk plenty

869
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Lookout

870
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,839
No I know right

871
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:09,727
If you were magically made world

872
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
You would do to change the world as it is

873
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,103
Alex Jones ever does this I'm not being different

874
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
I understand

875
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,991
I don't think the two of them

876
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
I want to kind of

877
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,367
Something

878
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,903
Conversation

879
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
More

880
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
Charismatic

881
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,559
Yeah I mean I just I thought I would

882
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
Every now and again

883
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
Okay

884
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
Okay

885
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
Things the same time like

886
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Can I watch it

887
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Could probably

888
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Hangout with Rogan

889
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407
Wow

890
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
We get along with him

891
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
Get into these sorts

892
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,039
The topic

893
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
It wasn't like

894
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,367
A show

895
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:03,231
I wouldn't want to be on his show conversation

896
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:09,375
Social conversations in green rooms

897
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,567
You're forcing it

898
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
Comedy

899
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,455
Navigation at least he's willing to have

900
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:27,551
No conversation that's not true

901
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,623
Hundred percent

902
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,743
How about this kill f***** fight

903
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
I don't want to kill him

904
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,711
That man you just making a mockery of it do you want personal mama

905
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,623
So desperate now that

906
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,207
Meme that's really bad

907
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:14,399
Especially since he's he's trying to get seems like he's getting so much mileage out of just saying

908
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
F***

909
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
Just like kill sucks

910
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
It's like ice like a family

911
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
Question

912
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,871
You want Grandma to say piss

913
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
We know it

914
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
Yeah a little bit of

915
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
The problem to Annette Lake

916
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,527
Joe doesn't seem to hate Bill Gates whereas Alex

917
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:38,207
Claims to know that he runs the world and wants to kill everyone and Alex

918
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
Hatred of Bill Gates

919
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Which seems weird

920
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Considering

921
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,911
Everything

922
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
I would have said

923
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
You know

924
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
He's one of the 12

925
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,359
Maybe your baby

926
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:02,015
When I when I was cast last

927
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,831
There were just tons and tons

928
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,135
The things that were inaccurate

929
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,951
Emotionally

930
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:14,303
After manipulative at the very least yes

931
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,095
Episode

932
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,679
Catalog

933
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,727
But Joe seems to think

934
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
People were desperate

935
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,567
To find something that

936
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:31,455
Let's go ahead and Play Bill Gates himself saying that the vaccine made 80% of

937
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,783
The people

938
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,879
And people are complaining and trying to find

939
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
Something that you said that was

940
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,975
Beatley check

941
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
Everything you said in all black

942
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
Accurate

943
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
Then we got to this part where you said

944
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
80% of people that took the vaccine got sick

945
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,935
And people like he's spreading

946
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
Anti-vaccine

947
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
See theories

948
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Just okay listen

949
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,055
Here's a video

950
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,151
We're not desperate to find things that Alex was wrong about

951
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
No

952
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,807
Google Search honest Lake Austin

953
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:12,671
Exhausting

954
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,207
For f****** ever

955
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,559
I don't understand

956
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
We can possibly not wreck

957
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:24,191
Advise that Alex was blocked

958
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,983
He's like so glaring

959
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
You should never talk to Alex ever again

960
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
But

961
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,103
He seems to think that everybody was so good

962
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
Desperate to find one

963
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:39,039
One place where Alex didn't. His dad or crosses T see this this is a struggle because

964
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,623
It does seem like he doesn't take Alex seriously

965
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
How can you

966
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
You also say that

967
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
You know that's the complicated

968
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,559
Like he doesn't take

969
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,143
This information seriously

970
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,959
Proven and then not really like

971
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:04,895
Nationalize Alex

972
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
Not taking a step in

973
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
F****** conspiracy

974
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
Plan to destroy everyone in

975
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575

979
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
If you're willing

980
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,607
Could you believe that stuff has

981
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Proven

982
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
And not use

983
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,751
Five of your hundred million dollars to do something about it

984
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,823
Yours even if you believe without

985
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,383
The elites are killing all of us

986
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,783
Marinas all and you have 100 million dollars by Infowars something about it

987
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
Make that

988
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415

00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,727
Doesn't

992
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:04,031
Play publicly is to be like

993
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Yeah everyone's just mad about

994
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
Things that you say because

995
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
Cuz you're saying

996
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,919
They're too attached

997
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
The messenger

998
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
People get

999
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
Into the messenger

1000
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,855
They get trapped into the messenger instead of listening to the information

1001
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Moron

1002
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,695
Might have something important to say

1003
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
You never know

1004
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
When someone

1005
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,047
Is integrity

1006
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
Who was an idiot

1007
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,911
Most things and they come to you with one fax

1008
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
Did they saw on TV

00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,079
Get the f*** out of here

1010
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,407
Wolf comes from absolute

1011
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:46,015
You just reference

1012
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,831
I'm supposed to be in a story is it when you

1013
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,391

1015
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
Believing

1016
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,239
Bizarre interpretation of that story

1017
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:10,335
Queen supposed to be that if you're a liar and the lies you tell

1018
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,383
You can cause serious damage

1019
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
They might not believe you

1020
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:22,111
Altus

1021
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
Just continuing to lie

1022
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,767
Particularly

1023
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
People in town there's an issue there

1024
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,607
Critically important

1025
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
Joey singing people cannot

1026
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,983
Hear the things Alex says and if

1027
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Because they're caught up

1028
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
The messenger

1029
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
They hate Alex

1030
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,847
So he must be wrong

1031
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,895
This is exactly the

1032
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,479
Engages with Alex just in the reverse

1033
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Jones complete

1034
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:54,111
We caught up on the messenger and refuses to accept

1035
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,135
Malignant narcissist

1036
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
Who is not his

1037
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,231
More than most people

1038
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,047
I can easily separate my feelings but how repulsive

1039
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,583
From whether or not specific

1040
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Claimed

1041
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
Based in reality

1042
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,423
It's not a difficult exercise

1043
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
Because I care

1044
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
Because I believe that there's a

1045
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,007
Matter

1046
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,823
Talk about ideas

1047
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
Bad ideas

1048
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,895
He doesn't

1049
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Any of this s***

1050
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
He's talking about matters

1051
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,479
He's trapped

1052
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,951
He only believes because the two of them has gotten sucked up together a couple times and said offensive things to each other

1053
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,791
I guess

1054
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,095
I challenged to take his own

1055
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Advice

1056
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,655
And separate the messenger from the message

1057
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,215
Start with operation lockstep

1058
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,775
From there and consider the possibility that this person

1059
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
Sisters your friend

1060
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,591
Is actually the dangerous liar

1061
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Yeah I do

1062
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
I mean

1063
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:56,319
Okay then do you watch like the other concern

1064
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,135
Well obviously I must believe them because it's true

1065
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
That's the only

1066
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,463
Because they're not the F no

1067
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,047

1069
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,119
Defend Alex no matter what

1070
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:17,055
Kind of sucks but it really Gaslight people

1071
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
Disagree

1072
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
Possibly have substance

1073
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
Space

00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
Your feelings it's always

1076
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
You creating this

1077
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,623
Who's coming from

1078
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,207
JW snowflake because Alex Jones

1079
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,511
To Manley or something

1080
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,071
Boring

1081
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,119
Dyke trafficking

1082
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,471
In this like fetishization of ideas and that's the idea you have

1083
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,567
500 something episode to this park has the rice up

1084
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,871

1085
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
It's not I don't

1086
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,247
Stop 20 long time

1087
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
Bulshit Joe

1088
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
It's just like

1089
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,671
Alex's fears of and then

1090
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,487
Being like on the other side and he wants those things to happen

1091
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
What he's afraid of his

1092
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
The things that you desire

1093
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:14,143
In the same way Joe is what is really expressing is

1094
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,447
Things based on how I feel

1095
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,567
That others react to Things based on how they feel

1096
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
I can't imagine

1097
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,711
Breaking Free of the the molds that I exist in because obviously

1098
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,503
If I have 100 million dollars

1099
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
The things I see

1100
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,063
Think are important

1101
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
Feelings that I have

1102
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Or f******

1103
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:39,743
Fake prophetic ass dreams that I have that must be criticism comes from as well

1104
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,815
Yeah it gets into this

1105
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
This kind of thing a little bit

1106
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
It's really rather

1107
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
This clip here

1108
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,079
Cuz he's talking about like how people shake their ideas

1109
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
This might be how he

1110
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,407
Has

1111
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
Or

1112
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
It feels like projector

1113
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,015
This is the thing is like

1114
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,807
Allowed to have

1115
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
The other ideas

1116
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,391
The whole idea

1117
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,695
Of who you are and what life is

1118
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,231
Is mostly shaped

1119
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,023
By what you think is going to

1120
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,863
Delete resistance from the people around you

1121
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Was

1122
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,703
The fact they were open and free believing speech

1123
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:24,031
Demonologist

1124
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,847
I'm so high out of you.

1125
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
You said some really smart

1126
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,199
Tigrett

1127
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,527
Discount

1128
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,319
Because he's all

1129
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,159
Presumption

1130
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,231
You mold your identity by was that witch

1131
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,095
These ideas that will cause the least the people around you

1132
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
That's not

1133
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,287
Xperia X your personality

1134
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
New people

1135
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
Better because

1136
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
Yeah

1137
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
I can't handle

1138
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,647
This

1139
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,951
There's ideas and

1140
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:18,559
You can look at things from a different way but we also have to exist in a world where something

1141
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
And some things are not

1142
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Everything

1143
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
Is not open to interpretation

1144
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,983
It just can't be otherwise

1145
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,263
We get places where it's like

1146
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,311
We think there's voter fraud so there was

1147
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
No

1148
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,431
At their end of certain point something is or is not we can't live in

1149
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
And no this is just how I am

1150
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
Interpret things

1151
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,063
Like that's just not how we can share a universe yeah

1152
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:51,327
Completely different people

1153
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,399
Four different people

1154
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447

I voted for the libertarian

1157
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,335
We should probably

1158
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,687
Third-party candidate

1159
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,479
Cuz that's one of the solutions

1160
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,551
I'd love to grill him on Jorgensen

1161
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:21,279
I guess it doesn't really matter since it's California

1162
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,863
I would love to see how much

1163
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,935

1188
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
No not remember

1189
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:02,143
I was worried about

1190
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,543
Smiles and loves

1191
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
Cuz he starts

1192
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
Thinking about how

1193
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
Psychologist

1194
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,687
So say like

1195
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
What you think of

1196
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,575
Isn't always

1197
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:25,183
Happier

1198
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
Microcosm

1199
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,863
His relationship to animals as relationship to people

1200
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,911
I don't understand why you don't take me

1201
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,447
You're all

1202
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,263
You're all nature none of us nurture

1203
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,127
They are up here though they have soul

1204
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
They have mined

1205
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
They have decisions just you don't

1206
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,783
The elite

1207
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,367
Ultimate therealreal he'll run in the lower class

1208
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,671
Elitism what existed before the German

1209
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,719
And then in modern Psychiatry and psychology

1210
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,255
200 years ago

1211
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,559
That's what I'm coming at here is it doesn't mean that

1212
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
Things a predator

1213
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
Real human trait

1214
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,983
Coulter Gill blocking us from a larger issue because

1215
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
Your dog is Magic

1216
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,543
Your dog does have a soul

1217
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,823
It does have an energy

1218
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,359
It is smiling

1219
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,639
You are interfacing

1220
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,199
Dogs are psychic buffers way more cycling we are

1221
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,247
That's why I'm saying is your dog

1222
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:25,855
Is his example of what Humanity to go towards instead of somebody like Bill Gates

1223
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:30,207
We should be less like Jesus

1224
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:36,863
It's meaningful. Just scream out I don't want to learn

1225
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,215
How do they say something different than me

1226
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,799
Someone telling me that my

1227
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
My cat smiling doesn't

1228
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,431
I mean she's happy what does it what does it mean question

1229
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,015
Purring isn't always like showing

1230
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,343
Love or happiness how can I make it better

1231
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,391
Am I also don't question

1232
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
The

1233
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,951
Bonds that we have

1234
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
I'm not tied up in

1235
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,071
If a psychiatrist said that the cat doesn't feel ever

1236
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
Everything you think

1237
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
It's feeling all the time that's because

1238
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,679
I'm not interested

1239
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,215
Projecting my feelings

1240
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
Pet friend

1241
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,591
I don't understand why people

1242
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,663
I don't know I don't care

1243
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,783
So far

1244
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
About the idea that

1245
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
People have valid

1246
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
Good criticism

1247
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,463
In this next clip I think this is black ice

1248
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,815
Listen Alex you got to think of what it's like to be a 20 year old

1249
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,607
Who is friends with

1250
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,399
The bunch of other twenty-three-year-old

1251
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,191
Kids and a spouse of

1252
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
Rigid

1253
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,031
And with someone

1254
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,055
Besides Urology

1255
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,591
Audiology says maybe

1256
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
The guy's not a bad guy maybe

1257
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:56,223
Like a psychotic moment maybe had a bad time

1258
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,271
Maybe he believed it because he see

1259
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
Being so much

1260
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,879
Said he seen so many lies

1261
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,695
Crazy

1262
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
Crazy cuz he's on his own

1263
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,279
Because nobody

1264
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,071
What's the stand up and say

1265
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,375
Hey he's right about a lot of s***

1266
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
Bastille

1267
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,495
Psychotic

1268
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,079
What Joe is presenting

1269
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
This idea

1270
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,663
The only people who are really

1271
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,711
Critiquing Alex or 23

1272
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,503
He rolled socially

1273
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
Uncomfortable with

1274
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:35,135
That they have of saying hey maybe Alex is right about something

1275
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:36,671
Ridiculous

1276
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,743
Yeah that's very frustrating end

1277
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,071
Almost suggest a a sort of

1278
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
Distance from

1279
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
People really live

1280
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,447
They could only really come about

1281
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,287
Billion dollars

1282
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:59,455
This is why because all their 23

1283
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:03,039
Year old friends are in 1/8

1284
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:09,439
Crazy how

1285
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
Actually

1286
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
Twenty-three-year-old

1287
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
Men

1288
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,863
Who are afeared

1289
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
It's all those

1290
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,471
Non Alpha men

1291
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,567
Carrying a gun right now

1292
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
People don't

1293
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
Expect everything

1294
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,663
We Believe without questioning us

1295
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,967
And a real problem

1296
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:38,111
Is there a like Scott left out in the wilderness

1297
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Problem

1298
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,439
You can if you're wrong rather about something

1299
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:47,583
I'm a human being and your perspective is valuable and one of the reasons why you were wrong about this

1300
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Mustangs

1301
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
Is because you were abandoned

1302
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
It was so many people that didn't

1303
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,495
Hitch sarkar

1304
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
Do your train

1305
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
Is there a scare

1306
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,335
11

1307
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,383
Conspiracy in the Bohemian Grove

1308
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Conspiracy

1309
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,455
And the f****** Bilderberg conspiracy

1310
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,783
It was so many different things that led people down on comp

1311
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,343
Uncomfortable conversations

1312
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
Didn't want to be a part of it

1313
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,671
Who just left you alone

1314
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
And

1315
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
When people

1316
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
Get

1317
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
Band

1318
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,839
All of the other people around them

1319
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,375
Possibly

1320
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Haven't

1321
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
You're correct

1322
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,215
You start going

1323
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
Is it okay okay

1324
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,551
We've all seen Good Will Hunting

1325
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Speaker

1326
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
But you ain't that was

1327

That was f****** Matt Damon as like I under pressure

1328
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,719
This is like giving that same

1329

Pep talks to John Wayne Gacy and be like look a lot of people just don't understand why you're

1330
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
You're doing what you're doing

1331
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,703
But they're just not ready to challenge themselves

1332
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,007
I disagree here's what I think

1333
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,543
Be like

1334
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,615
Haven't killed all those people

1335
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
I meant someone

1336
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
His friend look

1337
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
You know

1338
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,247
Problem was

1339
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,599
You didn't have friends around you telling you not to dress up like clowns

1340
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,439
Define

1341
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:28,959
I don't know deposition of Paul Joseph Watson

1342
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,127
Bad thing he's done in his career

1343
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:42,527
These are the people bitching about participation trophy

1344
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,319
The most likes Hey look

1345
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:50,719
Just cuz you failed a million times upwards to the tune of millions of dollars doesn't mean you're not still great

1346
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,815
Its participation trophies and personal responsibility

1347
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,631
And ideas like these people

1348
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,959
They keep repeating it over and over and over again

1349
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:04,287
And here you have like Alex it's not your fault people just left you

1350
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:10,943
That's why you had to say

1351
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:16,063
I think a lot of people's criticisms

1352
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
Entitled

1353
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,159
Man

1354
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,743
23 year old is worried about the bead that goes around

1355
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,023
Could be that you're right

1356
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
So

1357
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,839
You are

1358
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,703
Hearing something like Alex

1359
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,727
Exposure

1360
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
How do you how would you hear that

1361
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,567
Like a punch to the

1362
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:43,455
I'm not using you as interview but you're so big in the system

1363
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
What's a watch

1364
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
You're doing

1365
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,575
Get messages through when you're on the show

1366
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,135
So one of the things I want to say to the left is

1367
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,463
The left the average one person left

1368
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Cool

1369
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,559
I hear Alex say

1370
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,839
I'm not using you

1371
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,703
People will listen because you're here as

1372
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,239
I'm using you right now

1373
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
Understand

1374
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,359
How you could be friends with Alex for this long

1375
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
Without

1376
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Finding out who

1377
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,455
Is rhetorical trick

1378
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
And then doing the thing

1379
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,551
Literally

1380
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
He does that every

1381
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,903
Alex's son name to show I'm not bragging

1382
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,463
Exactly

1383
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,791
I'm not doing this I'm not using you

1384
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,607
I'm using you

1385
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:39,007
Everyone I don't hang out with him real life only on the context of this show

1386
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,799
Occasionally

1387
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,871
And I picked up on that real fast

1388
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,175
And just because it's like

1389
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
I think it's

1390
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,735
Kind of indicative

1391
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,807
Some stretches of this episode where it's like

1392
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
Caribou

1393
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,327
You ever have Kopi Luwak

1394
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,095
Coffee

1395
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,399
Oh my God

1396
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,727
That's why I'm a Razorback though

1397
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,007
Kopi Luwak

1398
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:11,775
Coffee

1399
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,823
Is coffee that comes from a civet

1400
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,919
Isa Coffeebar crapser

1401
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,455
And then people collect

1402
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,735
And clean them up

1403
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,015
Selam

1404
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
Anna makes the best

1405
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,111
Coffee

1406
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
It's so good

1407
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,975
It's really good

1408
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
Like its

1409
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
It's a cat

1410
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,119
I guess if it is kind of a cat is like

1411
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,199
That was trying to stalk you

1412
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,503
But I want to show a lot

1413
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,807
Hey you got

1414
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
Don't catch tell Joe you.

1415
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
This weekend

1416
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,279
Yeah

1417
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
That animal shoots out

1418
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
Coffee beans

1419
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
And then

1420
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,167
Super expensive

1421
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Expensive

1422
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
It's called Copa

1423
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,519
Yeah

1424
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
It's really good

1425
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,639
Wow

1426
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:26,015
Great I've been on road trip

1427
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:26,783
And there is one

1428
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,319
I will remember forever

1429
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
Because

1430
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:33,951
The two people in the back just started having such a boring conversation while I was driving

1431
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
I drove so much

1432
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,815
Faster cuz their conversation was

1433
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,143
That is the worst

1434
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
Stop being friends

1435
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,263
With people who had that conversation

1436
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
I just sort of

1437
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,871
Is a couple

1438
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,919
That was one of them

1439
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
Temples

1440
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,015
Don't know what's going on

1441
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:02,879
Did This Is Us on purpose is going to stop

1442
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,183
You can edit

1443
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:09,023
Message

1444
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,559
Get across on this episode

1445
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
We need to get rid of tribalism

1446
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
Get over that

1447
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,127
And start looking at each other ideas

1448
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,599
Here is I would like people to stop criticizing rich white man

1449
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Maybe

1450
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
That could be a

1451
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
Dealing

1452
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,439
With the remnant

1453
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,743
Of a Savage path

1454
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,279
People kill people

1455
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,303
With stone

1456
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,351
Axe tools

1457
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,167
Now we deal with Kimbrell's nothing

1458
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,495
My point is

1459
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,823
We're connected with this idea

1460
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,663
Absolutely have to

1461
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,551
In opposition with each other

1462
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,087
It's nonsense

1463
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:05,855
That's the way

1464
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,903
Weaknesses not

1465
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,463
Like flip-flopping or

1466
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,999
Considering your opinion

1467
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
The real

1468
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,303
Is

1469
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,583
The really thinking

1470
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,863
People that

1471
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,143
March

1472
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
Different

1473
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
The way they look at

1474
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
Thanks

1475
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,543
Those people are your enemy

1476
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,847
That's what I want

1477
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,663
Do you know who you're talkin

1478
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
Imaginary enemies

1479
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
Looking for the literal devil

1480
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,367
Just like this

1481
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
He's a fine

1482
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,207
Farcical to be making it

1483
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
While sitting next

1484
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
Alex

1485
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Jones

1486
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,839
You know what you should do after this you should ask

1487
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,119
What he thinks about

1488
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:49,887
Kratz

1489
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,775
Literally

1490
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103
Wow

1491
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,151
Call my God

1492
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:06,015
It's a it's a flying saucer

1493
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
Would like that

1494
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,343
Tubi

1495
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Perfect world

1496
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
And it can only

1497
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,743
Only come about in an all-white Nation it seems like that's kind

1498
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,303
Volvo dealer

1499
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
Yeah

1500
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,935
Parts that he kind of

1501
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
Focuses on

1502
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,519
Maybe those tribalism parts of the worst ones

1503
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Now we start

1504
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:32,127
We have to overcome it though

1505
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
I think

1506
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,527
The thing that is

1507
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
Mos Def

1508
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,599
Difficult to overcome

1509
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
For the understanding

1510
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,975
The reality of the universe

1511
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:50,815
White male havior

1512
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,887
In opposition to you

1513
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,935
Switch a righteous and true and good

1514
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:59,007
But if I don't have problem with somebody can overtake me

1515
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,311
I don't like read Elizabeth

1516
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
Like I don't want a government

1517
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,127
Government

1518
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,151
Limited government

1519
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,687
Protect me from

1520
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,711
Right

1521
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
I think maybe

1522
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
The solution is an understanding of tribalism

1523
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,879
And then an agreement

1524
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
Animal people

1525
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
It should look at those

1526
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,095
Good versus bad

1527
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,887
Positive versus Sin

1528
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,215
Local christian cosmology

1529
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,263
What is a sin against humanity

1530
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,079
I think being a chickenshit

1531
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,151
Coward

1532
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,575
Sins Against Humanity

1533
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,111
To listen to

1534
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,391
Dumber people

1535
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
Have a conversation

1536
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:53,279
That was famous for happening 2,500 years ago

1537
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:01,471
What does it say this is the problem with so much like on

1538
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,775
Course

1539
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
Debate

1540
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,943
People who are self-taught

1541
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,783
Realized

1542
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,575
You think are so revolutionary

1543
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,855
You might encounter

1544
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,135
Your first year in college

1545
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,487
These points

1546
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Blown

1547
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,559
Also I mean like

1548
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
As a

1549
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,887
Good faith actors

1550
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,191
Okay now this is interesting

1551
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:40,383
Very call Joe are on the right track buddy

1552
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,991
Tribal

1553
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
And then

1554
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
If people

1555
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,831
We get two extra boom

1556
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,903
Look at a B.

1557
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:56,511
How is society organized in Italy

1558
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,559
Give people up

1559
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,983
Larger than 1,000 we have to have a fine for being

1560
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,263
Foolish

1561
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:17,247
Forcible in any way

1562
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,551
Absolute

1563
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,391
Use out population

1564
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:27,743
But they don't think about that cuz they've never been the vulnerable population getting cracked out

1565
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,423
Here's what I used to think

1566
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,263
Blown away by this very conversation

1567
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,871
What's the reason I thought people who spent their entire life studying this type of thing

1568
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,199
Having a conversation in that becoming popular

1569
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,759
That for me I thought

1570
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,295
Was that it would be too dry

1571
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,111
Boring

1572
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,927
This conversation is more boring than anything I can

1573
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
Chicken takeout

1574
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,535
This Is tragically boring and multiple going to watch that

1575
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,863
Further Tire life study

1576
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,655
Yeah I had I have

1577
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
I don't know

1578
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,495
It's not for me to say because I guess I'm not a normal person

1579
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
Necessarily

1580
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,055
Channel 36

1581
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:18,176
Different. Of my life is maybe the Target demographic of you

1582
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
But like

1583
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
I think a lot

1584
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,904
Think of like college lecturers

1585
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,464
Academic conversation to be really boring

1586
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:34,560
This is f****** boring

1587
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,584
The differences

1588
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
If you engage with the academic stuff

1589
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,960
You probably work something

1590
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,824
Alex

1591
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
Because

1592
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:50,176
Just talkin about this need to overcome

1593
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,064
I think there's a sense of

1594
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
You don't get it

1595
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,136
You don't get the higher-level.

1596
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:05,536
Things that I'm imagining imagining is stupid

1597
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
PDS

1598
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:11,680
World

1599
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,216
And it's disappointing to me

1600
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,240
Yeah

1601
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
Despite all that disappointment

1602
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,872
And we can prove it

1603
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,480
Glenn Rashad a video during the contested election

1604
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:29,600
Dressed up I dress up like

1605
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,464
In a wheelchair

1606
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,048
Wet running around

1607
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
Was Apple

1608
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:39,840
The capital

1609
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
And we smoke

1610
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,936
Every single time these to talk

1611
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,752
It's story comes up

1612
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:50,848
Maybe there aren't that many memories suggest

1613
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,944
They got high and ran around the Capitol and masks

1614
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,480
You know I think

1615
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
That the basis

1616
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,088
Like the stories for any friendship

1617
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:04,416
Should not be I guess you had to be there stories

1618
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
You know

1619
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,232
This story is one where I'm like

1620
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,584
Maybe if I was there would be funny but this is

1621
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:17,472
I've seen it

1622
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,128
How much fun

1623
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,712
It was like in a 99-2000 it's just your

1624
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
Free

1625
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,784
You know like such a different time

1626
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,088
Grunge

1627
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:38,720
Maybe a few years I just think it's kind of depressing

1628
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,584
People who only have one story

1629
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,352
Every time

1630
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:46,912
Gaston song that story comes up

1631
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,728
Yeah

1632
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
Read it again

1633
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,384
Another thing

1634
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
Mentality that Alex has

1635
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,784
Being like

1636
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,832
Rogan with this like

1637
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,856
Get rid of all this

1638
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,952
Nearby

1639
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,744
I don't have a hundred million dollars

1640
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,280
This is this is Alec

1641
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,816
Expressing

1642
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,144
You know his nationalism is basically a cult

1643
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,216
Because he mad

1644
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,008
Enemies are also called

1645
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
But I guess

1646
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,640
Creating my own enemy

1647
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,432
Destroy myself

1648
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,992
I don't understand what you don't understand

1649
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:36,576
I'm creating my own enemy to justify really f***** up

1650
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,928
We have 20 nationalism which is failed

1651
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
Is Colton

1652
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
But

1653
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,536
Humans organized and called

1654
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,328
Our nature

1655
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,608
You're at that point Joe

1656
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
I can see up on the mountain

1657
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,424
Get where you're going

1658
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,704
I'm just saying

1659
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,984
We are at a crisis though

1660
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,032
It is

1661
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,056
The Nationals called

1662
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
A free market

1663
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:02,432
Money and family a God and guns and everything's going to counter the chai cam

1664
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:06,016
Where man you are taking hours a day do you complain your ass is dead

1665
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,320
Because the global model is kind of China

1666
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,880
And honesty is there taking off

1667
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,536
First of all

1668
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Whenever

1669
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,096
You're in a situation

1670
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,632
Where are your coming to me

1671
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,704
For Global advice

1672
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,752
We got real problems

1673
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,544
I think there's a human

1674
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,360
I appreciate that

1675
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,688
F*** are you at

1676
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,480
Unfortunately

1677
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:40,320
He does continue and give an idea of how

1678
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,600
You should have stopped

1679
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,392
You shouldn't ask me

1680
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,208
Honestly I do

1681
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,232
Looking ugly

1682
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,864
Wave a magic wand

1683
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,424
Mega Mall do mushroom

1684
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,496
Cuz all of them

1685
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,776
Everybody

1686
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:03,872
Anybody in a position of power anybody walked into an ideology

1687
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
Anybody

1688
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,664
Nonsense

1689
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,688
Anybody who

1690
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
Leave things

1691
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,248
They know

1692
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,552
Truly Queen

1693
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:14,112
Fight for them to know people that know

1694
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,696
Bolivar true how dare you

1695
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:19,744
This

1696
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,584
Weird f****** Dario people

1697
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
Pigeons

1698
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
But

1699
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,168
But then, go crazy, go crazy

1700
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
Yeah

1701
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:33,824
Kids break the law

1702
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,944
Millwright

1703
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
Or something

1704
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
This is

1705
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
I mean

1706
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,600
This is embarrassing at spectacular

1707
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,368
Opens like 50

1708
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:55,840
Switches

1709
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,400
To learn and really condensed

1710
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,936
Sit still further down

1711
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:05,056
Fungus

1712
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
Israel-palestine

1713
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,408
Breathe

1714
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,480
Is bran

1715
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:15,040
Really, he's just doing this

1716
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:18,624
Play imagine if your job is to essentially be high all the time

1717
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,160

1829
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920
Here's what I would say

1830
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,832
Did you have a responsibility to not allowed to talk about anything

1831
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,392
Conspiracy related anything political

1832
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:49,792
If your goal was just to talk about

1833
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,096
Talk about college

1834
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,888
High School

1835
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
Slick talk about that stuff

1836
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,472
You do not talk about the globalist

1837
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,008
You don't talk about it

1838
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
Because

1839
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,336

1840
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,104

You can always go back to and say Hey look

1843
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,248
We had him on our show and

1844
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,528
He checked out

1845
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:15,392
If you think something's wrong I'll tell you when I looked at

1846
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,672
Case of water

1847

1852
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,752
You can't pretend that you're fact-checking him

1853
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
How do you spawn

1854
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,312
Cuz you're doing me a

1855
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:39,968
It's almost as though he grew up kind of choosing the path of least resistance

1856
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:46,880
Get along with everybody around him and just kind of

1857
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,720
So I will say

1858
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
Comfortable

1859
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768

Disrespected

01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,056
He is uncomfortable and he should be

1879
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
Be comfortable with that

1880
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,896
Interviews

1881
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664

01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,064
So what are the things that I think

1888
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,600
Big point that I made early on

1889
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,416
Podcast

1890
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:27,232
Get life now cuz I still like him nearly as much as

1891
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,840
I used to dislike him more

1892
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,728
I still do believe

1893
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
But I think

1894
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,776
Probably less important

1895
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,104
He used to fill

1896
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872

1897
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,176
Good role in society

1898
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,456
The kind of guy

1899
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,992
Who will freak you out

1900
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
And maybe

1901
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,040
Brothers

1902
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:56,160
Friend or something who tells you about the CIA or whatever

1903
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,208
He's a voice that there is

1904
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,000
Place for in society

1905
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
Conspiracy theorist

1906
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,328
You know.

1907
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,120
Behave the way that Alex does

1908
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,656
The guy who's not also

1909
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,448
Complete racist

1910
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,496
Big

1911
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,776
Throwing around

1912
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,568
Demon s*** all the time

1913
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,872
Without malice

1914
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,152
Yeah

1915
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,712
Is a place for that I think Joe

1916
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,504
He touches on

1917
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,296
Why

1918
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,576
Alex

1919
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,112
Has anything

1920
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,904
Because there was a place

1921
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
Youfit in

1922
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,976
You taught me a lot of things

1923
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,816
Like I said earlier

1924
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352
About

1925
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,632
People using

1926
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,496
Departments or other

1927
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,056
Law enforcement or whatever

1928
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,080
To start

1929
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
Smashing

1930
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,664
Polite protest

1931
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,944
Violent protests

1932
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,272
Like until you showed me last stop at agent provocateur

1933
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:57,344
I really had no idea that anybody would ever sink like that

1934
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
I had this naive

1935
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,392
Perspective

1936
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,672
The thing a lot of people have

1937
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,464
People that are in

1938
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,000
Government

1939
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,024
People that are real

1940
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,328
Leadership

1941
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,120
They really just want the best

1942
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,400
For the citizens

1943
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,424
Superior

1944
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,288
Discussing these kinds

1945
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,712
YouTube

1946
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,992
Fortunately

1947
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,040
The double-edged

1948
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,904
It's so clearly demonstrates

1949
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,184
But yes

1950
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,464
In the 90s

1951
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
Alex

1952
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,792
Did the idea of agent

1953
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,096
Snitch

1954
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,632
Right

1955
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,496
And ended up

1956
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,520
Being a guy who

1957
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,080
Can shift into psychic spaces

1958
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,872
His lawyer is a little to cop

1959
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,456
Located now his skill set

1960
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:59,808
He's a show that went on too long he's ending the Game of Thrones

1961
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,856
Success

1962
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,184
The reason

1963
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,000
He got like millions of dollars and ended up at 9

1964
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
Pretty

1965
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,448
Successful

1966
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,496
Making a good living

1967
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:21,824
Being a conspiracy theory talk show host

1968
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:28,736
But you got to

1969
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:29,760
Being like

1970
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,064
Famous I've always just wanted

1971
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,880
What is life is like a comic like I want to live

1972
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,416
Comic live I don't want

1973
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:39,488
Millions Auto 100000000 enough

1974
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:41,792
Too much

1975
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,072
End up being

1976
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
To do

1977
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
Whatever it is you need

1978
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,008
Because once you start going down there

1979
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:57,408
When you start worrying about pill sales you start to think about like what are the things that I'm doing

1980
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,968
Gets the most attention.

1981
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
And then

1982
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:06,368
You know it's no longer hey here's a boring conversation but the reality of Aging

1983
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
Provocateur

1984
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:11,488
And what you need to know about the history of this tactic right

1985
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,768
Becomes everybody

1986
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,584
Pretend

1987
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,168
Because it's exciting

1988
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
Because you're

1989
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
To educate

1990
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:26,080
Or whatever

1991
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
It's

1992
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,152
Now marketing

1993
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,968
That's it

1994
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,272
The idea of

1995
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:38,880
Not trying to be a millionaire in doing every single possible step you can take

1996
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648
To get there

1997
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,928
Is a

1998
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,464
Radical socialist,

1999
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,280
Bulshit Dan and you're on my list

2000
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,584
Where is Alex

2001
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,424
Years ago turn Joe on

2002
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Interior

2003
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,520
This is what he does now

2004
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,848
I'm in Arizona 3 weeks ago I got a call from the White House

2005
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,944
Mommy

2006
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
Sun

2007
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:10,112
Do you need to look into

2008
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,976
Dominion and communist China and Switzerland also

2009
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,768
Call this guy

2010
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,048
This guy calls me up

2011
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,352
Company

2012
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,400
That's why I probably look at it

2013
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:25,728
We get all the SEC documents running boards all the news today

2014
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,104
Why are you telling me this

2015
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,896
Michelle's of you as a conduit

2016
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,176
I'm almost like is that

2017
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:34,944
Describe

2018
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,992
Is a setup

2019
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,808
It's about something like they can do that with someone

2020
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:44,672
Qanon

2021
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,208
Twitter accounts and stuff

2022
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,000
Conspiracy that

2023
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:48,768
He laundered

2024
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,144
Are they doing this to discredit me

2025
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
Yeah

2026
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,960
That moment of self-reflection

2027
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:00,544
Action was very strange

2028
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,824
You forgot that you said

2029
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,896
Becky was your score

2030
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,432
Sensitive

2031
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,968
I think that they're trying to

2032
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
To discredit

2033
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:14,880
Lying and telling these intriguing stories to joke to keep his attention

2034
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,928
What is a what's the percentage of people

2035
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,768
Uses about 60% of the national election

2036
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,304
49%

2037
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,840
You're off your election

2038
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:31,776
The whole metric with Trump they had a overturned about

2039
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,080
90

2040
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:40,224
99%

2041
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,368
Do you know that for a fact

2042
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:50,208
66.7%

2043
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,744
I was just making s*** up

2044
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,960
Because Jose attached to the messenger

2045
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,496
He's explaining it

2046
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
Is attention

2047
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,712
He likes to do in order to disseminate this information and

2048
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,344
Fuc yourself

2049
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,816
These talking

2050
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,216
Did people look up to Joe and they respect him he's sitting there

2051
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:36,032
He's allowed to stand

2052
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,056
Exactly

2053
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:37,824
Again

2054
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
Is

2055
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
Attention

2056
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,920
You can see that very clearly

2057
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,992
Imagine being like this

2058
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,344
Hot chick 1963

2059
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,624
Well

2060
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,672
Was looking at number five.

01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,440
Alex

2062
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,232

01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,768
Back in 62

2064
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,328
When it wasn't that many of them

2065
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,376

Tickled by the idea that him saying come dub

2077
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:28,000

And then there's the disgusting of like

2081
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,664
Ascetic

Make a meme of all the time

Everything that he's saying it's like kind of

2086
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,512
Grossen offense

2087
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
He's been tagged

So sad

2089
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,424
Also sad

2090
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,728
Alex makes a claim about something

2091
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,776
Bill Gates

2092
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:16,128
Because

2093
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,408
Alex

2094
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,176
To drop in

2095
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
Proof

2096
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,480
Cathy's clown

2097
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,016
Alright

2098
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,040
Four five times

2099
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,576
None of it proves anything

2100
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:27,136
Example

2101
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:27,904
Is

2102
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,184
Outrageous

2103
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,464
If you're listening

2104
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,512
I would

2105
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,536
Listen to

2106
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
Listen to

2107
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:40,960
All the time edited later

2108
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,728
This is what you chose

2109
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,008
This is your guy

2110
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,592
Oh don't worry the Japanese TV Go

2111
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,128
This going to kill people

2112
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:48,896
It's for the

2113
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,712
Uses for other countries.

2114
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:56,320
It's exactly what you said is representative

2115
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,648
How many times have I told you

2116
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:07,584
Boy you go down Crazy Town Santiago let you know I have a math how he said his territory

2117
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,376
More defended you

2118
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,704
Vaccine cause damage

2119
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:16,544
People not liking about onions

2120
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,128
Japan-china United States are not the target

2121
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,688
We have special vaccines for other countries

2122
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,736
That's not at all

2123
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,016
I mean it was like

2124
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,808
He said

2125
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:33,696
I don't know if I'll find it

2126
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,304
Can't you take somebody who's

2127
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:43,680
Putting in my case

2128
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:50,080
Sing to these tools for infectious diseases

2129
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:54,176
Infectious diseases

2130
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
Pandemics

2131
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:01,600
Crazy situations

2132
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,888
We need to find

2133
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Make it

2134
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,408
Including countries

2135
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:31,808
Have the resources to pay for vaccine research relaxing

2136
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:36,160
Anyway should be the priority for what we do

2137
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,440
Text

2138
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,000
That I'll explain

2139
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
To prove

2140
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:48,448
If you guys get a different vaccine really feel like

2141
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:52,544
It certainly didn't prove anything

2142
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,384
Say that

2143
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,920
He has such a

2144
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
Swims

2145
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,992
Reality

2146
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,784
He hears that clip and that's what

2147
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,576
Thanks Bill Gates

2148
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
Believe that

2149
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,136
Like he's so smart

2150
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,696
He's reading it but yeah I would assume

2151
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:11,488
The most generous explanation

2152
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,256
Make sense

2153
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:17,632
Because it literally says everyone should get the vaccine and we should focus on countries who can't make it for themselves

2154
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:23,264
A priority Global issue

2155
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,288
Countries problem

2156
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,336
I don't

2157
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,896
I like to say I do

2158
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:32,992
Don't get it I don't understand number of

2159
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,808
1 is

2160
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,832
Alex

2161
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,648
Is

2162
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:42,208
He is a consumer of b*******

2163
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,256
And he thinks

2164
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:50,656
You never watch the clip about National file or whatever

2165
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,728
He watched it

2166
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
He interpreted it as

2167
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,288
Completely

2168
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:58,592
Phineas putting it in later

2169
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,872
And so

2170
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:00,640
It's so

2171
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,432
Sad fusing

2172
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,224
Why would you do that

2173
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,248
You know

2174
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:11,136
So you can save it

2175
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:11,904
Dependent

2176
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:14,208
The word is is what you will

2177
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,352
Probably even planted the idea

2178
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:23,424
Bill Gates

2179
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,008
You pick out

2180
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:33,408
Interpretation of his face what I assumed

2181
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:38,272
I know it's like I'm going to tell you what you're about to hear

2182
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,088
Doesn't say what you're about to hear

2183
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:45,696
You just think of people just like not really pay attention

2184
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:50,304
You played a clip of Bill Gates it must have sex in the bathroom I'll skip this

2185
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,864
Rogan's

2186
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,632
Meatheads

2187
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,400
The potheads

2188
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,448
You can print them

2189
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,216
That's fair

2190
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:57,984
That is fair

2191
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,544
Once again

2192
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,336
Takes issue with people who

2193
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,872
Critique his podcast

2194
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:05,920
Interview with Alex

2195
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:07,968
Is also not a good

2196
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,784
There was a lot of people that got tricked

2197
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,064
Attracted

2198
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:14,112
Something other

2199
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,464
Oz description

2200
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,512
More people of that

2201
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,280
Then listen to

2202
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,072
What you don't we did 3 hours

2203
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:24,608
How many

2204
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:27,168
How many Breakout

2205
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,448
Some crazy

2206
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:30,752
They listened

2207
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,872
3 hours and 20 minutes

2208
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,640
Do they do that

2209
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:39,712
Yeah why would we do that

2210
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:43,040
That's a person salt

2211
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:46,112
That is better

2212
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,696
Set is not a broad deliver

2213
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:52,000
That's you specifically

2214
01:49:54,048 --> 01:50:00,192
Most tragic about that is I don't have a good answers why would people listen to hours of someone

2215
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,728
They hate

2216
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:08,896
Described

2217
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:13,248
20 hours like

2218
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:17,088
Screw you talking about YouTube

2219
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
Talk

2220
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:21,696
I do understand that deflection of like

2221
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:28,096
Really long people couldn't possibly listen to it

2222
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,032
Way more painful

2223
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,616
24-hours I was three and a half or whatever

2224
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,408
Two hotdogs

2225
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,856
Platform and he has to have some

2226
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,136
Semblances

2227
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,280
Amex played out on Joe show

2228
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,072
Interesting

2229
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:01,376
Switches stretches

2230
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
Of nothing

2231
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,728
And Alex being so famous

2232
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:10,848
This is a 2% of me as a person smoke Circle and that's the worst

2233
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,896
Possibly

2234
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:17,248
It doesn't have the Showmanship chops

2235
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,832
Being on Alex's purpose

2236
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,368
The problem

2237
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:25,184
Is

2238
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,072
Because he'll just talk about how he ate

2239
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:37,216
Her drink some coffee that gross

2240
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,008
Good how come

2241
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,360
I feel like this must have been in

2242
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,128
Pieology

2243
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:48,224
I feel like this has to be a thing

2244
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:55,392
Come on by

2245
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,952
Get drunk and record something

2246
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,232
I feel like it has to be some

2247
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:07,424
I don't know it's a real bummer exist other than for them to get attention

2248
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,448
It's absurd

2249
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,752
Wild Mountain thyme which exist

2250
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,544
Self-assured

2251
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,384
Westcliffe

2252
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,504
Alright well I'm 27 years

2253
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:22,528
And Joe Rogan

2254
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,600
The best

2255
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:27,136
4 hours ever spent

2256
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:30,464
Thank you so much for us about this world

2257
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,512
That's what's outrageous what is a district

2258
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,536
The best shell

2259
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:40,192
I like ideas man

2260
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:40,960
I do

2261
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:44,032
I like ideas that's why I like listening to

2262
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,056
Is that I don't agree with

2263
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:45,824
Craigslist

2264
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,616
Because I like

2265
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:50,176
Finding

2266
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,224
Things like

2267
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,040
Just wouldn't normally

2268
01:52:55,296 --> 01:53:01,440
Come up in conversations with people I enjoy and I find interest

2269
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,256
Turnleaf

2270
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,048
Be overlapping without

2271
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,864
Specific Project Camelot

2272
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,656
I like ideas

2273
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:17,056
Weirdest ideas that you can possibly get let's fly in the face of danger and see if something

2274
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,336
Beetroot juice

2275
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,384
What is 1

2276
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,408
True dance

2277
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:27,296
Just like Joe was a million times

2278
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:29,856
There we go

2279
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:32,928
Outside

2280
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,464
Nothing ever presented on the show

2281
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,744
I think it was a disaster

2282
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,120
I just thought that I

2283
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,656
Have never been able to escape

2284
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:48,288
Ever since I was like really really young

2285
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:54,432
There's like whenever I was like 10 years old I remember hearing all of my friends have this conversation

2286
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,200
And I remember

2287
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,248
Being in the middle of the talking about I remember

2288
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,296
There's no possible way

2289
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:00,832
10 year old

2290
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,856
End

2291
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,648
1990 blue

2292
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,184
Having an

2293
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,208
Interesting

2294
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:07,744
So

2295
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,792
If I'm having a conversation

2296
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:10,816
Sick for a second

2297
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:14,144
Did somebody have this conversation several thousand years ago

2298
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,424
And then maybe just read

2299
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,728
Maybe read instead of being like

2300
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:21,056
So here's what I think about the universe and what we should do

2301
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:21,824
Who is we should give

2302
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,104
Everybody you know like

2303
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,944
We got to get Elizabeth we got to do shrooms

2304
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,224
Maybe somebody f******

2305
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,808
Thought about it before

2306
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:32,576
Important

2307
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,952
Exploring ideas conversationally is

2308
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
Social

2309
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
Productive

2310
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,056
I certainly know for

2311
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,080
From listening to this

2312
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:58,432
I don't know I am

2313
01:54:59,200 --> 01:54:59,712
I come over

2314
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
Distill down

2315
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
Winx

2316
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:14,048
Left vs right tribalism

2317
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:18,144
Wants to talk about protection there's no possible way

2318
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:18,912
We could be

2319
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,936
Correct

2320
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,264
The point that hours

2321
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,336
Want to talk about how famous Joanne

2322
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:28,640
And how great it is that he's on Spotify

2323
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:29,664
Alex

2324
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:34,272
Generation

2325
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,296
It's just

2326
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:38,880
Like I keep saying

2327
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:42,720
Yeah

2328
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,000
Exposing his

2329
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,280
He's vulnerable

2330
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,560
Underbelly of

2331
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:48,096
Desperation

2332
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:48,864
What's what

2333
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:49,888
Wild to me

2334
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,680
Is ostensibly

2335
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:53,216
These are two proof

2336
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,264
Professional broadcasters

2337
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:58,080
How can you have this

2338
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,360
Conversation

2339
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,384
When you've been doing

2340
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,152
This

2341
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:05,248
Or some facsimile of this job this very job that you are doing

2342
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:08,064
For 20 or 30 years and you come up with

2343
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,344
This

2344
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,904
This is what you got

2345
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:18,048
The Jimmy Carson of our time

2346
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,840
You are no Ed McMahon sir

2347
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,752
If you got

2348
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:28,544
I think I might have

2349
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,592
Also only decided to do this episode

2350
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,384
Because I came up with the title for it

2351
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:37,760
Not a charm

2352
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:42,880
Discussion

2353
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:45,696
DC it was living in a tenement

2354
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:52,864
Fingers crossed

2355
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,936
Price on Twitter

2356
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,496
It's at now

2357
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,544
Dramatics

2358
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:08,736
You could please

2359
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:17,440
To try out that right

2360
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,512
Holding

2361
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,584
Alex

2362
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,144
Christian coloring
