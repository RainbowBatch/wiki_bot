1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge fight

4
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,792
The elders Lane and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
June

6
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
Question for you

7
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,056
We got a little Asia package in the mail

8
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,360
I was a big old box

9
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
Candy

10
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Probably and I don't see it so it was a really enjoyable box still a fair amount of it left

11
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
Stop it

12
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
Eat so much candy

13
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,192
Oh my God it's it's a great there's some

14
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
And no

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Will the wheels are fanciful

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
And I do love a hobnob though the oats

17
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
Man

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,088
British candies are better than ours man I should say that the candies are for me

19
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
Then there's some like weird pickles

20
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,976
Marmite looks for you

21
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
No more batteries specifically there's no notes

22
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,752
That makes perfect sense that's supposed to get the the raisin

23
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
The raisins I don't like those

24
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,640
Somebody wouldn't send us Ravens

25
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
Knowing that you don't like

26
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Unless they specifically wanted me to have

27
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
Exactly you got it you got to consider intent

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Yeah I know I haven't

29
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,904
My bright spot Dan is went out

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,048
Last night with my partner and her teacher friends to toolbar

31
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
Worst place I've ever been to In My Life who is awful

32
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
It's like a giant frat

33
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
Tailgate party on the roof

34
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,824
I'm not going to name the place but it's awful okay and it was

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
Just

36
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
It was so great

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,736
For one reason I would have a Gilbert and beer

38
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
There is a the teachers

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
Are all struggling with their principal at school

40
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
The school's name

41
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
I don't want to give it

42
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
However there was a giant

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Cutout of a football player

44
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
From the Bears

45
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
Number for Lac

46
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
I just

47
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
So appropriately

48
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
The wind knocked it over onto one of

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
The teacher's head

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
I was just a metaphor for how

51
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
They're doing it's cool it was this football player one who is known to tackle people

52
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,832
Tackle people out of character for the state

53
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Exact

54
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Well it's fun

55
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
It was a emblematic

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,072
Awesome I'm glad you had a good time out last night because I didn't know I'm sorry I was in

57
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
So here's the deal Alex's Saturday emergency

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
Podcast from March 5th

59
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
And tell you that's why I'm

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Complaining having a good time and released this in the evening

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,552
Flipping it around in order for us to get it out

62
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Has been asthma

63
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Challenge

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
Without a studio until Friday

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
And

66
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
So I so here we are

67
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:26,239
I'm mad about it

68
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,359
Spiritually his heart may still be in the woods

69
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
Florida

70
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
Kevin I level meetings with

71
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,343
You would assume so there's a lot of b******* going on here and

72
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
I'm not saying that it is a big pig

73
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
Picture of my patience has worn out

74
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Who wears out a little bit

75
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
On the way through this episode I will I will say I'm sick of his b*******

76
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,031
Two and a half hours long because report power 20

77
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
I was ready to

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,895
Do I send it to the Moon

79
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:10,527
Business on this truck but first let's not take a little moment say hello

80
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
Do first

81
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,927
Waking up my partner with Alex Jones saying I love you is going to ruin my relationship that you so much right now about

82
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,815
Thank you very much thank you so much you are now but was he walk

83
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
What's next week is vaccinated goblins boosted goblins thank you so much

84
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
I came for the shrieks and stay for the freaks

85
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Very much

86
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
Picture

87
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,111
So I think so much to our dear Lord

88
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
I have

89
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Risen above

90
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
Miami star

91
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
And then we're going

92
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
To come back

93
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
And I'm going to start the show over

94
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
F*** you

95
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

96
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
F*** you and your new world order

97
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
And f*** the horse you rode in on

98
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
And all your s***

99
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

100
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

101
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
And you never see me again

102
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
That's really what I want to do

103
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
I never want to come back here again

104
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Apologized

105
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
Yesterday that I

106
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

107
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
I'll be better tomorrow

108
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
He's not the reason

109
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
I'll lose my

110
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Frustrated

111
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,719
I don't tend to have a history of watching Alex's Saturday special reports

112
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Periodically

113
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
They're long and typically is interviewing people I'm not really all that interested in

114
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
And so I usually give them a pass

115
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,519
Listening to this made me realize a couple things

116
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
1

117
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Alex needs commercial breaks

118
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Cuz without them

119
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,479
This gets unbearable

120
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
Just him talking without music coming in and

121
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
Singing over where you belong to the city or whatever like

122
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Without that

123
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:31,071
This is a struggle like a two-hour lecture

124
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,167
Play uninterrupted except by a periodic like a you know what I got iodine

125
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Like it

126
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Rough that's brutal it is

127
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
And it's really hard to because he's doing is trying to

128
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
You know we've from topic

129
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Make the topic

130
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
It's just

131
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
It's disorienting and stupid

132
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
I mean he needs brakes to head towards

133
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Without the without the like

134
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
Momentum downslope

135
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Towards the break

136
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
The whole thing is just s*** my guy needs offering he needs offering his half of the show is leading towards

137
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
The off ramp

138
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
It's building towards the point where he can do a

139
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
Plug and then go to commercial like the ability to drive

140
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,663
More but on hill so as long as you can use the brakes right

141
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
You can keep moving

142
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
Right answers

143
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
Involve like sort of dramatic tension and that is based on the

144
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
The timing

145
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,183
Of the breaks we got to go to break

146
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,863
It conceivably will have a new thought that begins on the other side of the break or will continue this but we will got into a

147
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Stopping point it without the brakes

148
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
S***

149
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
It's just

150
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
You get lost

151
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,847
If the officers didn't have the music to play people off

152
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Ubisoft watch

153
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
It'll be long

154
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
So we start off

155
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Beginning of this year report

156
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
I got leanza Alex's

157
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,927
Naturally talking about some Russia Ukraine news

158
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,511
He's got some really really accurate up to date news

159
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,607
Putin has warned that any no-fly zone any country entering militarily

160
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
War

161
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
And that the exact

162
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Second the very second

163
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
That

164
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,079
Any Nation joins in with Ukraine an attack

165
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Russian forces that the Russia will be at

166
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
War with

167
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
That country

168
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Germany has responded

169
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
And said that Ukraine's NATO membership will not

170
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Place

171
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
German

172
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Chancellor

173
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Schultz

174
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
Or something that

175
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Did was ask

176
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
Before before he launched

177
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Abrasion

178
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,007
So this is kind of a meaningless piece of news that Alex is covering but if you consider the point of what he saying

179
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Acetone

180
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
That will be

181
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Verified

182
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
As we go along

183
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,503
When I say this is meaningless it's because these aren't news items that are not unexpected

184
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
Of course Putin would say that putting in a no-fly zone over Ukraine to be considered by him to be inactive

185
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
To be war with any country

186
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Good sides for what

187
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,559
Not an awful position it's not news really I mean

188
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,447
The idea about setting up a no-fly zone would be if a Russian plane where to fly into the no-fly zone

189
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
It would be attacked by a Brighton

190
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
So that would be inactive

191
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
DeVore

192
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
It's very simple and it's not something that

193
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,711
Hasn't already been understood the invasion

194
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,575
When The Invasion album everybody was like if we wanted to we would have already done it

195
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,975
Simultaneously it's also not news to say that Germany is, take the Ukraine will be put into NATO

196
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
Contacts

197
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,679
Prior to the invasion German Chancellor Olaf scholz there was no plan to bring Ukraine into the group

198
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,031
I have very strong hands off perspectives about sending Aid

199
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
Emily duffley invasion they banned any other country from sending german-made weapon

200
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Things to help the ukrainians

201
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
The extent of their support was just sending some helmets

202
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
$5000000 for a field hockey

203
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,695
However the invasion was a very serious turning point in terms of how Germany Angels government

204
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
In particular

205
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Feels about their place in

206
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
The greater scheme of European affairs

207
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:19,167
After Putin invaded Germany went back on their long-standing provision of providing lethal Aid

208
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
Which honestly is a huge deal

209
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
Shoals gave a speech in front of the bundestag on February 27th which signal

210
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Complete change of policy

211
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
In German international affairs

212
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:38,623
Quote fellow-citizens 24th of February 2022 marks a watershed in the history of our continent

213
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,975
What's the attack on Ukraine the Russian President Putin has started a war of aggression

214
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
In Cold Blood

215
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Clearly laid out the aggression on Ukraine is being a clear and immediate threat to the security of the whole of Europe a

216
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Poze multi-prong

217
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Plan

218
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
The first element was

219
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Supporting Ukraine

220
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
The second was an attempt to quotes

221
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
Divert Putin from the path of War

222
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
Largely by way of economic sanctions and embargo

223
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:07,551
The third was stopping any possible sprawl in the war by unconditionally defending any NATO member country

224
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
A particularly by a particular by beefing up presents

225
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
In countries like Romania and Lithuania

226
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,791
The fourth was coming to terms with the fact that Putin is in fact intent on building a larger Empire

227
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
1/5 was rethinking energy Supply

228
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
This was a strong statement of participation in the isolation of Putin and the recognition of the need to support

229
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
People in Putin's pass

230
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
This is a Far Cry 4

231
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Position coming from trolls

232
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
A week prior

233
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
That's notable because

234
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,015
Germany was the main country along with macron

235
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
Kaput and prior to the invasion

236
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,255
There's a real feeling here that this is someone who is deeply involved in the attempt to avert The Invasion

237
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,815
Responding to the invasion with a change in tone

238
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Go to previous data

239
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Is quo

240
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
To leave you to think maybe he knows something that isn't Pub

241
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
It's almost as though in those negotiations

242
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
He was under the impression that absolutely we would be able at the very least to have a good

243
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Conversation about peace

244
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,015
And he's probably figured out that that was never are part of the f******

245
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Suggested

246
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,903
I think that's a very possible interpretation of of these event

247
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
So here's where the angle announces commentary come

248
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,119
He's trying to paint a picture where the reality is the Putin is getting what you wanted

249
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:30,495
He wanted Ukraine not to join NATO and here's Germany saying they weren't going to join

250
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,079
But the issue was the Germany said they prior to the invasion very clearly

251
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,687
Joel said in the press conference which he gave a long with zelensky that quotes

252
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
What's the question of Ukraine membership in the alliance's

253
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
Is practically not on the agenda

254
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,439
This isn't something that's been a change in town it's with Germany's position as well as the position of some other European countries

255
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Long before the invasion

256
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
What else is doing

257
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
Is attempted to create the image of a victory for food

258
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
But it's nothing of the sort

259
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,191
Ukraine wasn't going to be joining NATO anytime soon

260
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,287
Even if their password membership was still on the table and a future possibility

261
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,639
The notion that they were going to be joining and that it was a done deal

262
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,271
Was paruppu justification for his invasion and Alex's essentially playing along with that entire framing

263
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Situation

264
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,903
Was going to go into NATO did once we invaded now they're not going

265
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
This is exactly the sort of thing you'd expect

266
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Wait to hear from a committed Putin Fanboy Apollo

267
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Apologist of propaganda

268
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
And here's the thing 2

269
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,703
Given Germany's very foundational shift in in terms of

270
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Sending weapons

271
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
It may be the case of a rethink some other thing

272
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
Thanks to like the prospect

273
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
I'm supporting Ukraine to join NATO

274
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:45,759
I'm not saying it's necessarily going to be the case but if anything it seems like his invasion could make that more likely

275
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
As well as the

276
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
Possibility people understand the need to protect other country

277
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
There's there's no doubt Vision happened

278
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
More and more countries immediately were like

279
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Let's join 80

280
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
I think that's a way better place to be then they guys gave being invaded right now what's happening

281
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
This wouldn't be happening if we had the backing of

282
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,711
The obligation of the rest of the world specially a lot of the rest of the world

283
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
Yeah it's so this is a strange way that Alex is starting

284
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Bring out the the show

285
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
It gives you a real sensitive

286
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
The Putin Fanta

287
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
Yeah yeah yeah the best way to keep Ukraine from joining NATO is to install a probe

288
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
New regime

289
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
That's usually the best way

290
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,775
It seems to work to starkly

291
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
That they're going for

292
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,127
Yeah

293
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Is here a vision

294
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Now better dumb

295
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
We just are that incredible report that so important

296
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
Pentagon funded bioweapons lab in Ukraine it is

297
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Confirmed

298
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
But US Government documents

299
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
They tried to take down

300
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
That's not fake news

301
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
Caesars

302
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
Qanon narratives that Alex must have seen someone posted a meme about on social media and he's decided to report

303
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
What's fascinating about this is actually predates

304
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
It's covid-19

305
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
State media for

306
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
4 years

307
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Predictably this brand

308
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,783
Conspiracy was deployed to shift blame around after Russia poison Sergei skripal

309
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
His daughter with enervate

310
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,975
The US doesn't help fun some labs in countries like Ukraine and Georgia but the reasoning behind that is pretty simple

311
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,583
After the Soviet Union broke up there were remnants of old chemical and biological aging

312
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Research

313
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,495
They can be done on these things are being done in unsafe location

314
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
USM Ukraine entered into a weapons proliferation

315
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,871
2005 those

316
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,455
Funding to modernize these facilities that Ukraine is already operating

317
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
So that they would have a far lower risk of something going

318
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
Terribly wrong

319
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
Nerve agents in

320
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Chemical weapons getting out

321
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Yeah that's why

322
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,767
This involves a certain amount of information-sharing but ultimately the Ukrainian Ministry of Health is still in charge.

323
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
These facilities

324
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:11,935
Flash forward to the covid-19 China both putting four theories of the viruses made in the lab

325
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Ukraine

326
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
The reasons for this serve the number of purposes for each count

327
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:22,431
We're trying to help push back against the insane conspiracy theories being peddled by people like Alex about China creating the fire

328
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
A Russia it allowed Putin

329
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
Western involvement in and the Ukrainian government as a whole

330
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
As a threat

331
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
Russia which with them justify hostile action against them

332
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,231
Or at least rationalize continued hostilities in the Don Bosco

333
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
Right just cuz it's not true doesn't mean it's not useful

334
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Right

335
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,911
Conspiracy theories of the early days of the pandemic

336
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
There are just too many shiny objects

337
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,287
Distraction conspiracy theorist on Old battle over Ivermectin and Hydrox

338
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Chloroquine in the Alexa

339
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
January 6th

340
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,175
Holy subject attention away for of people like Alex and they lost

341
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
But now the Russians invaded Ukraine

342
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
Conspiracy theorist on the hunt

343
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Anything that can Intrigue people

344
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
It also make Putin's Invasion justifiable to their audiences

345
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
Gold nugget is getting another chance

346
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Spotlight

347
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,815
After this point I've really only heard this Theory getting play on qanon Outlets

348
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
So I guess Alex is

349
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Just decide like my esophagus

350
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Maybe I'll give it a shot

351
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
It's really bad and the only reason you report on something like this let alone lead your program with it is if you're trying to fight

352
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
Look good

353
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527
Lecture he's bombing civilian targets and waging an unnecessary war of aggression but secretly he's trying to shut down these us run by

354
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
Biological weapons Labs man

355
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,231
He's creating heroic story for his listeners to accept so they don't get that idea in their head did Putin is bad

356
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:46,143
I'm not sure if he's being subtle about this but it actually seems hard to imagine awake be more insidiously trying to get

357
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
His audience to support Putin

358
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
Well trying to couches commentary in like

359
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
I don't know plausible deniability an unjust War unless

360
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
He saved all of us from a biological warfare and show you something next covid

361
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
And all of us are just

362
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,415
Getting in his way we do it

363
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Ma'am

364
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
Thrust of the

365
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
Narrative being deployed

366
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,095
F***** up 100% okay too

367
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,191
Publicly murder people but is long as you're secretly

368
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Saving the world from bioweapon

369
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,287
Since it don't exist as long as we can come up with a fake

370
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
Secret reason that you're doing things to do

371
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
Hey it's game on August for us

372
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
So

373
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Alakazam

374
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Concerns

375
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
About the way things are going mostly that

376
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
Lucaya don't like to have to

377
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Bring this up

378
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Buttom

379
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
All ukrainians are liars family

380
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Calculation ceasefire breaks down remain cold

381
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
We don't know that's true because

382
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,679
Someone's getting Ukraine in the mainstream media lie about everything

383
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Flyers either

384
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,591
You can't believe a damn thing they say like the attack on the reactor

385
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
And it would melt

386
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Screw

387
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
The ghost

388
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
The Snake Island

389
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
The list goes on and on

390
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
Alex doesn't

391
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,159
Struggle with statements like this when Putin

392
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,023
He doesn't say that Putin said something who knows if it's true cuz he's a liar

393
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,119
That kind of skepticism is reserved for claims from and about Ukraine

394
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
And there's a utility to this as well

395
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
He's an attempt to give his audience permission to not believe claims that Russian troops are not honoring things like civilian

396
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
Quarters we're not combatants going to leave but

397
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,199
Beach cities which is something that has been reported

398
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,783
There was an agreement to allow citizens to leave Mario Paul

399
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
That ad that was peace after reports

400
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Eyewear that Russian forces

401
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Discontinued shelling the city

402
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Not honoring

403
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Ceasefire

404
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Attack on

405
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
Will you could call that a lie

406
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Haha

407
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,375
Alex doesn't want that image.

408
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
Even be considered

409
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
Possible for his audience

410
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
It's because

411
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
That looks bad

412
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:06,175
Yeah I want to look at these examples that Alex list in order to justify his claims it selenski and Ukraine

413
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Lie about everything

414
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
See if there's any ground to stand on here

415
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,903
Any sorts of conflict there obviously some things to get played up for PR and to appeal to the International Community

416
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,976
That's part of information Warfare but the question becomes

417
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
What is the nature of the thing that

418
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
It's being used for information Warfare

419
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,936
Obviously lying about an atrocity weather saying one did happen when it didn't

420
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
Or saying one didn't when it did is an evil form

421
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
Of information Warfare

422
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
I want engages in this kind of

423
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Action constantly

424
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,968
Most notably with his lies and denial regarding Syria and Assad's use of chemical weapons

425
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,088
As far as I can tell there's no instances of anything rising to that level coming from Salina

426
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Notice Alex even

427
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Have it listed ranks

428
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Anywhere close

429
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864
The first thing I'll explain that the attack on the reactor was a lie or that it was the other was melting down and leaking is a

430
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,984
People on Twitter definitely went a bit overboard with that but definitely

431
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
To happen

432
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
I'll be firing on the plant went on

433
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,360
Demetrio kuleba Ukraine

434
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
Foreign affairs minister tweeted

435
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,504
Russian army is firing on all sides from Zappos

436
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,576
Power plant

437
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
Fire is already broken out if it blows up it'll be ten times larger than Chernobyl Russians must immediately cease fire

438
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Firefighters

439
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Established

440
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Security Zone

441
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
This you could say it's Sensational possibly if you want to or you can say that it was a person who

442
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Who is concerned

443
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,056
But a nuclear power plant was on fire and then something needed to be done about it

444
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:42,432
You could say that the comments you made were possibly inaccurate or over-the-top but that's

445
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Model y

446
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Really

447
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
I mean

448
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
Because there were tons of people who were coming back with

449
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,464
Sober like listen here all the safety measures here all the things it's

450
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,536
Probably not going to explode

451
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
It's bad but it's not going

452
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
To be like a movie

453
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,704
F****** freak out there's not going to giant mushroom cloud that covers

454
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
You know all of Europe

455
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
At the same time

456
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,616
We're shooting rockets in the nuclear power plant man that's not a joke

457
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Right right

458
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,808
Regardless of any possible over statements by the foreign affairs minister to whitewash

459
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,392
Shocking Act of the Russian military targeting nuclear power

460
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
A dangerous wax

461
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
I don't know if this counts as like

462
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,072
Haha such a liar that you shouldn't believe anything these people say

463
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
Yeah

464
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
The second suppose lie Alex brings up his a ghost of kids the story that went around on the first day of the invasion about it

465
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,592
Ace pilot everybody f****** love

466
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Yeah

467
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
It sort of Snoopy

468
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah I mean it's just a mirror

469
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,832
Initially a video when around there was supposedly have a pilot who's being called The Ghost of Kiev shooting down a Russian plane put it

470
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
Video game digital combat simulator world

471
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,584
Halo Pictures supposedly of him have all been shown to be fake and ultimately this is a situation where this person maybe

472
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Not a real

473
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Single person

474
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
They're couple aspects of this that make it not the same as the malicious sort of information Warfare that we discussed Alex participating

475
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,944
There's no indication that the government started this story as it appears to just popped up on social media which does make a difference

476
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,504
Also the intention here is very clear

477
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
A huge fear in terms of the matchup between Ukraine and Russia was that Russia had almost comical air superiority and that

478
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
I would be Ukraine's downfall

479
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,072
People on social media amplifying a folktale about a mysterious fighter pilot with an ominous alias

480
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
It helped people believe that there was a

481
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:42,752
It was a piece of information Warfare that served only the purpose of raising morale and I don't think

482
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,312
The kind of thing you should really consider so heinous

483
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,664
Has the brand of entire country and their leader is a liar especially considering

484
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
It's a story that came out of social media

485
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,320
I don't think this works it's not like zielinski made up the ghost

486
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Cube Storage

487
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
He's like let's get this out there

488
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Yeah

489
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,256
The third example Alex uses a snake island actually one of the worst

490
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
Cases he could point

491
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:11,424
Initially the story was at these people who were stationed at Snake Island told the Russian boat to f***

492
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
Themselves when they died

493
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,544
Or at least it was assumed they died because all radio contact with him was lost

494
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
There was yelling and no one knew what happened so it was assumed

495
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,736
As it turns out they were taken hostage by the Russian troops are still alive

496
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
This wasn't known until Russia released footage of them being held in premiere

497
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:33,440
It doesn't actually change the real powerful part of the story though which is still true

498
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:40,096
I think the people responded to so strongly and that story was the audio of the Russian boat telling them to surrender and them telling

499
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
The f*** off

500
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,192
Defiant in the face of not just overwhelming odds but

501
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Comically overwhelming

502
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,544
That is true and they tried to repeal the Russian

503
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Attack but ultimately ran out of

504
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,992
Emma and they were captured but that the Russian troops to f*** themselves was real and real and that's why

505
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
People were responding to

506
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
Ibotta

507
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:06,208
Ultimately none of the things Alex brings up as examples of things that make him sure that selenski and Ukraine or Liars

508
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,768
This makes sense

509
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
Because all he

510
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,936
He's doing here is grasping at straws to create a justification for his audience to believe that everything they hear about rushing attacks on sofa

511
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
Is not true

512
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,288
Because how can you possibly believe these people with what

513
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,104
That this damning list of lies that Alex has presented

514
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,992
It's all just more attempts by Alex does a pork bun without having to say that that's what he's doing he's a coward

515
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,648
That it's totally okay for food to go into another sovereign country and bombs

516
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
The s*** out of innocent people

517
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
But I will say that it's okay

518
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
So long as

519
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:47,168
Whatever is okay they even have his m************ Liars

520
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,240
Talking about a ghost pilot

521
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Exaggerator

522
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,592
These these people who are

523
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,224
Relying on hyperbole to expire inspire people who would ever consider that

524
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,552
I think that there is a difference

525
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Between like

526
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Let's say

527
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:13,280
Propaganda the country would put out that denies their own like

528
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
Atrocity

529
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Atrocities

530
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
And

531
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,520
Propaganda that a country could put out whether it's someone else puts it out of a tacitly approve of it or they even put it up

532
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
Absolve

533
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Hey

534
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Soldiers get laid

535
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,272
42 like propaganda films words like

536
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah that is kind of like

537
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
It's a little bit

538
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
Dishonest jingoist

539
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,400
But it's not the same thing as like

540
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
I can't believe anything these f****** today

541
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,824
I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a country that would

542
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896
Engage in that kind of morale-boosting

543
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
PR campaign

544
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
Because why would you be like

545
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Chick-fil-A

546
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,880
We are dedicated only to the truth in advertising here we have lost this battle brutally

547
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
We're going to win this war or the opposite side like nothing is going to help holyshit

548
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,352
We're f****** dead said even the truth it's like

549
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
Lay down

550
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,192
Just latest

551
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,592
So anyway really strong sense from the beginning of this special report that Alex is pretty invested in

552
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
Well the same time pretending he's not

553
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Yeah

554
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
Something really weird

555
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Show the prognosis

556
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Run

557
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
From bad to worse

558
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
I just really can't lie to you and I'm not

559
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
That

560
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
This is the date

561
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
What not everybody is going to

562
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Hold on

563
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Find God

564
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,336
Lot of folks are going to find

565
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
Chaos in Oblivion in Mindless

566
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
And this is all just a big test

567
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Equipped understanding and gods

568
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
Input it was them

569
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Complete

570
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Wisdom

571
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
That this is simply a

572
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
Test

573
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,328
And so we have to be very sad for those that fail it

574
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,424
What realize that this plan and everything on it what we're doing is

575
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Completely and totally

576
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Prince

577
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
The actor just turned loose on

578
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688
I think listeners and viewers know things aren't

579
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Going to get very nice

580
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,808
Llamas playing at 90% of everybody dead

581
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
By 2030

582
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,232
Explaining like they really mean to do this and they're really putting things in

583
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Function

584
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
They're going to end civilization as we know it

585
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
Civilization breaks down

586
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
Go watch a movie like The Road Warrior

587
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
For the early 1980s

588
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
And and that's going to be like Jose

589
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Vacation spot

590
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,968
That hellish dystopic

591
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Nightmare future

592
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
Is that guy's I had this framed over the weekend

593
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368
Friday and I forgot to bring it

594
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,952
It's sitting here on my couch and my officer on my desk I had it

595
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,024
Meant to bring it in here with some of my doors open mob

596
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
Well what are you grateful

597
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
Carolina office and get me

598
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Diagram

599
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Got a bunch of overlap

600
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Points

601
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
It's a meme I saw a god

602
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
Good work of God meme

603
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Framed it

604
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Frame to meme

605
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,088
That's your real NFP right there oh my f****** god

606
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Yo

607
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
Doing this

608
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
Disgusting

609
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
Justification session then

610
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,560
Patience bad at everyone's going to be dead

611
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,192
8 years here's a business all the simulation also I should tell you I framed of meme Jesus Christ

612
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,592
I've got to have somebody go get for my office going on in that short clip

613
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
2 minutes

614
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
What arrived

615
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Amazing

616
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Also I can

617
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:22,112
Cialix being a post-apocalyptic guy wearing a wearing a hockey mask for screaming on vacation

618
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,536
Soro Soro

619
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,656
Yeah I would say that if I was going to come up with a title for this episode

620
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:39,008
It would be Alex frame to meme

621
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
It's shocking

622
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
And it is

623
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,152
There's more time spent on it then you might like

624
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,248
All of the Nene is more times than I might like you're out you're not wrong

625
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:54,880
But I was promises he's going to talk about this Meme and then he's going to get to the real shift

626
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
It's a meme I saw

627
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Thursday and I ask my assistant

628
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
On my

629
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
That's Daddy

630
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Someone

631
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
Tell folks that has mild

632
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Walk down the hall

633
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
And to bring that to not be great

634
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Thank you very much

635
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
And I think this says that also

636
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,640
What I'm doing here is this diagram

637
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
And then I'm going to be a good

638
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Boy

639
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
And stop

640
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Holding back

641
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
And

642
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Go ahead just

643
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,488
What are you holding back

644
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,144
Hot you know what I'm telling you everybody who is ever written like a history book or anything like

645
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,984
What kind of idiots are spending thousands of words

646
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,544
Whenever you could put a meme out there

647
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Explains It All

648
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
You can you imagine like a text

649
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
Book I was just full of memes

650
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
That's how you would get a

651
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,296
Good education as opposed to these words

652
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,976
It's so it's a better way to learn

653
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,328
So he has to get somebody to bring it from his office

654
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,144
And this takes a little while so this is a bit

655
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
And I

656
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,800
He's talking about some muscle covid stuff

657
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
That's great news

658
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
It's coming out that they did this

659
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,040
But then when you read the sparse 20-25 2028 Dodge Demon

660
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Put out by

661
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,904
Rockefeller John Hopkins in Belmont

662
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Grove

663
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
They talked about

664
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
How would they hit us with the bio-weapon

665
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,840
How they're going to get caught in the process

666
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
And how that's meant to

667
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Trigger

668
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,216
The loss of confidence in the government the system and collapse

669
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
Civilization

670
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
I was just making that up

671
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:54,432
When we covered Spar as in-depth episode

672
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
The park is just

673
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Completely

674
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Is just out of his imagination

675
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
The idea that officials want to get caught with this whole Web of Lies in order to Road faith in the government notary classes it comes in

676
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
Byerly

677
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
Discussing the late stages of the pandemic response

678
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Square a fraction

679
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Send reports a Big Mac

680
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,728
Emergency funding appropriated by Congress to fight the disease became available partway through the course of

681
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
The pandemic

682
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,824
Federal state and local public health agencies

683
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
Struggle to manage the procedural requirements

684
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Despondent

685
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,248
I would result in significant amounts of emergency funds remained unused as the panic

686
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
Pandadoc wound down

687
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
Have you been suggestions grew in intensity several high-ranking officials at the CDC and FDA were forced to step down

688
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,488
And withdrawal from government in order to

689
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
To quote spend

690
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
More time with their family

691
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,680
Exhausted employees of these agencies many of whom worked long hours six or seven days a week throughout the pandemic

692
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
Simply wanted to put the whole response

693
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
Behind them

694
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:56,896
Little desire remained on the part of decision-makers are those who served in the trenches during the response to rehash the events

695
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
How the past several years

696
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
In this fictitious scenario that's being used in the sex

697
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,368
Exercise some people had misappropriated funds and possibly stolen some of the money but

698
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
Instead of dragging through the mud they resigned

699
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,976
To quote spend more time with their families

700
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
That's the passage in this document it out

701
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,352
What is transformed into the carburetor that you're seeing him present here

702
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:22,752
Cuz he's a malicious liar and also it's ridiculous we saw in real life it's people from the FED who wanted up resigning for

703
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
All of their insider trading

704
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
Duh

705
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
They got it wrong

706
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
Anyway

707
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,224
He's he started to read talk about

708
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
The sparse thing

709
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,808
That's that seems to be more present in his mind

710
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
And soon

711
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
I want to just give a little bit of

712
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
A refresher on it here and there

713
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
But the meme

714
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
Shows up got to find out what it is

715
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
That this meme

716
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Explain this meme

717
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Is tragic

718
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
How tragic

719
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
So-so

720
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,216
So so so tragic

721
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,800
No Titus isn't included a lot of other works of fiction.

722
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Show

723
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
Here's a meme I saw

724
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Meteors

725
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
But it's a bunch of

726
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Overlapping circles

727
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,136
Diagram in the middle it says you are here

728
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
There's a bunch of

729
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
Disculpe

730
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Films and books

731
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
TV shows

732
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,632
You got the Hunger Games the bottom in 1984 at the topping

733
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
Brave New World over on the left

734
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Idiocracy on the ride

735
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
And they lives up in the

736
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,336
Corner and you got Fahrenheit 451

737
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
You got animal farm he got Mad Max

738
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,736
You got soil it green

739
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
You got the mail

740
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
Really you are here

741
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,904
Black artists

742
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
And futuristic

743
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Can people

744
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Projecting forward

745
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,816
Of what they thought the world would look like if things weren't turned around

746
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,400
This is really stupid moron brand for Alex

747
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Moussaka

748
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Cat meme

749
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
Huge huge loser

750
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
Problems of his meme

751
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:05,408
What are the largest being good to Worlds that are depicted in these various pieces of fiction are at

752
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,480
Contradictory with each other mutually exclusive

753
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,880
Explicitly at odds with each other

754
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:20,256
And Aldous Huxley speech Brave New World Revisited that Alex likes to cite and lie about all the

755
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
What time

756
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,608
At its core this meme is a complex Venn diagram

757
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
That's really where the trouble began

758
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:34,080
The point of it is it's obviously supposed to be that you're at this intersection of all these pieces of dystopian fiction

759
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
The middle

760
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
You're here

761
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
It's cute

762
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,968
But it's also really lazy and doesn't pay any respect to the pieces of fix

763
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
It's using as a prop

764
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
Are there are

765
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
For actual Circle

766
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Send that everything else

767
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Is just the intersection of those Circle

768
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,488
To the four circles are 1984

769
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,792
Theocracy Hunger Games

770
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
In Brave New World

771
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,936
From where you get the areas that overlap with your label does being depicted as other movies

772
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
Okay now

773
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Play a game

774
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,664
Alright I'm going to give you the movie that appears in this Meme and you have to tell me the combination of what makes that movie using those

775
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
For initial

776
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,504
Movies wow this is fun I think you should bring this me

777
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,600
Service audio jidenna

778
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,392
Lord of the Flies

779
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:25,280
There's three component okay those for initial movies create the Lord of

780
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Okay Lord of the Flies

781
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
I'm going to go with

782
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
What were the four movies again

783
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:37,568
Idiocracy 1984 Hunger Games in Brave New World

784
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
Hunger Games

785
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:45,760
Nineteen Eighty-Four and Idiocracy

786
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:52,160
Lord of the Flies they didn't create a good Brave New World

787
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
World where they kill Piggy

788
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,024
I did not see that part.

789
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,424
There's two movies that makeup they live they live has to be 9

790
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
1984

791
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
I'm going to tell you your correct

792
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
And

793
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Stampy Hunger Games

794
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
You know what I'm going to go ahead and go with Idiocracy

795
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:20,320
Brave New World

796
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,440
The Brave New World

797
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
So that means what

798
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,424
The Matrix there's three components of Matrix

799
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,496
These are a combination of 1984 in A Brave New World

800
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
That's what I thought

801
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:49,760
I guess baby by you should be able to get this by world and hunger

802
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,856
Matt was Hunger Games simulator

803
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Who knows

804
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,672
Mad Max

805
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,720
Okay well that's got to be

806
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
Brave New World

807
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Hunger Games Hunger Games Idiocracy

808
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,376
Nothing idiotic about the government

809
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
What are very smart for 51

810
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
Idiocracy because they're burning books

811
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:27,136
Maybe anyway the point is if his name is stupid but he pretends to be literate make

812
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,256
The points are Alex's printed it out framed and he's possibly mere days away from selling it as a shirt

813
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,608
There's a ton of variations of this meme using different works of fiction like one

814
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:43,008
Once other than Alex's version use things like V for Vendetta Logan's Run handmaid's tale Gattaca Clockwork Orange

815
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,360
The point is that the specific pieces of fiction or interchangeable for whatever other books

816
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
The movie 1408 because

817
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
This isn't about to make

818
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,016
An actual point it's selling a feel it's just flavor of dystopia today

819
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:59,648
Yeah but interesting lie if you look back over the history of this me and you'll find it actually grew out of a mean friend

820
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
Or people are making

821
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,488
Fun of people comparing everything to 1984

822
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,888
Early versions of a really simple just a Venn diagram of 1984 Brave New World in Fahrenheit 451

823
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,936
With a you are here in the middle

824
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
More less mocking the idea of how unaware these books people are real about everything being orwellian

825
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,968
Using this meme structure to make fun of people like Alex going back to at least last year so

826
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:30,112
It's pretty fun that Alex has decided to frame a picture of people mocking him and his illiteracy he's taking it back though

827
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
He's taking it back

828
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Houses

829
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:40,096
Been on vacation for a week and he comes back and he decides he should take time to brag about framing a meeting listen to possibly insulting

830
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
Sing to him meme

831
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,192
Guys just f****** impressively stupid

832
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,056
What does mean for like half an hour or so

833
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
But here's that he's a real Mike

834
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Mo McRae

835
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,199
Humans are really good at envisioning where things

836
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Are going a lot of people

837
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
Another bad if it's books

838
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
Instead

839
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
This is kind of where they think the world's going

840
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
These are social commentary about

841
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
What the world would be like in

842
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
The year 20

843
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
22

844
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,559
You know what movies

845
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
In 20

846
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
22

847
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
No

848
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
Guess which one

849
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Soylent Green

850
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
Haha we're made of people

851
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,271
Crew make in 1999

852
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
Also the book didn't involve cannibalism in the form of Soylent Green thousand invention of the studio so I guess Alex Reid

853
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,231
Really likes the prophetic work of Richard Fleischer

854
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
Who was the director who also Direct

855
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
The Jazz Singer which featured Neil Diamond blackface

856
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:50,751
Bright Perry Harrison the author of make roommate group has even said that the cannibalism ideas dumb because you couldn't process enough

857
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,543
Enough meat to feed the hungry people that way

858
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
What is that

859
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,127
Every time I've Been Told

860
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
Because I've been told many times

861
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
Neil Diamond

862
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,223
Did blackface

863
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
Every time I'm like

864
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
Behringer Jazz Center

865
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
And then it happens again

866
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,743
Exact same way and I think that must be why everybody just gives him the pass on that is because nobody believes it

867
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:18,143
Really happened it's it's shocking first of all to hear that Neil Diamond starred in a movie

868
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
Yeah yeah

869
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,519
SMS redirected that

870
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Alex's seen movie

871
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:31,967
He said he wants to pretend or real but he also knows that he would sound really dumb if you didn't protect these ideas

872
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,991
Literate background

873
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
These people who wrote

874
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
These works are envisioning

875
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,343
In the future they worried about coming to pack

876
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
That's right

877
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:45,023
Really not true in most of these cases and all that Alex is either intentionally missing or incapable of grasping with the actual point

878
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,071
Have any of these stories actually even about

879
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
Also who gives a s*** when they stories are set

880
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,983
Idiocracies in 2505

881
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
None of it means anything

882
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,311
In my book

883
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
Spoiler alert

884
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
The world end

885
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,199
And it's not cuz I thought that's how it was going to happen

886
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,527
Little John

887
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,087
Some of it is a rhetorical device

888
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,623
Alex is really dumb

889
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,207
He's been a long time so I can let this meme but finally decides to jump off

890
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
Into other

891
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
Territories

892
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
When we hit this imma try to move the quickest

893
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
All this

894
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
And I'm just

895
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Pearson Realize

896
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,239
What a big

897
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
Deal

898
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
All of this is

899
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
And the fact that

900
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
This information comes out

901
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
And then

902
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
It's like

903
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
Blowing on a dandelion in a little

904
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Little parachutes

905
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
Spores

906
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
BuzzFeed go out of it

907
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
Disappear is a WinCo

908
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
They don't know where they land or

909
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
Ali eversprout

910
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
Where that information goes but

911
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
Nevertheless

912
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
This information needs

913
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
To find fertile ground

914
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,991
Cloud Music spikes pressing like his is

915
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:13,087
Show is being like a Dandy lion with all the parachutes going out

916
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,415
And they need to take Route somewhere in order for the plant to

917
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,487
Continue but I would say that it's also

918
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
Kind of like that because

919
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,327
It's just random

920
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:30,751
He just throws a bunch of s*** out there and hopes that landed some soil somewhere

921
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,335
Breakdown let's call it Society sidewalk

922
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
So to speak

923
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:41,759
Yeah if there's other there's other ways it is an apt metaphor it's a surprisingly good metaphor for him

924
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,831
It was delivered in an incredibly clunky way

925
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Yeah that's terrible

926
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,695
So did the big news there's there's some big covid news

927
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,487
Is that Alex needs to get to

928
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
And the first has to do with

929
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:58,143
I recently B commentary made by the head of the CDC Rachel y Lennox

930
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,959
The CDC come out Friday

931
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
I got the clip coming up

932
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
And she said

933
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Oh

934
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,455
We were wishful thinking

935
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
The vaccine doesn't work where

936
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
Sorry

937
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
2025

938
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
2028

939
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
You follow it's a war game

940
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,487
Attacking us

941
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
Is a simulation of what you really do

942
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
A great deal this talk is just Alex rambling and grandiose terms but it is a bayou

943
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
And all this other s***

944
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,335
There really wasn't any concrete claims being made for long stretches

945
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Isn't that so

946
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
Is actually just

947
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
To talk about

948
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,807
CDC Rachel come out and apologize and say the back

949
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Don't work

950
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
That's about to pull

951
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,951
Yeah that doesn't sound true University of Washington and that's a very reflective things

952
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,535
Things to say about the pandemic response of the messaging around vaccines

953
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:02,655
Speaking about how vaccines are being tested and they were seeing 95% rates

954
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:09,055
Let some people may have been too full of optimism but little Caution particularly surrounding ideas

955
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,895
Waning immunity and possibility of new variants copy and covered

956
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,431
As effectively by the vaccine

957
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,527
This was specifically in response to a question of where

958
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Could have been

959
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:25,695
True speaking about messaging failures less than she was saying at the vaccine didn't work mostly because she wasn't saying that at all

960
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,023
How it seems pretty hot on the sparse document on this episode

961
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
Bring it up and making s*** up about it

962
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,423
I suspect he feels like it's been long enough since he's really talked about it his audience with his

963
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,703
Forgotten the main talking

964
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,775
Points around the document we could just use it to fill in whatever holes

965
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:45,407
But he hasn't his conspiracy like I originally part of the

966
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
No

967
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
Let's just almost

968
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:53,599
Like he's just using it where like where it's convenient cuz that's all he ever does

969
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:58,207
This thing about vaccines not working doesn't happen in that scenario exercise

970
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,047
It's important to remember that this is an exercise based on public health message

971
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,095
So every chapter is meant to pick up

972
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Particular challenge

973
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
I could come up in the course of a pandemic

974
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
Make a turtle house

975
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,471
To effectively communicate information

976
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Open to the public

977
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,567
Henderson area there are two drugs that are Central in Port

978
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:18,687
Thursday

979
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,527
And there's an already existing antiviral drug that shows some promise of work

980
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
Condensed bars

981
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
Called Kawasaki

982
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:31,999
Chapter 9 is about messaging The Dilemma of finding out that 4 in further Trials of color severe the

983
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
Actually effective

984
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Treating sparse

985
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
And they pursuing it

986
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
Is possible cure has to be abandoned even though a lot of money is

987
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Open put into test

988
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,079
People ever predictable social media backlash to the withdrawing of Kelo severe is a pretend

989
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
Which is

990
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
Expressed as distrust

991
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,199
The government has any idea that they know they're doing

992
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Around the pandemic

993
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:59,135
This is a no way and I'll get to the story that Alex is telling anti be generous when I say that this is the part of the document he's lying about

994
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927
It's entirely possible that he's just

995
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
Making up what he saying

996
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
Yeah I was going to say

997
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,023
You can you can

998
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
Can say that it's part of this part

999
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
That he's

1000
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,959
Yeah yeah he could be he could be thinking about a completely different parts

1001
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,263
It has nothing to do with what he's talking about

1002
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,663
100%

1003
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,455
A physical thing is just

1004
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
Out of the

1005
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:30,367
The realm of normal this is the problem of trying to like ground some of the stuff in reality and sources

1006
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Is it sometimes it's

1007
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,695
It's not going to happen

1008
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,023
Another big narrative is the big

1009
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,607
New listen to Big Nate big covid-19

1010
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
The Blaze

1011
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
Okay

1012
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,519
Glenn Beck's outfit new bit of

1013
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Information

1014
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,591
It's all come out it isn't a vaccine

1015
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
It's all come out doesn't help you

1016
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,663
It's all come out attacks your body

1017
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
Attach your double helix

1018
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
And now what

1019
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
This is the big new news

1020
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
The new news

1021
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,415
The great researchers thank God there now fully awaken our naive anymore

1022
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
At The Blaze

1023
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
Did something smart

1024
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
They put in a foia request

1025
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:14,143
Concerning federal government spending on propaganda

1026
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,935
Pushing the cupboard narrative

1027
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
And the ended

1028
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
Anti Ivermectin

1029
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,519
Demerit Amanda pro-vaccine there

1030
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
It isn't a vaccine

1031
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,639
Documents for yourself I spent an hour today reading

1032
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
And the government admits they're real

1033
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
$1000000 with spin

1034
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
In the first year

1035
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,367
Abide Megan office secretly

1036
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
To buy off

1037
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,975
Thousands of mainstream media Outlets TV station

1038
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
Networks

1039
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,791
Newspapers local TV

1040
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,607
Just one program we know of

1041
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,191
1 billion dollars and they had to sign agreement

1042
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
But they would have no

1043
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,543
Anti-vaccine cover

1044
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
Total fraud

1045
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:02,015
So when real investigative journalist Folia documents one of the really important things that they do is they post the underlying.

1046
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:08,159
Document so people are reading about their their release can review the actual documents and assess whether or not they match up

1047
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,463
But the claims that are being made in the reporting

1048
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
It should come as no surprise

1049
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,791
The Blaze article that I was just covering

1050
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
Contains no links

1051
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,399
Any of these actual documents to claim that they got from the Department of Health

1052
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Human Services

1053
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:25,311
The article is posted on the blaze has nothing to do with any information they would have been found at any of these supposed

1054
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,383
It's just complaining about media coverage of covid

1055
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,431
And then pointing to already public in

1056
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Information

1057
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
Like the fact that the American

1058
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,807
Rescue plan act or HR 1319

1059
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:40,159
Contained 1 billion dollars in funding for hhsd engaging activities to code

1060
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Strengthen vac

1061
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Being

1062
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:48,351
None of the information in this article would require any for your documents to write

1063
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,399
If this guy even got documents

1064
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:56,287
They aren't as revelatory or shocking as he'd hope so the strategy is just to use their supposed existence as a prop

1065
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
While repeating

1066
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,407
Other salacious information that's already public in the body of the article

1067
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,503
Also to be clear the 1 billion-dollar claim isn't from Florida.

1068
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:09,087
It's from HR 1319 and not all of that

1069
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
Was spot-on advertise

1070
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:16,511
Without the actual document there's nothing being reported here it's just insinuation invade client

1071
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Also

1072
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,375
Another report they can point out is that these guys really f***** up their story

1073
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,679
The whole thing is

1074
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,775
Administration did this but if you go and consult The Blaze article they say that this happened

1075
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,871
Did fiscal year 2021 which is the same as 2021

1076
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,943
No year 2020 what goes from May 1st 20

1077
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,783
22 April 30th 2020 W it's actually something happen under Trump

1078
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Ouch

1079
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
This is partially because the blaze article is cherry picking

1080
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,159
Information and not putting it in

1081
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,439

1082
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:50,815
Recite the American Rescue plan act as a source of this funding but the language in that bill is real

1083
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,839
Continuation

1084
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,911
The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020

1085
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
Future signed by Trump

1086
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,007
Overall this whole article seems deeply misleading

1087
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,055
This paragraph shows up in the post

1088
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,175
Quote though virtually all of these newsrooms produced stories covering the covid-19 facts

1089
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,783
The taxpayer dollars flowing to their companies were not disclosed to audiences a news report

1090
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,159
That's common practice dictates that editorial teams operate independently of media advertising Department

1091
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,487
I am news teams felt no need to make a disclosure

1092
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,047
It's a Publications reached for comment explained

1093
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,655
They have literally no evidence or even the suggestion of Ebony

1094
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
Any of the money went

1095
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,031
News reports about covid

1096
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:38,687
The best of Blaze can do is include a comedic video that was run on NBC featuring Elton John and Michael Caine

1097
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:42,783
That ends with the big placard disco a disclosing funding from the NHS

1098
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:46,879
That's not even the United States and it includes clear disclosure and it's a funny video

1099
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:52,767
I would say whatever documents they got show that they chest

1100
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,559
Slots for psa's if they made

1101
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,351
And which contain disclosure funding

1102
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:01,471
Sources and now the story is being spawned in saying they paid NBC-2 have fauci on or some b*******

1103
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,311
Also important to point out that Alex is also making up details here

1104
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,103
The Blaze story itself is

1105
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,199
Dumb just making stuff up about it that doesn't even appear in the article

1106
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Other weird Point those it

1107
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,271
Infowars didn't even

1108
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,319
Post The Blaze story on their website

1109
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,647
They posted a write-up about the blaze article

1110
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,207
From someone named Emerald Robinson substitute

1111
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,279
She seems like a dumb dumb

1112
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,071
Buzz Marketing

1113
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,215
Infowars is worried that Glenn Beck wouldn't just let them steal his contentedly Post-it like everybody else

1114
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,031
Either way this is really dumb it's not a bombshell at all

1115
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,103
I would say

1116
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
This guy's got to post these for your document

1117
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
If he wants me to take this seriously

1118
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:49,599
Yeah one way to say I'm not going to go I'm not going to go to wild goose chase cuz I went to the foia site and I searched

1119
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,927
Didn't find anything and I'm not going to

1120
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,487
Through every single HHS

1121
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,023
Related

1122
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,559
No you are not I don't have time

1123
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,839
Nope sowbug

1124
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,119
Show your work ding dong

1125
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:05,471
Another way of describing someone is having bought off

1126
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
The media company

1127
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Is to say they

1128
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
Purchased advertise

1129
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Right

1130
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
You know they spent money on creating psa's

1131
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:21,087
Which were very clearly psa's someone could assume that they're from the government included was funny too

1132
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,255
But it was Elton John audition

1133
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
To be in a commercial for covid

1134
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Weather like

1135
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,167
It's giving me directions on how to deliver the line

1136
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,519
Conduit Michael Caine impression

1137
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,359
At the end of the I don't know what call you back we'll see

1138
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Glycol Yahoo NFL

1139
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:49,247
Who you going to get in the short time then flashes to Michael Kay

1140
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:55,135
Alright that's fine what are you going to do what you going to b**** about that

1141
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:04,095
So yeah they paid for those to be made and probably take for PSAs lots and I don't think that this is ask

1142
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,631
Scandal

1143
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,471
Bike Raven desperate weirdos who work for Glenn Beck's

1144
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,775
No it's not strong

1145
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,055
Man

1146
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,847
They could do so much better

1147
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,407
Really couldn't

1148
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:24,319
Do all their processes based on building these convenient and useful lies

1149
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,111
Is they can't do better and

1150
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Because

1151
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,183
Reporting accurate things

1152
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,487
Wouldn't be exciting for the audio

1153
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,815
Now and then the feedback loop gets broken up

1154
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
People stopped paying attention

1155
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,423
Your side cuz you're too into information

1156
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,775
Contacts how do I remove you're not giving me that adrenaline boost that I'm looking

1157
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,567
4

1158
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,591
Did something I don't like

1159
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,151
And so inevitably you just

1160
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Do you do you

1161
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:54,015
You had a chase the dragon that is the audience's fickle attention

1162
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,599
Anyway Alex gets mad about how

1163
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,879
No one told

1164
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,927
Us that we were beat these things were

1165
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,327
Being done this piece fundings Scandal is it Fox News

1166
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
And

1167
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
Newsmax

1168
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:15,263
Are apparently people who took some of this advertisement money

1169
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
They're supposed to be cool

1170
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:20,383
Supposed to be on the side of the Patriot Railroad

1171
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,199
While the FED say it's secret how much they paid news

1172
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
But they did

1173
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
And of course Fox

1174
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,879
That's what I always say I'm not saying you shouldn't take the vaccine

1175
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,671
Everybody should get directions

1176
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,231
All we're saying is you shouldn't be made to do it

1177
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,559
They were told on ABC NBC you name it Fox

1178
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,351
Do criticize it in anyway

1179
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,887
If you have to say

1180
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,423
Everybody should take it but

1181
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
We have a quest

1182
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
The Segway

1183
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,847
Did anybody at Fox News or Newsmax

1184
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
Rcnn

1185
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,175
Tell you

1186
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,527
Did they tell you

1187
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
That they were being

1188
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,439
Paid by the federal government with your taxpayer money

1189
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,975
Ensign agreement

1190
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
Do any criticism

1191
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,535
Or talk to anybody that was critical

1192
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
No

1193
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
You didn't get that memo did

1194
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:20,287
Because it's not true I mean I I would imagine that most of the on-air Talent have no idea what the ad

1195
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,359
Department is up to

1196
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
The complete disconnect from that stuff

1197
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
Also

1198
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,479
Dialysis make up the part about them siding

1199
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
The agreements

1200
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,063
Do they can't do any critical vaccine coverage

1201
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
That's not even the boys article

1202
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,951
Although a good piece of evidence that Alex seems to have forgotten

1203
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
Counterexample to what he's talking about

1204
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
Is the most

1205
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:44,095
Person in the world Tucker Carlson

1206
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:44,863
If

1207
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,631
If

1208
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:52,031
That would blow this whole advertising campaign probably if Fox News is getting all this money and Tucker Carlson won't shut

1209
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
What is deadmau5

1210
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,359
Yeah he cuz he was definitely I mean

1211
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,919
If the money was given to Fox News 4

1212
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
The previous

1213
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
You know

1214
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Then Tucker

1215
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,831
Wouldn't be the most important person in the world because he would

1216
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,855
Have to

1217
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
Say like

1218
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
I'm not saying don't take your vaccines

1219
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,719
I'm not saying no.

1220
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
And then there's no way

1221
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,071
So

1222
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,375
Alex gets off this topic and if he starts

1223
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
What's to get kotopoulo

1224
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
Little introspective

1225
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,471
About his

1226
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
His court hearing

1227
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,615
Sprout is the Saturday evening

1228
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
I think

1229
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,919
If you listen to this clip

1230
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
Just trying to express

1231
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
That

1232
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
Globalist

1233
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,039
Are trying to talk to him

1234
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
Through his court hearing

1235
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
Interest which is

1236
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
That is interest

1237
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,207
Full disclosure I'm talking to lawyers right now

1238
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,767
Because right now

1239
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
People can't do things

1240
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
And mediation

1241
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,143
That in my view was unethical or illegal

1242
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,679
And then expect

1243
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
We're not ever going to talk

1244
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
But I'm going to leave it at that

1245
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,799
But you can imagine what

1246
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
Democrats

1247
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
Subnautica approaching us

1248
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
The frets

1249
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
If we don't

1250
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,431
Get on board with them

1251
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,247
And they even do it in the vehicle of Lost

1252
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,551
Which make me like okay

1253
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,343
I never said one

1254
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,623
And I'm going to go all the way with

1255
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Because

1256
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
Here's the deal

1257
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
There's no bottom

1258
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,487
To these people

1259
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
And they're so confident their takeover

1260
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
They'll sit there face-to-face

1261
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
And say

1262
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,751
Get on board with us

1263
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,567
And not only will this be taken care of

1264
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,103
But you'll be taken care of

1265
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
And you know

1266
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,711
This isn't the only time it's just happen

1267
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
Cuz I like to be able to have these meetings

1268
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
And

1269
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,855
As long as something somebody in doing it's Criminal

1270
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,647
I'm not going to talk about it on air

1271
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
Cuz I need to be able to meet with me

1272
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
People invent over the years of all the

1273
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,279
Had.

1274
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
It's just insane

1275
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Show

1276
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,567
They called the people on I said you want money or you want to be fired

1277
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,127
Do you want money or you want to be sure

1278
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,735
But what good is all the money when you're giving

1279
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,551
Hundreds of millions and billions of people are shot

1280
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
Double Cuts their DNA

1281
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,671
And give them cancer and give them blood clots

1282
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:23,839
I guess Alex is not decided to imagine that he's being tempted to The Darkside by globalist in his court hearings and this is getting exhausting

1283
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
And really dumb

1284
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:31,007
Globalist is so f****** stupid

1285
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:37,151
Beaufort High School as long as people are doing anything illegal but these people are working for the devil too

1286
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,431
To kill every human

1287
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,551
Supposedly proven all their plans and not only that they've admitted he's right that they want

1288
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
Join them to

1289
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,879
They're doing very legal thing

1290
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
Most illegal things

1291
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,463
Anything Alex is saying

1292
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,023
It's true if you are telling me

1293
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
20 minutes

1294
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
Set the globalists plan

1295
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,167
Is to kill 90% of the world within 10 years

1296
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
8 now

1297
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,591
You're going to tell me that you're taking meetings with these folks and they're trying to convince me

1298
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,615
To join their side

1299
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:14,527
Kill 90% of the world man what's up

1300
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
No no I got to keep my journalistic Integrity intact but not saying it often items I was off the Record

1301
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:27,071
It was off the Record so dumb

1302
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
Put aside the whole Intrigue of killing everyone off and all that stuff like chicken

1303
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,775
Because they're attempting to extort him

1304
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,591
None of this is real at all it's just Alex's

1305
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,663
Do you the way that he's decided to dramatize his court hearings

1306
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:45,759
Use those dramatization sad to Zone victimhood in martyrdom complex

1307
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
It's kind of boring and I don't believe

1308
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,367
I don't believe that even he believe

1309
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,207
But yeah it'd be more fun if one of Tom Clancy's Ghost Riders rode his trial

1310
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,743
That's what he would be gone for there

1311
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Yeah

1312
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,583
So Alex gets to talking about how Greg Glenn back

1313
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
Because I guess

1314
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,959
He's cool now konsisten

1315
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,031
Can't even talk about how good Glenn Beck is

1316
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,079
I got to making it about himself

1317
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,871
So again I will recap

1318
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
The big nose

1319
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,967
Infowars.com it's on blaze.com

1320
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
I want to salute Glenn Beck

1321
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,087
I want to encourage people to turn into his show

1322
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,879
He's a good man

1323
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951
He didn't believe me

1324
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,999
20 years ago or 10 years ago and

1325
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
Thought I was a liar

1326
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
Because

1327
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
I was a man way out of my time

1328
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,655
But he now knows the truth

1329
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:41,055
Funny how this blood for Glenn Beck is Alex's uprofit the time nothing

1330
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
To do with this article

1331
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:46,943
It was written by Chris pandolfo but Alex has no interest in the little people

1332
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,015
Everything that happens at Infowars is essentially dumb underling

1333
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,807
Carrying out Alex as well so I

1334
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,623
I guess he assumed the same as true everywhere else in that

1335
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,927
Everything at the blaze is a function of

1336
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:03,583
Of Glen back like every Dave Rubin episode is basically under written by

1337
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,887
But he believes all news organization

1338
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
Jebaited

1339
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
Is a megalomaniacal lunatic

1340
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,543
At the top was just telling everybody like Doling out tasks

1341
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,639
Because a lot of the appearance

1342
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,175
Personality trait

1343
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,735
Sure but I think he also

1344
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,271
Is not

1345
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
That much

1346
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,111
Of an idiot to like micromanage

1347
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
So much and doesn't want to work that

1348
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:33,279
Alex is working hard

1349
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
So Alec

1350
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
Textbook man

1351
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
He left unicorn.

1352
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,799
Everyone. It's all about God maybe

1353
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,847
Siri is no future if you don't stop this

1354
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
There's not who's the biggest talk

1355
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,455
Show host who's got the most money in the bank

1356
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,551
None of that means anything that might have meant something to him before

1357
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,135
All that matters is

1358
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Good

1359
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,695
Having relationship with God

1360
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,999
Being able to protect

1361
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,303
Yourself and your family into the future here

1362
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,375
Because we may not be able to save even

1363
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
Abase

1364
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
6 symbolization

1365
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,727
We are approaching

1366
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
The point

1367
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,519
Of no

1368
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Return

1369
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
Right now

1370
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
And that's okay

1371
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,919
Because what

1372
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
What this is really all about

1373
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,063
Is our personal

1374
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Ship with God

1375
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
And infinity

1376
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Eternity

1377
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
And that's what

1378
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
I thought it was about the banks

1379
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
Super duper World Order

1380
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,007
When you're when you're running Putin apologies

1381
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:50,079
I'm trying to get people onto the side of it

1382
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,895
School for Putin to go to another country murder everybody

1383
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:57,247
How's your personal relationship with God strong

1384
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,551
Strong is Godlike man you are

1385
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,951
Crocheted apron kind of feels like this might be cowards Refuge

1386
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:10,303
I think might be relying on religion to fill in the blanks for how

1387
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,839
Terrible in cowardly

1388
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
Haha

1389
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,423
Now

1390
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,215
I will admit

1391
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:20,543
Myerly careers

1392
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,871
Was Paul was great cuz he's going to reduce regulation

1393
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
He's going to audit

1394
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:30,271
That's what it's all been about the hotel really that was about to die

1395
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,831
Auditing the Fed was about the devil

1396
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
Horse

1397
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:40,255
Play this next week where he's he's sort of going deeper into these thoughts just like

1398
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,327
Imagine if after 9/11

1399
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
He spoke like this

1400
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,887
Imagine how

1401
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:52,031
Non-career he would have he would not have a f****** career

1402
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,311
If you didn't wait

1403
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:57,407
Until he'd already sucked a bunch. Start with this s***

1404
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,199
The Bible tells us

1405
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
Before the simulation ends

1406
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,039
Three-dimensional real simulation

1407
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
Play everywhere the Bible says simulation

1408
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Universal

1409
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
Leidsa

1410
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,463
Where do the simulation ends next month or in

1411
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
Thousand years are a trillion years

1412
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
But

1413
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,559
God gives a pretty good idea about

1414
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
What

1415
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,679
Simulations done God rolls up the universe

1416
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Scroll

1417
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
We jumping

1418
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,823
That's not in the book

1419
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
Who knows of our memories will be wiped

1420
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
What

1421
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,223
Point is is

1422
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,015
That's what this is

1423
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,319
No career

1424
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
No career

1425
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
That's gotta suck people in with this fun International conspiracy Levy the bush did 9/11

1426
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:50,399
This phone false-flag stuff in Mysteries that are terrestrial that you feel like you can solve

1427
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:53,471
Various influence of the Rothschilds and what have you

1428
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
And you have to make

1429
01:07:54,751 --> 01:08:00,895
Fun of people like David Icke you say the people of shape-shifting lizards

1430
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,175
I'm just about to

1431
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,711
Solid provable facts

1432
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
And then

1433
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,599
Once you've duped enough people into thinking you know anything about what you're talking about in your careers

1434
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,367
Kind of falling

1435
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
Copart

1436
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,439
Might as well just let it go and

1437
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
Start with your you know

1438
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,535
Your constant insane

1439
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Rod religious trance

1440
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:25,215
Well I mean they don't start you out with Xenu on day one at scientologists true he's into that

1441
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,287
Hey by the way

1442
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:34,943
I'm going to ask you to cut your arm off in a few years check that out the cost of entry for Infowars is cheaper

1443
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,247
Iodine is not cheap but not

1444
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,527
Not as expensive is

1445
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
Some Scientology courses

1446
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:46,719
Also I don't think Alex is interested in having blackmail on dieses listener

1447
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,535
Let's see how desperate he gets this is lunatic

1448
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
Straight up

1449
01:08:53,887 --> 01:09:00,031
You don't got to go to wipe your memory if you believe the whole thing

1450
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
What is the test

1451
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,871
What's the point of God wipes your memory

1452
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,431
Your memory not your ancestral memory

1453
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
Your race memory

1454
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,623
Cuz he's got to make my stuff up and then giving it religious significance

1455
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,231
Which is what real cool Nan

1456
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:25,631
Malicious narcissist when's the last time a Sci-Fi nerd got way too into religion it

1457
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
It went great

1458
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,703
I don't think Alex has the organ

1459
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
Relational

1460
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Capacity

1461
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:36,895
To pull us through

1462
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,223
If the people out and not big enough

1463
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,759
So I look

1464
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,063
People come to him much like

1465
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,879
Take the HHS turnout and offer him money

1466
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,183
I have some follow-up questions

1467
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,975
About some of this stuff

1468
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,279
Just pathetic I mean good job Blaze

1469
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,375
They are not to come to Blazing offering money to push the vaccine

1470
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,679
They do not come here to offer money

1471
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,263
Yeah that wasn't hard to give me money and then get anything you want

1472
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,359
You don't put quarters in in Alex Jones and then

1473
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,895
You know get back out of it

1474
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
What you put in

1475
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:16,063
Smash got to him doing a my pillow ad

1476
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,111
Last time I got offered a bunch of money

1477
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,439
3 years ago reset Wars what

1478
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
That wasn't about

1479
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,071
It offered money by government

1480
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,375
Bi-Lo

1481
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,959
That's how the real world Works folks

1482
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
And you're looking

1483
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
At the guy

1484
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,031
I'm not bragging

1485
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,103
I'm just telling you you're looking at the guy that can't be bought right here

1486
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,663
Looking for

1487
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,455
This is the real thing

1488
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,503
This is a real McCoy warts and all

1489
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
You got it right

1490
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,807
And I know you're just like me

1491
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
Okay

1492
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:55,231
3 years ago Alex was had a governments try and give him a bunch of money anywhere to the FBI about

1493
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,767
What was that Alex

1494
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,559
Oh boy

1495
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:04,959
You know there's one government I know specifically who's really into that guy

1496
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,031
Trying to pretend it was

1497
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,567
Trying to pretend that Russia

1498
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,103
Tried to give him a bunch of money

1499
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,127
I think that's

1500
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,711
Probably the application

1501
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
If this is true

1502
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,783
That he went to the FBI

1503
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,575
That's the part that I would like

1504
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:26,719
U.s. government cuz he went to the FBI know I would imagine that what really happened is somebody

1505
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:31,839
Faked being from a Russian troll

1506
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:38,239
Play sounded like I hate will give you 10 trillion dollars if you say bubba bubba and he was like

1507
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:44,639
I also don't believe you went to the FBI's at Dr 11999 4678

1508
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,199
I mean like

1509
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,039
I don't know I don't know how much I believe

1510
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,855
I kind of think there's a possibility that there might have been

1511
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,391
Some like

1512
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,463
Like with the DHHS.

1513
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,255
Maybe there was a

1514
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,023
Buying

1515
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:07,423
High-interest like Artie or the one of these thing to buy advertising on little Wars totally I could see that be

1516
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,239
McKay's all of that describe it like that

1517
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,079
I don't know anyway I just think that when you say something like this

1518
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,639
I think you're required to follow up with the

1519
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
Details

1520
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:21,247
Because otherwise do not do that leads me to believe first of all you're lying

1521
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,551
If you're not lying

1522
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,343
You're covering up what government it is

1523
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:28,671
Because you know that it'll make your coverage look bad

1524
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,767
It's all a bunch of money surprise

1525
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:36,351
Weird weird

1526
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:42,751
To save his money I think

1527
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,311
I think that it raises more suspicions

1528
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,103
To say nothing

1529
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,503
Explain what you're talkin about to be like Luxembourg offered him ten

1530
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
No

1531
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,647
Alex gets back to his wacky religious stuff

1532
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
Your

1533
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,719
And I will tell you that this

1534
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
Start

1535
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,047
One of the best Alex Jones

1536
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,071
Starting

1537
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,911
He wants to explain what the theologians are wrong about

1538
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
Okay wow which one

1539
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
All all of them

1540
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
Anyting

1541
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,407
Has been gotten Wrong by the theologians of the

1542
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,431
The culture the rest of it

1543
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,455
Is that the

1544
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
Which level you just

1545
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,271
Everything so

1546
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,063
Happy and total perfect

1547
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,391
If you choose to be in that presents

1548
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,183
And be complete

1549
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,511
You can choose to stay there and be complete in God's presence

1550
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,815
You can choose to stay at that level

1551
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,631
Absolute connection doing Saturday

1552
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Add

1553
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
Attainment

1554
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
You can

1555
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
Go to

1556
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,103
Places

1557
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
What

1558
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
What places

1559
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,967
Side of the concert

1560
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
God

1561
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,551
That doesn't make any

1562
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,623
Satan's attempt

1563
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
At this level

1564
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,975
What's places

1565
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
Those places

1566
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
Okay

1567
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
Tell you my friends I've been beyond

1568
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:21,055
No career if you absolutely f******

1569
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:27,711
Nuts thrown to the f****** trash bin if he was talking like that

1570
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:33,855
Get him to stop stop doing this cuz it the Saturday show you work for this man as he says

1571
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:38,207
Don't worry Satan tried to make his own evil Universe outside of God

1572
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:42,047
Subconscious and I've been there my love

1573
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,631
I'm not sure what the Illusions Alex is referring to but I suspect

1574
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:49,983
It's just the Illustrated children's Bible he reads out of with pictures of people playing harp

1575
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,287
Yeah that would be what's going on

1576
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,383
Stupid there are two possibilities here and I think they're both trash

1577
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:03,039
The first is that Alex actually means the things he saying and clips like that and in that case you should be hospitalized immediately

1578
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,647
He's completely insane and detached from reality rambling Beyond gods

1579
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
Consciousness

1580
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:12,767
The other possibility is that he doesn't mean any of this and he's just a dorky f******

1581
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:16,607
Can child drink these meaningless esoteric ramblings

1582
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:20,959
But how holy he isn't it that case I think he probably should be hospitalized too because it's

1583
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,007
Speaks to level of narcissism that is

1584
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
Dangerous

1585
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,359
I know I've been banging this drum quite a bit but

1586
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,407
Just try and imagine

1587
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
Him

1588
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:34,527
I think he could be taken seriously like 2003 talking like this

1589
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,551
His career would have

1590
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Vetoed amazing

1591
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,111
It's it's

1592
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
Embarrassing

1593
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
You listen

1594
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
Sometimes

1595
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,767
You don't necessarily need a boss

1596
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
But you need somebody

1597
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:51,935
Need to check on I like what I was saying about how unbearable this show is commercial breaks

1598
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
You need

1599
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,471
Something

1600
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
Something

1601
01:15:54,751 --> 01:16:00,895
You need something to check your b******* yeah you can't you can't live in a situation where your narcissism

1602
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
Can't be

1603
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,199
Let run wild

1604
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,247
Does inevitably I think you

1605
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,319
Do you have the Tendencies of someone like Alex you just going to end up

1606
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,879
Turning yourself into like

1607
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,927
Transdimensional

1608
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:17,023
The pseudogod

1609
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,351
It is fun

1610
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
But you shouldn't do it on the radio

1611
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,935
No it specially when you're whole

1612
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,471
Stick is that like

1613
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:31,871
You've proven everything you say and I'm right about everything

1614
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:38,271
Everything we say is documented tomorrow's news today

1615
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:42,111
Absolutely

1616
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:48,511
Frames a meme on his wall buddy where do you think you bring that back from a universe outside of Gotham

1617
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:52,607
How much does a passport cost

1618
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,679
F****** idiot man

1619
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,727
Anyway back to news

1620
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,543
Stories against seraphim at the f******

1621
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:06,943
Gates just alright you bringing anything in from outside of God's consciousness

1622
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,711
Like a

1623
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Yummy fruits

1624
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,319
Vegetable are they

1625
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,647
Is it just cuz we're in multiple Dimensions doesn't mean we don't have rules

1626
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,463
Backup back to news news

1627
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,511
Another video on a plane a moment

1628
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,095
Are executive brags mRNA shots

1629
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,631
Are gene therapy

1630
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,447
Marketas vaccines I'm going to hit

1631
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,727
This news the wrestler

1632
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,495
Story

1633
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775
Here's the clip

1634
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,359
World

1635
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,895
Health Summit

1636
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,431
And the UN here it is

1637
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
Ultimately

1638
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,367
Are an example for that salad gene therapy always like to say

1639
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
We have surveyed

1640
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,415
2 years ago

1641
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,231
And the public would you be willing to take

1642
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,511
Jeans

1643
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,583
Dino cell therapy and injected into your body

1644
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:59,423
We would have probably had a 95% refusal rate I think this

1645
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,959
Pandemic has also opened

1646
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,751
20 people's eyes 2

1647
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
To Innovation the way

1648
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
That was maybe not

1649
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,359
Possible before

1650
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,431
This was a guy named Stefano Ricci

1651
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,759
Giving a speech at the 2021 World Health Summit

1652
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:17,343
The clip really illustrates Alex's failure in terms of reading and listening

1653
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Incomprehension

1654
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,951
The clipboard Alex plays doesn't include all Rick sang with covid-19

1655
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Sian is a gene therapy

1656
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:29,887
He's saying that the success of this mRNA vaccine should give people hope about the possibility for future Gene

1657
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,167
Or cell therapy

1658
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,983
I was just lying about this guy's paying B

1659
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:38,591
Because what he saying seems close enough for Alex add false context to his comment

1660
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,639
Puerto Rican Solitude is audio

1661
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,663
Even though it's a lot

1662
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
It's brazen

1663
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,503
Like if you go to the Infowars article about this

1664
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,295
It includes this quote which is

1665
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,343
Is one of the things that Albrecht said there

1666
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:54,975
Ultimately the MRNA vaccines are an example for that cell and gene therapy

1667
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:59,071
Which is meant to give me in person that already saying that the covid vaccines are example

1668
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
Settling gene therapy

1669
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
But he's not

1670
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,703
If you watch the full speech you saying that the

1671
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:11,103
Leap Forward embodied by the MRNA vaccines are an example of how he hopes progress could be made on selling Jean-Pierre

1672
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,639
Are bees the bear is working on

1673
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,431
I see no way

1674
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
Describe this other than

1675
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,759
A complete intentional li-ion Allison Park

1676
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,783
It's disgust

1677
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
Yep

1678
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,855
Such a shortcut take

1679
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
Can prick

1680
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
Call me baby

1681
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,927
It's a very good point

1682
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,047
It's it's hard hard to argue with the point that he's making which is like

1683
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,327
Tons of people

1684
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,679
Would have been like

1685
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,263
He's old and he's also not

1686
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,359
Citing any kind of information that people are actually more willing

1687
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,895
To take salary

1688
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
No so like

1689
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
That is only a thought

1690
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:48,991
T.i.

1691
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
End

1692
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:55,647
Maybe there's green stuff thought maybe there's not but whatever the case Alex is taking this and

1693
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
I'm just

1694
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
Bucket line

1695
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,511
This makes go back to the kind of made me chuckle

1696
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607

1697
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
The documents

1698
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
It's out of a Statin

1699
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
Statistical site

1700
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519

A long time ago but it's been Republic

1703
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,920
And it goes into hell

1704
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,760
Lavishly funded moderna by Bill Gates in the defense department

To revolutionize medicine

1708
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,928
That news is not a site about statistic

1709
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,584
Hate to say that focuses on healthcare related stories and the name is a reference to a doctor say they need something stat

1710
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:43,520
Kirara tolerable to not be able to take every opportunity to present himself as the guy

1711
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,544
Who knows everything

1712
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,944
We can't really resisted making stuff up to make himself seem smarter even though if you know anything about what he's talking about it just makes

1713
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,480
Look like more of a desperate idiot

1714
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,784
This article that Alex's reference

1715
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,576
Dancing is from January 2017

1716
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:02,720
Illustrate that mRNA vaccines were never able to get approved because they killed everyone in the trials

1717
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
Here's a little clip of him talking about that article

1718
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,584
And it goes into

1719
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,376
How they set all this up

1720
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,192
And how they develop these systems

1721
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,496
But how they had so many problems and trials

1722
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,056
With them having bad results for killing people

1723
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,848
That Madonna was in trouble

1724
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,896
You got to go read this whole article

And it goes on to say

1732
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,232
MRNA is a tricky technology

1733
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Several major pharmaceutical companies

1734
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,560
Idea

1735
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,632
MRNA into cells without triggering

1736
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,912
Nasty

1737
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
Side effects

1738
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
Nasty

1739
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:50,080
The essential problem here is that Alex has once again

1740
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:50,848
Making things

1741
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:55,968
This is about how an mRNA product was working on

1742
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,016
Jennifer kriegler Najjar syndrome

1743
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,576
Direct edition if I can deliver it wasn't working

1744
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,880
I did run into troubles in animal testing

1745
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:09,792
Alex has had multiple times on this episode that it made people's livers liquify but this article is really specific that the drug

1746
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,328
Never made it to human trial

1747
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:18,496
I think he's just making that part up about because he saw the word liver and the description of crigler-najjar and even wrote his own

1748
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,264
Story about it

1749
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,824
Yeah it's going to look water water livers

1750
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:27,456
Because of the difficulty with this particular treatment this article explains that moderna was shifting its focus

1751
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,992
Vaccines for quote

1752
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,784
To Target strains of influenza

1753
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,576
A service for zika virus and

1754
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,600
The fourth remains a secret

1755
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,000
There may have been some trials for perspective medications that used Mirna technology that resulted in some

1756
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,048
Side effect you might say our nasty

1757
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,864
But the same is true of many different medication types

1758
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,168
Veteran trials

1759
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
That's why they do trial

1760
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,984
Exactly

1761
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,336
You can find plenty of examples of free covid mRNA studies that don't show horrific side effects

1762
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,688
Reply was always the case right it's just his argument s***

1763
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,504
It is very interesting but it's

1764
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Not really about

1765
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:06,880
The negative side effects of being a problem woman and more of it

1766
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,648
Just being like

1767
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:14,048
Their countries are there that company seems like an a*******

1768
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,096
Thrust of this article is

1769
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,888
That's probably true

1770
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,984
Perform Alex does get back to talking about liquid livers

1771
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
Help

1772
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,544
Maybe I just read the prologue

1773
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
Do it

1774
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
I dare you

1775
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,128
Incredible

1776
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,408
Stat news

1777
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
The whistleblowers

1778
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:36,064
Other times that whistleblowers come out of these companies

1779
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,088
Stop it

1780
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,160
And the biggest thing it does and you read the articles that are linked

1781
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,184
From that's what I did

1782
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
Is it

1783
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:42,976

1784

Jerk

1790
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,872
Yeah bring it up the liquid livers

1791
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,432
There are five articles that are linked

1792
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
Any sad news article

1793
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,040
One is about the other zika vaccine candidates

1794
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,344
Better come and get the trials that are in competition with moderna

1795
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,720
Right one of them seems like a dick and he's lost some top talent because he's a dick

1796
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,560
Another is an interview with that Co in Forbes

1797
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,656
The 4th is a CB insights article about modernist valuation

1798
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:25,216
And the last one is the closest without stalking

1799
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,520
About which is an editorial in nature that

1800
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,312
Pretty negative about moderna

1801
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
As business plan

1802
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,872
From liquid livers.com

1803
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
If not

1804
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:39,296
The problem is that article is about how moderna wasn't publishing information about their research so not really could evaluate what they were doing

1805
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,856
Couldn't tell if they were just another theranos

1806
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:46,464
Right right right. The publishing schedule

1807
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,304
So here's what the article says in relation

1808
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
Delivers

1809
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:55,680
Quote patience with crigler-najjar are missing a key liver enzyme

1810
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:58,240
Needed to break down bilirubin a yellowish Subs

1811
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,032
Since that crops up in the body

1812
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,336
Has old red blood cells break down

1813
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,176
Without that enzyme bilirubin proliferates in the blood leading

1814
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,736
Jaundice muscle degeneration and even brain damage

1815
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,552
Yet but I could not make it therapy work

1816
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,600
Former employees in collaborators say

1817
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
The safe

1818
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,672
This was too weak and repeat injection

1819
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:21,280
David O strong enough to be effective effects on the liver in animal studies

1820
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:28,448
The rest of Alex's entire presentation is just completely made up which is why he's never going to read the entire article when he says he should

1821
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,776
Cuz he knows he's a liar and the information that he'd end up reading

1822
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,056
Wouldn't satisfy

1823
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,848
And why do that

1824
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,920
If you read the article he would just have to editorialize and

1825
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,736
Say about the ship pretending it's in the article why not

1826
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:47,136
Skip that step it up anyway seen him read things they actively counter what it is he was

1827
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,952
Just saying

1828
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,888
Say something that disagrees with his like

1829
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:01,216
And that's why they're that's how they you know they're lying

1830
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,288
F****** piece of s***

1831
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,592
Total

1832
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,384
Total piece of s***

1833
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,664
My father

1834
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
Do I love a lot

1835
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
Almost died

1836
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
From Delta

1837
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,808
My mother was the second she's ever been

1838
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:16,832
Robbed

1839
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,856
Almost died

1840
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,904
Still seriously sick

1841
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,232
I have other family that

1842
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
Died

1843
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,072
I felt like I had 1000 lb gorilla

1844
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,608
Sitting on my chest

1845
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,376
For two weeks

1846
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,680
Did make a big issue out of the time I was on there with it

1847
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:35,520
You came on are you came to Studio

1848
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,312
For two weeks without

1849
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:43,712
A mask everybody around you you're saying got really sick and still dealing with the side effect

1850
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,040
You are I would say a central

1851
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:50,112
Hub in the middle of all of these other data points

1852
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:55,744
I too if I were Alex will probably invest a lot of emotional attention

1853
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,304
And you trying to talk about how this is a

1854
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
Bio weapon plan

1855
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,632
Voice did Upon Us by the globalist

1856
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,680
Because the alternative is recognizing

1857
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
That he's

1858
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,728
Stubbornness

1859
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,520
Inability to be

1860
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Be careful

1861
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,080
And take things seriously could

1862
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:12,896
Have it affect gotten everyone around him sick

1863
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
And everybody that he cares about

1864
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,224
Almost dying

1865
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,320
Probably pretty difficult emotionally handle

1866
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,112
Probably Retreat into bulshit

1867
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,416
Conspiracies too if I heard that

1868
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,440
And I work today

1869
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,256
Infowars.com

1870
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:34,656
I would be like oh goodbye I have a massive lawsuit guess what I'm another person who's going to the globalist

1871
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:41,056
Message which is you piece of s*** cuz this is Alex saying that he

1872
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,872
Knowingly

1873
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,664
Yes that is that is

1874
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:52,064
The very least they literally I can't give you a disease

1875
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,136
Unsafe working environment but I am fairly certain

1876
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,160
You could at least

1877
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:00,512
I mean did you do did he travel

1878
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,304
He walked in the office without his f******

1879
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,608
Mascon I don't think so because I would

1880
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,680
Assume that at least some of them would f****** leave

1881
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:13,312
I know that at least some of the people who work it in fours or probably

1882
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,872
They're on board with everything and

1883
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,920
Zealots like him

1884
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:21,248
I don't think everybody is just have to be like this

1885
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,368
It's a game

1886
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,672
I don't know

1887
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
I think crazy

1888
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:35,840
I would encourage anybody who works at enforce or work out of him

1889
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:42,240
Abuse lawsuit that you almost killed me you dick

1890
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,568
But he loves them a lot well I wonder how much

1891
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,408
Alex

1892
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,968
He also now loves Glenn Beck

1893
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,736
Why not

1894
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,272
This is sad

1895
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,344
One back is the biggest show we've got

1896
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
It's getting deep cleaning right

1897
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,392
371

1898
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Rogan's

1899
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,464
Bigger but he's only getting into

1900
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,256
Some of some of these starting to really

1901
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
Michelle wants to know some

1902
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,608
Carlson's Heating

1903
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,632
Song that's good

1904
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,680
Patty processing on Glenn Beck

1905
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,448
Because

1906
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,800
Cuz

1907
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,080
It's really good and fully awake

1908
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176
I'm going to Amazon.

1909
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,320
Not even that

1910
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,416
It's not even that I don't want to be here anymore

1911
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
Wichita

1912
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,512
I just feel like it

1913
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,536
It's time for other

1914
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,840
Just stand up

1915
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,120
Ficus

1916
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,144
Yeah please

1917
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
Please

1918
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:49,312
Let let let Glenn Beck be your spiritual successor you dumb prick go for it oh my God

1919
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:55,712
Wait wait for him to take over the mantle for Alex and then like within a year apologize for

1920
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,736
For everything and then leave

1921
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:03,136
Try to get on Trevor Noah's show on some apologizing

1922
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:08,000
Mark Levin pulls out all the funding goes away for

1923
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,280
Blazing

1924
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:15,680
Oh I don't know he has to fire Dave Rubin and Steven Crowder and then write the fun

1925
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,472
1 right turns against timid

1926
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
Oh no he's crying

1927
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:23,360
I just pulled out of chalkboard cuz it's his only friend that's life

1928
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:26,432
Also let's imagine how f****** quickly this whole thing falls apart if he

1929
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,760
Baton to Owen

1930
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:33,344
Doesn't answer your question that we've had for a long time and that is food is he

1931
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,136
You feel is his Heir Apparent

1932
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,184
And obviously now we know that it's

1933
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:44,864
Glenn Beck

1934
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,656
He's got divorced goes out of business

1935
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
6 weeks

1936
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:54,080
That was just a six-month busy very generous if the reserves

1937
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
Rrd

1938
01:30:55,104 --> 01:31:00,480
Oh yeah I mean just imagine the day one or no the week one Revenue drop

1939
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,760
Would be

1940
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:02,784
Staggering

1941
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:06,880
Week 2 cuz I think there would be like some

1942
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:13,280
Shiny new car kinda feel like first week

1943
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,560
Odo

1944
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,352
Well we already know Zike

1945
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:19,168
Whenever it's not Alex

1946
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:22,496
And it doesn't we don't need any special information for this

1947
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,520
What is not Alex

1948
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,800
They're not telling s***

1949
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:28,640
No and the numbers you can even see unlike banned. Video Drop

1950
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,200
Dramatically from Alex's shows

1951
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,736
To the other shows

1952
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,576
And there are no real if there's no interest

1953
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,392
I'm on radio stations to send to Kate

1954
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,160
Norwinds

1955
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:43,488
War room nor is there any interest in the American Journal

1956
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,792
Yep the Dorito

1957
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,560
Drops

1958
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,352
So f****** hard

1959
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,168
Owen doesn't have any real handle on

1960
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:55,264
Some of the stuff that gives Alex plausible deniability which is

1961
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,104
The historical tradition of anti-communism

1962
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,128
I am

1963
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,664
Ibiza far-right

1964
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,224
People write baked in that world

1965
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,784
He came out of that from the John Birch

1966
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
Society

1967
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:13,952
And because of that you can rattle off all kinds of nonsense about Cecil Rhodes and what have you that make you think

1968
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:19,840
But he knows this s*** backwards and forwards doesn't he can yell at people he thinks are cut

1969
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,400
That's what I can do if it's so weird

1970
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,680
To say this

1971
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,216
But Owen

1972
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,264
Is just too shallow

1973
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:33,920
Exactly

1974
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:37,248
There's a presentation of of something

1975
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
Can you

1976
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,320
F****** imagine Owen

1977
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:44,160
To get on the show at doing that I've been beyond God's Consciousness nonsense

1978
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,696
The f*** out of here

1979
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,536
Wouldn't be able to Intrigue the audience at all in the

1980
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,072
Dumb s*** that Alex does

1981
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,376
It's a recipe for disaster but I think it's

1982
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
F****** hilarious

1983
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,216
Is that the thing

1984
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,520
It'll be like okay now I can retire is

1985
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:02,080
If Glenn Beck is doing a good enough job

1986
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:07,200
Tell that to yourself a 2009 you dumbass hole tell that to yourself honestly

1987
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,992
Now in the mirror

1988
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:13,856
And say it's like I just want Alex to really look in the mirror one time and just be like

1989
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,672
Glenn Beck is who I want to be

1990
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:23,072
Glenn Beck will climb back will finish my work. My standard

1991
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,352
To the Future

1992
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,656
Crying Glenn Beck live

1993
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,728
Dumb chalkboard one guy who's a steady hand

1994
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:35,360
No the only way they work is like completely

1995
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,920
Like what if Alex leaves

1996
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
Infowars has to be like okay

1997
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:42,016
We have to distance ourselves or Alex

1998
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,320
They are probably the only way

1999
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:47,136
But I don't think there's any real space in the market

2000
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:53,536
It for that note I think our funding goes away and so the one thing that makes them special also goes away which is the

2001
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
High production value

2002
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:59,424
And the appearance that similar enough to an actual news station

2003
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,592
I don't think anyone cares about a web show that Harrison Smith does

2004
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
Or Owen

2005
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:11,968
Do you like Harrison Smith alone in his room with a painting that isn't hung up

2006
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,248
What kind of audience

2007
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,552
Decrease the David Knight

2008
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:20,672
Experience when he left and started doing his own videos on Tik-Tok over the f****** light on

2009
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,696
Adorable

2010
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:26,304
It's that that will be sir it will be all of their futures

2011
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,840
Linda Glenn Beck

2012
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Is

2013
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,144
I mean

2014
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,216
He's just a dick who goes wherever the money is

2015
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,496
And the money is in this

2016
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,264
Extremist

2017
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,848
It's similar to Alex right now

2018
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:45,248
On the exact same page and like all Alex you woke me up or whatever the f*** play a different area 5 years

2019
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:48,064
I tried to go there as soon as this this

2020
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,160
Tide changes if it changes will be back Tuesday and like you know who's great

2021
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:58,560
Yep Mitt Romney you got it I was never on board with all those extreme actually I was and I'd like to apologize

2022
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:03,680
I'm so sorry you don't press campaign apologize.

2023
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:06,752
You will never admit they're wrong I'll admit I'm wrong twice

2024
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:13,152
And then I'll do it again baby Alex's real actual desperation to not do

2025
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,176
Do this anymore

2026
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,224
I can't believe so many people still work

2027
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,248
What are the ratings on the

2028
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:23,136
Man trying to kill all of you by giving you covid and I want to leave

2029
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,416
I want to quit

2030
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,184
I hate

2031
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:25,952
Wow

2032
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:30,560
So over the weekend there was a interview at the end of last week

2033
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:33,120
Interview that Melinda Gates

2034
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:33,888
Stead

2035
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:39,008
What show was on but you talked about how evil Epstein

2036
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,336
Sure isn't Alex is really excited about the

2037
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:48,736
My ex-husband's buddy real piece of s***

2038
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:53,344
Really excited right on time lady

2039
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:00,000
You know you got to give her the benefit of the doubt and I like

2040
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:02,048
And I said she's distancing herself

2041
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,328
And they are

2042
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,120
Splitting off the foundation

2043
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,656
And they're putting

2044
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,704
McCullough said that

2045
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,008
Mercola. McCullough

2046
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,824
His Halo bendy Angel and buying off the

2047
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,128
Comedian spend billions a year to control the Press

2048
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,920
Medical news in underwriting

2049
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,712
Nbcnews

2050
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,992
CNN MSNBC

2051
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,272
You name it

2052
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,344
But they're moving the hell out of her

2053
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,648
But I said if she comes out and actually

2054
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,416
Ataxia

2055
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,464
It says Jeffrey Epstein is evil

2056
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,280
When says Jeffrey Epstein was a mollusk

2057
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,840
And says this is part of a satanic system

2058
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,376
Then she's not part of it

2059
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,144
And we should

2060
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,424
Say she's evil

2061
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,960
If she comes out

2062
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
Pulling in attack

2063
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Text Gage

2064
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,800
For being part of Epstein admit stats

2065
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,568
Are the reason

2066
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,872
She did it last week on

2067
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,640
CBS News

2068
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,456
Show people need to give her the benefit of the doubt

2069
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,016
We've never gotten information if she's even Genesis

2070
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,808
We've never gotten information

2071
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,832
Child molester

2072
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,880
What

2073
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:02,720
I think it's really nice that Alex has given Melinda Gates benefit of the doubt like

2074
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:08,352
I have this vague memory of something that Alex had in the past

2075
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,376
I have been

2076
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,264
His wife knew years ago in Germany

2077
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,312
Shadows of you

2078
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:23,712
We're running a worldwide

2079
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:30,368
We're stopping her from saving people know it was a public

2080
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,160
Alright

2081
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:38,816
So we have no evidence of public death threat really

2082
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,120
Hold on another memory

2083
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,944
People

2084
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:00,576
What you just think like we don't know how dangerous it is to go up against ya'll home I got you threatened does oh my God

2085
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,112
Scared now

2086
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,672
I think we're stupid they keep going

2087
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:07,232
I should back off

2088
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,560
Shell out

2089
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
Killing everybody

2090
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,376
Show up

2091
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,936
With a bunch of demons

2092
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,728
Hell no

2093
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,848
Are you pretending happened pretty seriously but this is also a little unnerving

2094
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,408
Melinda Gates is a demon

2095
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,944
According to Alex in the past

2096
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:30,528
That's still kind of vague you know he's really talk about a group of

2097
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,648
Sweet baby meant that she was like a really cool person who's making death threats on behalf of a group of demon

2098
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:38,464
Another memory

2099
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:45,888
Something very interesting happened crystallized

2100
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
Melinda Gates

2101
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,728
Went on today

2102
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,800
Good morning shows

2103
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Wearing

2104
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,360
Upside-down cross

2105
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:59,456
Oh

2106
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,992
Give her the benefit of the doubt

2107
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:04,064
That doesn't mean affiliation with the Church of Satan

2108
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,368
Because they supposedly the authorities

2109
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
With them

2110
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,928
And they said is she a Satanist

2111
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:09,696
I'm not kidding

2112
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,512
Oh well

2113
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,840
Upside-down cross

2114
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,912
Isn't necessarily affiliated with

2115
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:19,936
And

2116
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,472
We blown it up

2117
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,752
When I say some shots of that

2118
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,776
Coming up

2119
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
In the

2120
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:28,384
Last segment of the shower and it is an upside-down cross

2121
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,664
Sure there is.

2122
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
With a

2123
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,528
Ring of rubies around it

2124
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,952
I went and did some research and I sent it over to the producer this morning

2125
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,232
Today

2126
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:46,048
I didn't get my full stack them to resend it to the new producer

2127
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:50,144
Do you actually wear that someone comes from I said where am I seeing

2128
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,192
Upside-down cross with a

2129
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
Red

2130
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
Coronavirus

2131
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,056
And that where I thought I'd seen

2132
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,336
Very

2133
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,616
Horrible sign

2134
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,432
Symbolizes the death of the son

2135
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,648
As you can get

2136
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:17,280
How to such a fuking idiot nothing means anything on this show because you just making things up to suit whatever is convenient

2137
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
Troyman the moment

2138
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:24,960
Melinda Gates is presumably happy to Bill I'm a happily married to bill then she's a part of the Demonic cabal and it may be the worst of them all

2139
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:28,032
Jewelry

2140
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:32,128
Great fun game that only gets disrupted when she's getting divorced

2141
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,688
From Bell and his critical of his association with Epstein

2142
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:38,784
And that two of your narratives are running into each other in a way that shouldn't be happening

2143
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,832
If you're well do mean anything

2144
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,112
What do you do then

2145
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
That's simple

2146
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:45,696
He is pretending you never said all the stuff you said in the past

2147
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:52,096
No evidence that she's all evil and what-have-you in May 2020

2148
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:58,496
Necklace is a deep satanic messages was putting out on The Today Show

2149
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,824
And ensure she was married to bill for a long time

2150
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:06,432
I'm sure she's been heavily involved in the Gates Foundation for a long time

2151
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,480
I'm sure those things are

2152
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,272
Fundamentally work

2153
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,296
Looking for the devil

2154
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,064
Right

2155
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,600
We don't know that you

2156
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,904
Wanted to work for the devil

2157
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,696
Maybe she was being held captive

2158
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:24,096
Divide the billions of dollars that she had you know maybe someone forced her to wear that on upside-down cross

2159
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,960
Tower of gold

2160
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,008
All right I just thought there was stupid

2161
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:36,896
He's trying to rehab Her Image because the narrative now is

2162
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:43,296
Like hey if people are trying to defect over to the Patriot side let's give him a chance

2163
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,576
Mine is going to be the cheese

2164
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,112
Trying to become

2165
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:46,880
My Galaxy

2166
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,928
Never seen anything so dumb

2167
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,720
So Alex does a does

2168
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:54,560
I will say surprisingly few ads

2169
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:57,632
On this side episode but he has one

2170
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,680
And this is this is 2 minutes long

2171
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,496
This is a sales pitch

2172
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:07,616
Where he is legitimately just describing a bad business model

2173
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,176
I'm in a catch-22 and I'll try this

2174
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,248
We can sell

2175
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:16,064
Enough wintersun

2176
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,088
Enough

2177
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
Rainforest Ultra

2178
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,184
Enough X2 + x 3

2179
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:24,000
Defender operation and stay the same size

2180
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:26,816
And fight off a Democrat lawsuits by Rasmussen

2181
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,120
If we could get the

2182
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:29,888
These products

2183
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,656
In stock

2184
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,752
But they're routinely sold out

2185
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,544
On average more than six months

2186
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
And here's the Catch 22

2187
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,408
You want to sell them at full price

2188
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:45,760
Weed on the map

2189
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,040
25% off

2190
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,112
People are habituated where I always sell stuff

2191
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:50,880
The 30-40

2192
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,648
40% off

2193
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,672
Some people wait

2194
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,440
Until that happens

2195
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,720
Then I so out of it

2196
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,512
Quicker but don't make enough money back

2197
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,792
Vallarta Market

2198
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:04,448
Should you be explaining this to me such high-quality stop at Cinema won't adulterate I won't cut the quality

2199
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,288
It's a lot of our best friends are now

2200
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,848
Not available anymore we have to discontinue

2201
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,128
Cuz you just can't get the product

2202
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,712
The price is going up

2203
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,248
Supply chains broken down

2204
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,784
I don't want to go up in price

2205
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,320
Anna buy discounted

2206
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,112
People buy it if I don't

2207
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,648
People don't buy it

2208
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,744
Like 2 weeks ago I go well

2209
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,280
I'm going to stop offering Tabitha

2210
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,048
50% off

2211
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:35,424
But then I talked to the account when they go will he really need to move all this

2212
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,704
Percent off

2213
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,544
Just don't forget money into be able to buy more that's coming in in 15 20 weeks

2214
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,152
And so we're doing this math

2215
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,688
Stop trying to figure out

2216
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,736
What we do

2217
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
Decision right now

2218
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,856
We're going to sell

2219
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,416
Down to just a few thousand bottles of each

2220
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,952
A few hundred bottles of

2221
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,512
Of all these products

2222
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,280
Watch and then hits

2223
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,048
Force

2224
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,864
The biggest sale we're going to do on these 25

2225
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,680
Because again Supply Chain break down all of it

2226
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,264
Cost of goods going up we we cannot discount

2227
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,288
At 40 or 50

2228
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,312
Percent off anymore

2229
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:17,920
He said that like over and over again I can't

2230
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,528
I hear this stuff I'm sick I'm going to look for my stuff elsewhere

2231
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,344
This is not this is this doesn't Inspire confidence

2232
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,440
It's not a catch-22 your options are both failing

2233
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,976
That's that

2234
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,304
Catch 22 that's just you you're going to fail

2235
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,376
Right if you do this you fail and if you do that you fail

2236
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:41,216
If this description of what's going on with his businesses in any way accurate

2237
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,264
It's like they're going out of business

2238
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,568
It's just an avitable eventually

2239
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,104
Start long enough time frame

2240
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,152
You're going to bleed yourself dry

2241
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:52,224
And if I were an investor listening to that I would be like

2242
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,504
This is a failure

2243
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,552
I would not want to get involved with this

2244
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Owen

2245
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,880
Do you want to take over a failing business

2246
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:04,000
Just so you know and I want to say this to any future investors or anybody wants to buy a product

2247
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:10,400
All right we we we are going out of business what we shot ourselves in the foot because we do these ridiculous sales

2248
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,424
In order to have a

2249
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,472
Money bhavesh well affresh

2250
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:17,312
Of money coming in

2251
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:22,432
I think people recognize that our products are fine but they're certainly not worth paying more than

2252
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:27,808
40% off for and so they eventually I'll give in and

2253
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:30,624
And do those sales and so we can't make enough money to do it

2254
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,928
We're doing good

2255
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:35,232
Listen I just want to tell you that this business

2256
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Operating the red

2257
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,304
And it will never know

2258
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,096
So if you want to visit

2259
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:47,008
That you continually have to put money into that you will never get back it could operate out of the rug out of business

2260
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:53,408
Operate out of the red if Alex could sell these things for 10% off but the audience won't buy them for that

2261
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,712
See that's not a catch-22 that they failure

2262
01:45:55,968 --> 01:46:02,112
I don't know if it's necessarily a function of the audience getting used to him having these sales

2263
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
As much as it is

2264
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:09,792
10% off prices for it's not that doesn't

2265
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,096
They can get it cheaper elsewhere

2266
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:17,216
Elachi maybe they'll pay a little bit more right by from Infowars

2267
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,008
But not a lot more nope

2268
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,056
Yeah you're f***** your f*****

2269
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,640
Good actor

2270
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,432
So Alex starts.

2271
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,968
More about the Russia Ukraine

2272
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,760
Great situation

2273
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,296
Things are always smarter so good

2274
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:34,112
Back in the Trap days

2275
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:37,184
People would talk about Alex being a Russian agent question

2276
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,464
And so on

2277
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,744
Decided back then

2278
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,536
He was going to go to Russia

2279
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
The troll

2280
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:46,144
And Alex is something that's a little bit of a revelation

2281
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,424
In terms of the

2282
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,960
I was going to go to Russia

2283
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,984
4 years ago

2284
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:54,080
Do interviews and live feeds and get mass of yours

2285
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
Start

2286
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:59,456
When I put out my passport on Twitter they said look he's a Russian agent

2287
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:01,760
Democrats up on the hill say

2288
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,320
We should investigate Alex Jones he's got a Russian visa

2289
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,344
Real quick

2290
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,136
That was a fake Visa

2291
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:11,232
Passport

2292
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,256
That's it it wasn't

2293
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,792
Anybody

2294
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,584
Could get if you're in the media want to go over there

2295
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,936
They called Tucker Carlson a Russian agent

2296
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:22,240
For wanting an interview with Vladimir Putin

2297
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,264
But everybody else

2298
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,824
Interview Vladimir Putin from The New York Times

2299
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,616
We're seeing in but he can't

2300
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,640
Fox News

2301
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,664
It's how they

2302
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,944
Handicap everybody

2303
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,968
Were you can't

2304
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:32,992
Even

2305
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:37,600
By the way I had them to the Russian media

2306
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,648
Duarte we sent an email saying

2307
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
Yes

2308
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,440
If you want to fly to the

2309
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,232
These mountains may be on this date

2310
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
You'll have a press

2311
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,280
Junket and you might

2312
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,816
Get one question and while he's hunting

2313
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,096
We were going to go interview

2314
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,120
I'm going to go do that

2315
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,912
Estimating it one question in a potent

2316
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,960
I'm sure be sure

2317
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:53,984
Cool

2318
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
Mountain in the urals Wiley

2319
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,824
Hunting god-knows-what but no I did

2320
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
Go to that

2321
01:47:59,360 --> 01:47:59,872
But I don't want to

2322
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:06,016
Go to Russia to be a Russian agent I wanted to go to Russia cuz I want to go to Egypt I want to go to Israel

2323
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,808
I want to go to Easter Island

2324
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,112
I want to go to Alaska

2325
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:16,512
Supporting Putin the way he is he might be able to visit Alaska and Russia at the same time

2326
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:21,376
Yeah I also stay the f*** out of Easter Island you a******

2327
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:23,424
Play you can't run dance holy Island

2328
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,960
No

2329
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:28,544
That the thing Motu is that I think Alex might be making

2330
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
Too little of this

2331
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,360
Notion of being offered

2332
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,384
To ask

2333
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:33,920
The question itself

2334
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:37,504
Mountain Resort's yeah that's kind of

2335
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,576
If true

2336
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:43,648
Real kind of Overture that's being made by

2337
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,928
The Russian media

2338
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:47,744
If true I really do feel like Alex would have

2339
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,280
Yeah yeah

2340
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:50,816
Yeah

2341
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,608
I mean he wants to

2342
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,144
You would at least get to stand

2343
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,424
Eli cologne

2344
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:01,824
Yeah or associate yourself in some way to have a clip of him asking Putin a

2345
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:08,224
A direct question and Putin responders about the globalist Alex you're a good boy

2346
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,248
We needed to hear.

2347
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:12,576
Russian TV show you started crying

2348
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:17,696
When they talked about how he was a great example of American man

2349
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:22,816
I have a good boy thank you I almost killed my dad last

2350
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584
Cheer

2351
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,400
Because I don't know

2352
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,448
I'm conflicted about what to believe about this

2353
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,008
Maybe

2354
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:37,408
Fell through or something this is Alex's way of saying like I didn't want to go at all

2355
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,200
Making it up entirely in this is how we make the

2356
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,736
Believable also possible

2357
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:44,064
Not sure it is weird though I mean if you put

2358
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,856
Contacts

2359
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,904
With other stories he's told about like

2360
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:51,488
Weird background stuff with Artie

2361
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:55,584
Possibly a government offering him a bunch of money through years ago

2362
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,656
That's there's such there's so many details

2363
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:02,496
Something sketchy here absolutely sketchy is going on

2364
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:05,056
Either Alex is making up a whole lot of stuff

2365
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:05,824
4

2366
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:09,152
There's there's some other details he needs to provide

2367
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:11,712
And the fact that they continue to

2368
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,736
Drop-in like

2369
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,760
Weird ways

2370
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,064
Unrelated to nest

2371
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,160
The Sara Lee what it is he's trying to say as almost like a little Bragg outside

2372
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,184
We're like

2373
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,232
That's you only do that whenever you

2374
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
Our kind of proud of something

2375
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:25,792
Something's going

2376
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:28,608
I don't know what to make of it but it's weird

2377
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,656
Alex doesn't like

2378
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
What's going on in Ukraine

2379
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,496
Murder

2380
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,264
But

2381
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,544
Right now there's nobody

2382
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,616
Add

2383
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,408
What I see out of Ukraine

2384
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,992
Now that Russia has invaded

2385
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,040
He's not good

2386
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,576
Ukraine has lied about

2387
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,344
Nuclear reactor

2388
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,232
There was no leak no extra radiation

2389
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,792
The Snake Island Massacre didn't happen

2390
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:00,352
It was all made up

2391
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,936
And almost everything coming out of zalenski's mouth

2392
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:05,216
Is a lie

2393
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,080
Spell I don't say that because I'm Pro poop

2394
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,872
I say that because I'm

2395
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:12,640
Protrude

2396
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,664
Okay

2397
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,968
And I Pro puto caveman

2398
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
I would say that this

2399
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,576
It's not being weighed with

2400
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:25,696
Eli's that Putin is telling from what I'm seeing out of Ukraine it's bad

2401
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:29,024
I'm the reason it's bad is because zielinski did not

2402
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,048
Tell the truth

2403
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,376
About how a nuclear reactor

2404
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,912
Did not melt down

2405
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,936
It was just

2406
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:38,240
Hit by large-scale

2407
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,776
Yeah

2408
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:41,056
I'm going to tell you

2409
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:47,456
That makes me think it's okay for Putin to go in there and murder millions of people I think that's total of

2410
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:51,040
Obviously this is the way that this is

2411
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,320
This is being used

2412
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,112
But I think it's

2413
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,904
Just an absolute coward

2414
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,184
Move to

2415
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,208
Say that

2416
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,280
Zelensky and Ukraine

2417
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,560
Just total Liars

2418
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,584
And then

2419
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,144
Do not discuss what lies are coming out of

2420
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:10,496
Like if you're going to pretend that you just care about the truth

2421
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:12,544
Then you need to give equal measure to

2422
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,312
Do both

2423
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:17,408
Sides of this supposed allies that are coming out of it and if you were

2424
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,176
To do that this

2425
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:22,016
Would be a four-hour Special Report

2426
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:26,112
Putin flies

2427
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:32,512
This lies in fact and the interest is in just branding the other side as Liars which is in service

2428
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:35,584
Service of supporting Putin without having

2429
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
To stand up

2430
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:38,400
And actually make that your position

2431
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,424
Because Alex is a

2432
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:44,288
F****** Tower it would be so terrible if you stood up and said I see

2433
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,056
Support Putin

2434
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,336
War of aggression against

2435
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,360
Ansa Sovereign Nation

2436
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,408
Because I am thoroughly ProPay

2437
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,176
Putin and I think

2438
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,968
He's going to murder my political and

2439
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,040
But I will say that Alex does kind of have

2440
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,320
A little bit of a

2441
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:57,088
The criticism

2442
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:57,856
Call

2443
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,672
I said this week ago I said looks like poop

2444
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,440
Putting in his

2445
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,464
Junior varsity

2446
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
Is conscript

2447
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,024
They have a draft over there

2448
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,304
Using a human

2449
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,584
Pull out

2450
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,120
The identities

2451
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:10,912
Replacements for Special Forces

2452
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,448
Of where the

2453
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,752
Ukrainian troops are so they can kill him

2454
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:16,288
And indeed that's what happened

2455
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,080
That's a nasty tax

2456
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,640
Sending in his

2457
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,712
Greenish cribs

2458
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,272
But it's and it's a desperate

2459
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:30,368
Alex didn't say that a week ago.

2460
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:34,464
Paid off the Ukrainian government was going to get zero resistance trying to take the country

2461
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:38,048
He also said that the Lansky was a double agent secretly working for Putin

2462
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,144
Is complete horseshit an example of his past position

2463
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,216
Make himself sound like he knows what he's talking about

2464
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:46,240
In hindsight

2465
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:50,848
Also if that's what I was really think spoons doing I think it deserves

2466
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:57,248
A little bit more of a rebuking what I'm hearing from Alex

2467
01:53:57,504 --> 01:54:03,648
Softball treat all right okay I think it's bad that Putin is sending complete children

2468
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:09,536
To die in order for him to kill more people

2469
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,376
Seems like a kid gloves

2470
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:15,936
IPad 2

2471
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:20,032
It's not I don't have any problem with a mask

2472
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:22,848
Again this is all in function of

2473
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:24,384
Supporting food in Whitehaven

2474
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,152
Cowardly

2475
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:32,832
Over yourself of pretending that that's not what you're doing it's just crazy to me that cowardly Shield

2476
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,880
Even still come off like a psychopath

2477
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:41,280
You know what would I think that if you're not engaging with it out with Alex is saying critically it doesn't come off like a psychopath

2478
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,304
Has the appearance

2479
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,352
And the delivery of someone who wants

2480
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
Be

2481
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:48,192
Passive listener and somebody's not engaging all that much

2482
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:51,520
I think he's looking all the angles

2483
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:54,080
He gets away with that with his audience

2484
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,896
But if you take the time to actually

2485
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,176
Listen to what you saying

2486
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:00,992
And ask yourself like why is he

2487
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,016
Is he saying this

2488
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,552
What is the point of this

2489
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:06,880
You get such a clear picture of like this is

2490
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,904
All just prudence

2491
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,952
Here's a great example.

2492
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:13,280
Like why would he throw this narrative in

2493
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:15,328
Did conversation about the situation

2494
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:17,376
Of Putin invading Ukraine

2495
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,936
And so I do want to be like the corporate media that's

2496
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:22,240
Says somebody said something and then not show it

2497
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,032
What's playing new clip that I had

2498
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:25,056
Seen until now

2499
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,336
I'd rather

2500
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
Is foundation

2501
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:28,384
Saying it

2502
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,408
And Fiona Hill

2503
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,944
Never shooting sad

2504
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,480
Where he brags and calls

2505
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:35,808
Eastern Europe in the caucuses

2506
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,112
And OMG Slavic Nations

2507
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,648
The border Russia

2508
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,208
Former Nazi

2509
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:43,488
Happy happy Hunting Ground

2510
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,304
Literally

2511
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:47,584
He calls it

2512
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,864
Thesaurus Empire

2513
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:49,888
Here it is

2514
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,520
When the Soviet Union

2515
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,568
The Soviet Empire

2516
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,616
Collapse

2517
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,384
Empire

2518
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,432
Collapse

2519
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,992
I've moved in

2520
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:05,760
And

2521
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,784
Picked up the pieces

2522
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,832
Ask question hungry

2523
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:11,136
And 1984

2524
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:15,232
And then pull into foot in the 87

2525
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,512
China Mac

2526
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,536
Just having this route

2527
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,400
So this is how

2528
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:26,240
What's up with the tsarist empire

2529
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,848
Replacing the Soviet

2530
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:36,224
How do you think you're doing in your Imperial ambitions

2531
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,088
There you go ladies and gentlemen

2532
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:45,184
Let's let's play that clip 1

2533
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,952
More

2534
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,720
Time

2535
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,256
Just everybody gets it

2536
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,304
Very clear and has no record so you can

2537
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,352
Puritas

2538
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:57,728
Play twice and it's not the laughter so it doesn't sound like he's very obviously making a joke

2539
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:00,032
Yeah it's so clear soda

2540
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:02,848
I mean that could not be more obviously a joke

2541
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:05,152
Well I guess he thinks he's the arch

2542
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:05,920
Sudoku

2543
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:07,200
Vampire

2544
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:07,968
I mean come on

2545
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:10,528
Ask yourself though Jordan what is the point

2546
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:13,856
Of playing that clip in the middle of a conversation about Putin invading

2547
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:14,624
Ukraine

2548
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,928
The only possible point you could be making

2549
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:19,232
Is the Putin is Justified and correct

2550
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:22,304
There's no other interpretation you can find

2551
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:28,704
In the context of Infowars I mean he's not trying to overthrow Ukraine he's trying to overthrow the wrong

2552
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
Empire

2553
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:35,872
Jose Rosas meddling

2554
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:40,224
These bio-weapon Labs at the United States

2555
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,808
2023 you're whatever I mean the funniest part about this

2556
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,368
This is right now he's so cowardly and trying to couch

2557
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,136
This differently

2558
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:50,976
I think he's going to wind up talking himself into being like I think

2559
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:57,376
I think once he has cover to do it yeah I would not be surprised

2560
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:59,424
Opus weirdo they clipped at the end

2561
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:04,800
So you can tell by where was cut off social media

2562
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:08,640
It's a 42-second clip that's going around being posted by weird Twitter account

2563
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,920
Mississippi making the argument

2564
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:10,688
The Putin

2565
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,456
Isn't wrong

2566
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,480
Invaded Ukraine

2567
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,016
Soros

2568
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:17,856
This is from a 2015 Cherokee gave at the Asia Society

2569
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:24,512
The full videos up on their website and if you want to you can go watch it it's clear if you do the Taurus is talk about finding organized

2570
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,280
Stations that work

2571
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:28,352
To promote democracy informally undemocratic

2572
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,888
Countries that's the whole point

2573
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:32,448
The chat

2574
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:35,776
The clip out of context if you didn't just get this little snippet Twitter

2575
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:38,336
I'm sorry to report on it like he knows what he's talking about

2576
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,104
And again

2577
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,408
There's no reason to introduce out of context

2578
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:43,712
Clip into the conversation unless

2579
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,736
You're trying to score

2580
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,016
100 no other funk

2581
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,064
No. Whatsoever no

2582
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:50,624
Sounds good

2583
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,928
Soros it becomes like a really long

2584
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:53,696
Soros

2585
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:55,232
Complaint session

2586
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,256
Sounds about right

2587
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,328
Unfortunately because of that

2588
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:03,424
I actually realized I don't agree with Alex

2589
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:09,568
About something that I thought we were in agreement about there were very few things that I thought we had like common cause

2590
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:15,968
Civil asset forfeiture b b in play

2591
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,736
Drugs

2592
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:21,088
And he has a list of things transgenderism

2593
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,624
Fluoride the water

2594
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,672
Weaponized marijuana all the screen

2595
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,720
Drug legalization

2596
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,280
People

2597
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:32,352
Cuz I don't think we should decriminalize drugs

2598
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,144
We should not legalize

2599
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,424
What

2600
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:37,984
Don't put people in prison for me on heroin or cocaine

2601
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,848
Then but Don't Legalize It

2602
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,128
Why do we get a dick

2603
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,176
You just

2604
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:47,712
Penalize

2605
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,992
The big the dealers

2606
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,016
You don't

2607
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:50,784
Pennywise

2608
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
The users

2609
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,856
Aeropostale legalized

2610
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:56,416
You're so blown and blasted out of your brain

2611
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,952
You know who you are so

2612
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:02,560
Wasn't incoherent position and I would say that it's really counter to his

2613
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:07,680
Fake libertarian ideology that he likes to pretend he has legalized drugs

2614
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,472
Analyze

2615
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:16,384
Well I mean yeah it's it's it's like Don't Legalize It decriminalize it except if you have enough that

2616
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:23,040
The government can make an argument that you're dealing it and that it's still criminal yeah I just think it's by degrees

2617
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:23,808
Still

2618
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,088
The same thing exactly

2619
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,880
This is a meaningless difference

2620
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,416
Fats are you suggesting

2621
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,256
I think it's dumb

2622
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:35,584
Play my heartbreak

2623
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:36,608
But like

2624
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,400
It does bum me out

2625
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:42,496
When there are things are like well at least he's on the right side of this

2626
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:45,824
At least he's we can find some agreement

2627
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:51,200
Criminalization illegalization

2628
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,224
Of drugs

2629
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,504
The drug war itself

2630
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,272
Is

2631
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:57,856
A stupid waste of resources that has been used to

2632
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,648
Destroy communities

2633
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:03,488
That's that's not his his position

2634
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,792
And that sucks

2635
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,096
To criminalize

2636
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:08,864
Black people

2637
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:09,888
4

2638
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:16,288
Being sick about what intent to distribute laws have been traditionally only

2639
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:21,920
For good what's the line between personal use and intent to distribute

2640
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,504
10 grand

2641
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,600
MoneyGram friend of mine friend of mine back

2642
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:31,392
And we were like

2643
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:35,744
Now 18 19 or something he bought a trash bag full of weed

2644
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:36,768
One time

2645
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:40,864
And he did not intend to distribute 0.04 personally good weekend

2646
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,824
I think that

2647
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,104
It's so

2648
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,640
Transparent to anybody

2649
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,712
Experience with

2650
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:58,272
Drugs for anybody who thought about the

2651
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,040
Is for a while

2652
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:02,624
That the position that Alex is advocating for

2653
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,952
Lip service towards caring about

2654
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,720
Drug use

2655
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:09,280
Insulting that problem

2656
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,816
In reality it doesn't

2657
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:11,840
A table

2658
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:16,192
No one even reduce things it just be used if

2659
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:17,984
Shore points

2660
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,776
Also

2661
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:24,128
Transphobia that was inherited by Clippers well

2662
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,920
Like that noise

2663
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:31,296
He's got all these things he's trying to destroy the world with

2664
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:32,576
30 ft

2665
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,624
Thousands of DEA

2666
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,672
More than 20

2667
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:40,512
Attorney General

2668
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,536
Empower

2669
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,632
And if you're a conservative

2670
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
Anu

2671
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,192
You had two beers you're getting

2672
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,728
The book thrown at you

2673
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,752
For DWI

2674
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:56,896
I thought you are black lives matter person that shoots 5 people and kills them

2675
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,920
You're out the week

2676
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:03,808
Galaxy come up with any black lives matter person who got away with murder because of a saurus district attorney

2677
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:08,416
On the flip side Alex is actually an interesting Counterpoint to his own argument

2678
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:11,744
Seeing as though he got a DUI last year and he didn't go to jail

2679
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:18,656
Anything digging into Soros when he was setting out to have a conversation about Ukraine and Russia is super telling

2680
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:22,496
Who's the most cowardly weaselly way for him to support food without having

2681
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,640
By pretending talking about Soros his longtime anime

2682
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:32,224
Artery weeks from this a******

2683
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:39,904
I forever I told you maybe was before we started recording or maybe it was at the beginning of the episode of can't remember but I lost

2684
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,184
What's with this

2685
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,464
This episode end

2686
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:45,792
Don't worry we're coming to the point where I

2687
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:48,096
I ate just lost all

2688
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:49,376
Interesting that

2689
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,656
But you eat it's such a

2690
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,960
Trashout needs commercial breaks

2691
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:56,288
There's just not a Centrist position

2692
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:57,824
4

2693
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,592
Award

2694
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:01,408
If you are pulling this

2695
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,432
Bulshit

2696
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,456
About

2697
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:07,552
They're being like I both sides argument for Putin invading Ukraine

2698
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,344
Then your f****** dumb

2699
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,136
You're just running interference

2700
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,160
I saw your profile

2701
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,184
I think this

2702
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,976
I think that you can have

2703
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:15,744
Critiques

2704
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,280
And concerns

2705
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:21,888
About ways that Ukraine may be carrying out the defense of their own country

2706
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:25,984
I think there's room for that conversation

2707
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,776
Alex were having that

2708
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:29,312
I think that there would be a lot more

2709
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:30,336
Credence

2710
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,360
The things he's saying

2711
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:34,688
But he doesn't want to have that conversation cuz that doesn't justify The Invasion

2712
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:38,016
He's doing these things he's using be specific talk

2713
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,040
Pinpoints because

2714
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:41,856
There are ways that he can support Putin and Putin Zacks

2715
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:44,928
Without having the stink on him above

2716
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:47,744
Being the guy who's like hey you know what I love Putin

2717
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,280
Do you know who does do that though

2718
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,304
Nick Fuentes

2719
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,864
There you go who's on Alex's Network

2720
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,168
The channel on video straight up

2721
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:56,448
And at his

2722
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,728
Speech

2723
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,752
Straight up was like

2724
02:04:59,008 --> 02:04:59,520
Getting poop

2725
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:00,544
Dance going

2726
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:05,920
So that he's not willing to be out in public

2727
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,224
Even though his business is failing

2728
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:11,296
He still has something to maintain and protect

2729
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:15,136
Headlined by Putin

2730
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:18,208
And you'll notice he has to editorialize a little bit here

2731
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,024
Houghton sanctions are declaration of war

2732
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,816
No-fly zone warning Waze

2733
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:23,840
Cyber attacks

2734
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:24,864
Azelastine

2735
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,144
Engages in cyber-attacks again

2736
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:26,912
Russia

2737
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:30,496
The war Russia launches any cyber

2738
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:34,336
Very very dangerous

2739
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,104
Situation

2740
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,384
What else did is so true

2741
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,152
Transparent

2742
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:42,528
You read a headline that said the Putin's weighing a cyberattack and instinctively almost at second nature

2743
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,552
He pretended

2744
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:48,416
Extend a headline to say that Putin is being attacked

2745
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:54,816
Preparing a cyber-attack obviously the only reason he would do that is cuz he's under attack

2746
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,888
Supports Putin

2747
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:02,752
Clear but the other part is the poon's almost painfully intertwined with Alex's narratives at this point

2748
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:07,360
Really do much negative stuff about Putin Without Really tanking some of the plates

2749
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:08,384
He's trying to spend

2750
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:13,248
He's got this whole thing going about how class Rob is going to do a false flag cyber-attack so

2751
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:16,064
Alex accidentally read the headline about Boudicca

2752
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,600
Considering

2753
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:22,976
He's going to have to immediately invalidated or run the risk of weakening his Schwab narrative

2754
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:27,072
In order to keep his own bulshit afloat Alex's essentially required to give Putin

2755
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:27,840
Compassus

2756
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:28,864
A whole lot of stuff

2757
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,424
He has to pretend to not know a lot of stuff

2758
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:33,216
That's a lie about time to stuff

2759
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,496
Kind of

2760
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:36,800
Where is constrained by his own

2761
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,592
Machinations

2762
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,360
Teen holds him

2763
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:44,224
It constrains him to not being able to talk about certain things

2764
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:48,064
I mean you've set this guy up

2765
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:54,464
Who is very obviously evil to be the leader in the fight against the globalist right next to

2766
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:59,328
Trump so you have to say that committing war crimes in murdering people is fine

2767
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,144
Killing killing civilians

2768
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,680
And shelling

2769
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,472
Humanitarian corridors

2770
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:11,872
If you have to deny it by saying well what about the ghost of Ciara Ukraine is just liars absolutely

2771
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:16,992
Food weighing cyber-attack you like no no no no

2772
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,040
It's annoying

2773
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:20,064
It's

2774
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:20,832
OneNote

2775
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:23,136
It's very see-through

2776
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:26,208
And this is exactly where I decided

2777
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:28,000
Say how about you go fuc yourself

2778
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:30,816
It's not because of any negative contact it's just because

2779
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:32,864
Show is

2780
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:34,144
Trivial

2781
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,680
To a level that is

2782
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,960
Disrespectful

2783
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:38,752
To the issues that he's pretending a cover

2784
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,800
We are disputing

2785
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:43,104
More than four years ago

2786
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,384
Back on Trump

2787
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,688
1st and office they were calling us all Russian agents

2788
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:49,248
There's a restaurant

2789
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,272
Downtown office

2790
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,552
Why should I

2791
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:52,576
European Flair

2792
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,624
What's the name of that restaurant

2793
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:55,904
Russia House

2794
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,232
A cloakroom with

2795
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,792
Russian outfits and things

2796
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,560
Is a joke

2797
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:05,120
Theme party

2798
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:06,400
Pretty good food

2799
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:07,424
Adventure near

2800
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:08,960
Fine

2801
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:09,728
So we had a

2802
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,264
What was party there

2803
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:13,824
Are you can see some of the ladies

2804
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,592
Work here

2805
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,920
And smelly

2806
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,944
My camera on the table

2807
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:19,968
IPhone

2808
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:22,528
It was pretty

2809
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:23,808
Pretty funny there

2810
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:27,392
The media pick this up and said look he's a Russian

2811
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:29,184
Picking their viewers are so dumb

2812
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,744
And the Russians were insulted B and look at Jones

2813
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,536
Making fun of us to Saratoga National

2814
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:35,328
Russian TV but I think the rush

2815
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,096
Russian Sable

2816
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:37,376
Sense of humor so

2817
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:41,472
Corefirst kanarra really funny clip of Russian

2818
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,776
Russians trained with a bear

2819
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:48,128
And it's really funny the Bears like shaking the tree or the guy bounces up and down on it

2820
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,920
The Russians are known for taking

2821
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:54,272
Both are grizzly bears and other Bears couple species is a grizzly bear

2822
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:55,552
At pets

2823
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,368
And then so they've got one as a pet

2824
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,648
The playing with the soldiers

2825
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,720
And folks were joking that the other sister

2826
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:05,024
The Alex Jones in Rocky

2827
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:05,792
Before that was

2828
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:06,560
Between sad

2829
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:08,096
So here is the Russia

2830
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,632
I'm praying for the bear behind him

2831
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,912
Comic relief

2832
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,960
Animal play the next clip Alex Jones

2833
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:20,640
So first things first no one of the media covered Alex's dumped rolling video of him at that Russian restaurant talked about that

2834
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:25,504
Seriously I strongly doubt that anyone in Russia took offense to it either absolutely

2835
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:31,904
Is anyone in Russia ever saw that under closer surveillance than I would have thought

2836
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:39,072
Real awesome use of time on this emergency broadcast though like I can't believe you spent a half an hour talk about a stupid meme with the beginning

2837
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:42,400
Troll videos from like 4 years ago

2838
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:43,680
A f****** a******

2839
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:50,336
Video going around on like Tik-Tok and Twitter's and guys training with a bear

2840
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:55,456
Because Alex it's just another medium that he thinks is worth covering not a super important new show

2841
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:59,296
She gets done with playing these videos and then he says this Miz where I turned it off

2842
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:02,880
Only show you some memes that I thought was pretty informative that I saw

2843
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,904
No

2844
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:05,952
A cartoonist

2845
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,720
Photoshop

2846
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,000
What the f***

2847
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:09,536
Doing a meme Roundup

2848
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:12,096
Ideal imagine anything less

2849
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:14,912
Respectable in terms of a broadcast

2850
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,680
If this is

2851
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,960
Pasta to our point

2852
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:18,496
You set up to do two hours

2853
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,520
Just stop

2854
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:21,312
You don't need to do meme cover

2855
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:23,360
Every apparel

2856
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,408
America's racist home meme

2857
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,736
That's that's why I mean he's doing like

2858
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:30,272
Tosh 2.0 from me

2859
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:32,320
Beirut

2860
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,600
Barely

2861
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:36,416
Exactly

2862
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:40,768
Pun unintended celebrate

2863
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:41,792
Absolutely

2864
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:43,072
This sucks

2865
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:44,352
This

2866
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
I was

2867
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:49,216
Special Report

2868
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:50,240
Cuz it's trash

2869
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:52,288
I mean like the information that he's covering

2870
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:53,312
Thanks

2871
02:10:55,360 --> 02:11:00,480
These commercial breaks that's really add as somebody to listen to his shows so much

2872
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:02,784
Like that's one of things I Come Away with most

2873
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:03,808
Essentially it's like

2874
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:04,832
It's

2875
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,600
Awful

2876
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,904
To watch or listen to without

2877
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:10,464
It's just unsustainable

2878
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,792
Is commentary jumps around

2879
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:15,072
All over the place

2880
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:15,840
It's

2881
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,120
Meandering

2882
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:20,192
Yeah but how would you know

2883
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:21,728
If you hadn't listened to this way

2884
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:27,872
That the devil was currently trying to create a separate pocket Universe outside of God's wearing

2885
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:32,736
And there are other universes that Alex has been Chinese window bunch of them

2886
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:33,504
And

2887
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:34,272
Instead of

2888
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:40,672
A harp and having like The Illusionist think you do

2889
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:45,280
Oh well that is a choice you could probably think it's the only choice

2890
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:48,608
You can go to these pocket universes I don't want to problem

2891
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:49,888
I think

2892
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:50,912
Look

2893
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:56,288
Obviously unhinged and stupid but also so transparently

2894
02:11:57,568 --> 02:12:00,640
Trying to support Putin it away that he thinks is hedging

2895
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:02,432
His position to make it not

2896
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:04,224
Something they could be damaging to him

2897
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,016
Should the people call him on

2898
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:08,832
Yep I think that sucks I think I think it's

2899
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:10,368
I think it's

2900
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:12,160
I think that

2901
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:13,184
You should just

2902
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,720
That come out with it already

2903
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:17,024
Nope and let the chips fall where they may

2904
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:20,864
Stand up for the things that you obviously support

2905
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,192
If you're running interference for Putin

2906
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,728
Your pro-putin

2907
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:27,520
That's how it work

2908
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:34,176
Right you can't just say like I don't take sides in this war

2909
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:34,944
Of

2910
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,224
Like

2911
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:39,040
Why Ukraine is right

2912
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:41,600
Why is what are the things

2913
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:42,368
Does that make

2914
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,904
Ukraine correcting the situation

2915
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:44,928
It is only

2916
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:49,792
Zama's liars and zelensky the liar

2917
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:53,888
And these is right

2918
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,680
Yep that's the only coverage

2919
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:56,704
That really is

2920
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,496
At all put forth on this

2921
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:01,568
Also applying his

2922
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:03,360
Standard villains like Soros

2923
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:05,664
Ways to communicate

2924
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,200
Why Putin is right

2925
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:11,040
It's not it's not that he supports Putin's invasion

2926
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:17,696
However George Soros invaded already so it's like why it's not really invading he's on invading honestly

2927
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:24,096
That's what it is right in the wrong I mean I don't even know why Ukraine's fighting back it's it it's not like they're that it's not

2928
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:25,888
Putin trying to take over there

2929
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,424
He's trying to give it back

2930
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,192
To them

2931
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:29,472
You know what Dan

2932
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:32,800
Like America before him Putin's just deliberate

2933
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:35,360
Is liberating listings

2934
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:37,920
Yep covid narrative sucks sucks butts

2935
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:42,016
Sad part about all of it is

2936
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,296
Memes

2937
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:44,064
No

2938
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,624
Glenn Beck

2939
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:51,488
That's pretty sad than framing a meme

2940
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:55,072
Yeah they specially a meme is

2941
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:55,840
Part of

2942
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:59,936
I mean Trend that's making fun of people like you

2943
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:03,520
That's that's pretty sad listening to this

2944
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:09,920
Which I assume he is Glenn all world leaders wind-up listening to the show bedroom

2945
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:13,760
I would just say that if you are sadder than a framed meme

2946
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:15,040
You should really think about

2947
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:16,064
Yeah

2948
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:20,672
