Oh wow

15
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,344
Yeah I think it's probably something to do with my dad

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Like growing up

17
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
Some of the things he really like

Swedish

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
I like

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
Swedish Fish my dad like Swedish fish but also he was a big fan of like

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
The pan and that one

Karaoke I don't like marzipan

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,568
But Swedish Fish are fine

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
Of a Swedish Fish and Friends

25
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
That was excited to make friends

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Do fishes make friends

27
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Awake too long

28
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,112
There are new flavors

29
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
There's a strawberry dolphin and a watermelon turtle

30
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
Parsley the original is better

31
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
That's great

32
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
Defensive today I really Norwegian turtle

Happy

34

My bright spot is that boy

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
It's Saturday at the that I'm not I don't have to lie to any trial

36
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,464
How do I bright spot yeah that is true you get the day off

37
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
Just as I type a lot it's really hard

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
It hurts your feet

39
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Yeah I don't know how you do it

40
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
I wrote I think

41
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,800
Twenty thousand words yesterday

42
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:57,408
In the book

43
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
So yeah

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
Three of those hangers soft and gentle all day

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Well

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,048
I'm happy for you text

47
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Get ready for Monday the Bruce Lee two-finger push that you're right I got to step up my game

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Do Jordan

49
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
Today

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
We are doing

51
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,664
The thing that we have to do and that is the follow-up

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Up to Alex's War

53
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Our coverage of that

54
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
After the premiere of that

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Film

56
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
They did a little qna

57
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,464
Where Glenn Greenwald interviewed Alex Jones and Alex

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
Documentarian

59
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
I do Direct

60
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Activist film

61
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
They did not have

62
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
It's really working in the sound is really terrible for the portion where Moyer was interviewed

63
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
About any of that

64
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
I would be

65
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
Maybe not actually maybe it's best to not know exactly how that interview went

66
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
Right so we just got Alex's junk

67
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
And honestly it's like

68
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
40-something minutes

69
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
Sullivan interview and

70
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
I mean it sucks

71
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
But it's going to take more than 40 minutes

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Talk about

73
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm surprised

74
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Fairly certain

75
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
So how are your feelings going in

76
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,239
My feeling is that it's going to be Glenn Greenwald

77
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,615
Doing the softball Lisa vanderveer like not even softball questions not

78
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
Tee-ball question

79
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,711
Seems like he's swinging the bat for Alex

80
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
To try and get that ball across the f******

81
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
That's what I feel

82
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
We'll see if that lives up to your expectations

83
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Okay

84
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
So what before we get into

85
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
The actual interview I have two things I want to say

86
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
I've some comment

87
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
Excited

88
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
So I've been tracking some reactions

89
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
This new documentary about Alex

90
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
And I have to say

91
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
That I've just been seeing more and more s*** Tay

92
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,431
It's sincerely unbelievable to me that anyone could watch this film and come away except

93
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,503
The argument that the producers and director just showed Alex

94
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
As he is

95
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,391
That's such an offensive in gaslighting farce that I feel the need to address this again

96
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
And really sharpen the point that I make

97
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,863
On the day before the film was released Matt Taibbi publisher fawning interview with director Alex Lee Moyer on his Subs

98
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Any thinner duck

99
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Directions to the interview

100
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Quote

101
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,031
She takes characters reduced in panicked media treatments

102
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
The two dimensional

103
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Attitude dimensional monsters

104
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
And renders a non-judgmental totally edited

105
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,527
Bruce doggy and treatment of who

106
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
Who they are and how they came to be that way

107
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,951
This is absolute nonsense if I were Herzog I would not take kindly

108
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
To this kind of a suggestion

109
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
But I want to ask what

110
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
Exactly is meant by non judge

111
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Damental here

112
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
That seems like a really important concept to nail down because it's

113
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
Seems like this is something Moyer and the film's Defenders are real

114
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Really proud of being

115
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
I would guess that from the other things I've read non-judgmental to these folks means that they don't include critical

116
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Voices in their film

117
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,319
Provide any other input and then they pat themselves on the back

118
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Whole bunch

119
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
The courage to let the audio

120
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Decide what

121
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
About the subject of the film

122
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Guess

123
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
It's fine to not include critical voices in a film

124
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,911
But I really don't think that you're going to be able to say that you and tried to

125
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Portray your subject as they are

126
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
You're just portraying your subject how they want

127
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
You to see them

128
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,687
For example Alex lies constantly and contradicts himself about biographical information in this

129
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Spell

130
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,039
But you aren't introduced to somebody expressing that point in the film

131
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Do you have no reason to suspect

132
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Alex is being anything but on

133
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,463
The audience is being allowed to make up their own mind I guess

134
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
But their options are believing Alex

135
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
Or choosing not to

136
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,631
Which state have no reason to do based on the film they're watching

137
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,495
Another important point is that your editing the film according to the whim of your

138
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Jack which makes it nearly impossible

139
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,871
For an uninformed viewer to make up their mind for themselves

140
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,759
If you're watching this film nothing about it would give you any reason to distrust Alex's assertion

141
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
The only reason anyone was mad at him

142
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
About Sandy Hook

143
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Was because he

144
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Do you like Trump

145
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
And they needed something to smear him

146
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
There's no reason at all

147
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
From the material in this film to not conclude that

148
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Sandy Hook parents

149
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,935
Like Neil heslin or Scarlett Lewis who we've been in the courtroom with this week

150
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Or just

151
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
Tools of an overzealous Democratic machine

152
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
Desperately to punish Alex for supporting

153
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Drop

154
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
That assertion

155
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
That narrative

156
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
That Alex Telles

157
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
He's not presented as just

158
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
This guy is saying

159
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
The film is structured around defending that narrative

160
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
The only outcome

161
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,487
Of accepting lawyers claim that this is just non-judgemental and presenting Alex how he is

162
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,303
Would be the conclude that she either believes Alex's version

163
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Of this story

164
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,191
Or she edited her film in a way to strengthen the story fully aware

165
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
But it was full of s***

166
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,543
And is now bragging about how great she is for not indicating that the

167
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
The audience of maybe shouldn't trust this claim at all

168
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Odd

169
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,807
We've done this f****** stupid Dance all over like over and over again with idiots like Rogan who want to have their cake

170
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
Eat it too but then they also want pie

171
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
They want to talk to and platform dangerous lunatics

172
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Whitewash their images

173
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
I think don't want to be

174
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Criticized for it

175
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
And not only that

176
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
They want to be treated like a real heroes for Having the courage

177
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
To do what they do

178
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
And much like with Rogan

179
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
I don't buy that s***

180
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
From lawyer

181
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
If you're doing a documentary about a liar or a

182
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Con man

183
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,431
And you don't include any content critical of that liar Orkin man in your film

184
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
You aren't doing a documentary

185
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,575
The conman is using you as a medium to spread their message to an audio

186
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
They wouldn't have access to otherwise

187
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
You do have a responsibility

188
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
In that circumstance

189
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Whether you choose to accept it or not

190
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
To be totally clear

191
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
Here is more in her own words

192
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
On how she approaches her filmmaker

193
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
This is from that interview with Taibbi

194
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Quotes

195
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
This is what I'm going to

196
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,407
To do with all of the documentaries that I make by the way including the one I just made about Alex Jones

197
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
It's not meant to confirm your biases

198
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
It's meant to actually show you what these

199
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,599
These people are actually like and then you can make an informed

200
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
Decision based off watch

201
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Sing the film

202
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
Used to be called journalist

203
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
This was said in response to her telling a story about how she had investors not want to support her first film because she

204
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
You wouldn't include the voices of people who have been harmed

205
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,727
By misogynist in School shooters

206
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
We just met

207
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
Connect to Sonata critical voices of Alex

208
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
In this film

209
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
It is very real

210
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,479
She's kind of engaging in censorship here because guess what ding dong

211
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,319
A huge part of who Alex actually is and what he's actually like

212
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,695
Is that he knows that he's caused people an enormous amount of pain and he doesn't give a s***

213
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,255
By not giving voice to that and not

214
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Exploring that side of him

215
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,887
The kind of covering up that aspect of his psyche because it's inconvenient

216
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Probably too difficult of a subject

217
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Free to pull off in this

218
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
Softball ask documentary

219
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Now let me

220
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
Play focus on in on my point about Moyers approach

221
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
By applying it to a different

222
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
But let's imagine

223
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Alex is actually

224
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Could be called a fair portrait

225
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
Henry provided the audio

226
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
With enough information to make it informed

227
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Decision

228
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
I totally don't believe that

229
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,791
But that's going to be the standard that will apply to another situation

230
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
And see how it

231
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
Feels like they're really going to wish they hadn't said

232
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
I'm going to throw that out that you're right now I don't think it's going to go well for them I just don't think they're going to stand up to it that's just me

233
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,151
What would Warrior say about someone who made a documentary like hers but Jim Jones in like I don't know

234
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
1974

235
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,503
Right when he was forming Jonestown in Guyana

236
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:07,903
What is that person just let Jim Jones tell his own story lying the whole time with no pushback from

237
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
From the director or anyone in the film at all

238
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
You think the Jim Jones would be

239
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Able to spend

240
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
A pretty good yarn to be able to make the ID

241
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
Heading to his compound

242
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
Pretty decent idea

243
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,311
People were having a great time and he was spreading a real message of love and unity

244
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
The word of God

245
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Guys coming through

246
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
Now let's imagine further that this hypothetical documentarian knew that there were former members of the peoples Temple

247
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,135
Would left and allege that Jim Jones had abused them both physically and sexually

248
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Did people have come forward in LA

249
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
Did Jim Jones punish dissenters by starving them

250
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
And ostracizing them from socializing with the rest of

251
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
The community

252
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
This documentarian news those things but decided not

253
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Include any of them in the film because of a commitment

254
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Jim Jones

255
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
As you really are

256
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,175
Well and everybody knows that's when that happened all of those people who left

257
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
They were just hired by Carter

258
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,551
To smear Jim Jones everybody knew that

259
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:12,927
Now let's imagine that this hypothetical filmmaker edited together their documentary in such a way that

260
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
Swelling music

261
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
Play Dover hero shots of Jim Jones

262
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
And almost relive

263
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Religious soundscape service

264
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
Does the background for him talking about his religious Awakening

265
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
Spell let's imagine that this hypothetical filmmaker allowed Jim Jones

266
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Framing of his life

267
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,103
To inform the structure of their documentary and how the story was told

268
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
So like you were touching on

269
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
In this documentary

270
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,015
They do end up mentioning the allegations of abuse of his followers

271
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
But it's not brought up as a negative thing about him

272
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,695
It said it's only mentioned is something that Jim brushes off to the side as an attack from the power structure

273
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
Who were afraid of the religious Revolution that he was involved in

274
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
It is communist

275
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Indiana and the possibilities

276
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,215
Verapose I should have made a more extreme joke it said that was too obviously just what would have happened

277
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
Well that's the parallel documentary

278
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
The mass murder that ended Jonestown

279
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Happened

280
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,479
That's so maybe some edgy assholes of the day would say that this documentary filmmaker

281
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,831
Was just giving a non-judgmental view of this public figure who somewhat polarizing

282
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
And if I were somebody who study

283
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
Jim Jones back then

284
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,743
As I am somebody who studies Alex Jones right now

285
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
I would say that's complete

286
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Bulshit

287
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Bring Jim Jones it exactly the way

288
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
He wants to be portrayed with no,

289
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
Context and no countervailing information

290
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,543
He's very likely to leave viewers to adopt a more positive view of him

291
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
And that would be a dangerous thing

292
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
To be involved in

293
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Dan

294
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
I want to run through a brick wall for you right now

295
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
I want to bounce

296
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,087
My f****** ahead it gets like let's stop

297
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Record Exchange

298
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
Jim Jones

299
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
What's happen

300
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Right now

301
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,351
I'm sure that the rebuttal to this would be that Alex Jones is no Jim Jones

302
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
I am sure

303
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
He doesn't have a Jonestown

304
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,239
But you're delusional if you think that Alex doesn't pose as much

305
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
Potential danger is Jim Jones.

306
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,431
Approach your essentially legitimizing to figure your covering and making people more likely to

307
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
To follow them

308
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
And as we've seen over the course

309
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Doing the show

310
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,623
I went to the completely unhinged child unable to control his emotional outburst

311
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
Who constantly tells his audience

312
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,999
To keep a list of globalist in their town so they'll know who to kill when

313
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
The time comes

314
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
He's told his audience that it might be

315
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
Time to consider if you could

316
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
Kill your family members if they see

317
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Support vaccinations

318
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,519
Extols the message that psych meds or mind control weapon

319
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
Effective

320
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
Making people not seek mental health care or even worse

321
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Just stop taking medications that therefore

322
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Prescribed

323
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,039
Ask the people of Boston is Alex's actions have real-world consequences

324
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Have the people at the Sandy Hook victims

325
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Family member

326
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Ask the families

327
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
Igor soldo Allen Beck

328
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Joseph Wilcox

329
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,607
The three people who are murdered by Jared and Amanda Miller in 2014

330
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,959
Murders that were inspired by their anti-government views and which Jared had discussed

331
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Beforehand

332
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
On the Infowars forum

333
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Ask the family of tragic

334
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
Deceased Marcel Fontaine

335
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
These are stories that we know

336
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
And there'll be just the tip of the iceberg of the lives

337
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
I've been changed

338
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
Permanently by Alex's behaviors

339
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
And Alex doesn't

340
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Give a s***

341
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
He continues acting in the exact same ways that he did that led to

342
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
To these people's grief

343
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Because it's profitable

344
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,143
And these voices are ignored and disrespected in this documentary because

345
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
Actually covering Alex as he really

346
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
Is would be way too hard

347
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,847
I suspected it would have resulted in the kind of movie that lawyer wanted to make

348
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,991
I would have resulted in 710 episodes of some sort of

349
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
I think that might have Abby what that might be what would have happened

350
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,391
It definitely wouldn't have resulted in the sort of movie that you was looking for kids

351
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
Considering that at least two of the producers of this film

352
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
We're also producers of

353
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
Trump propaganda nonsense film

354
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
The plot against the president

355
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,679
Alex William boiler made a stupid and inaccurate film one that will fit

356
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
It's information that calls into question the subject

357
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
Self delivered image of himself

358
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
It's a bad movie and it will hurt

359
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
People but

360
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
It's her right to make it

361
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
I hope the money that you made doing it is worth

362
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
They put please spare me the sanctimonious

363
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Bulshit about how people

364
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Handle

365
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
That you do journalism

366
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,159
Your cut-rate editor producing semi-slick character study

367
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Not have Alex Jones

368
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
The person Alex Jones

369
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
He is

370
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,839
Basically yours Embark if you think what

371
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
This documentary shows is Alex as he really is

372
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,007
Also before we get into this Q&A I need to make one more point

373
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
Crystal clear

374
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
The framing that Moyer has about her own work

375
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
That isn't even real

376
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
She isn't interested in seeing the subject

377
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
It's as big as they are in this is some sort of Purity to it

378
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,671
And the most obvious hell is that she interviews Owen Shroyer Rob do and Mike Hansen in the documentary

379
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,511
They don't provide a glimpse into Alex as he really is

380
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Interviewing them doesn't

381
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,887
Just show Alex's to using what's an audience decide for themselves

382
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
They are included because they're sycophantic

383
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,031
Voices that aleko the self-aggrandizing narrative that Alex is telling about him

384
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,359
Which is the story that boiler wants to tell

385
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,479
Including interviews with people who glorify Alex's counter to her pretend ethos

386
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,063
It kind of makes a joke of her insistence of not interviewing critical voices

387
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
Pretense of journalistic purity

388
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
That is cut

389
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,511
Condescending mask she's wearing so she can elevator puff piece

390
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,095
Grand Rehabilitation project into some kind of active reporting

391
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
It's so brave that we can't even understand it

392
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,031
I reject that s*** entirely and it's really sad to see people with actual media careers

393
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Falling for this kind of an act

394
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
And I can't stress

395
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
That's enough

396
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
You would have more things

397
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
Put you some kind of an uncritical observer

398
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
Just dispassionately relaying the story of valak

399
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
She's deluded

400
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Do the Creator

401
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
And he's created

402
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,159
I'm Puttin biases are impossible not

403
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
I have an imp

404
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Princeton

405
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,583
In a piece about the movie's premiere in the New York Magazine these lines made me think

406
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Maybe she's not so

407
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
Impartial of a jacket

408
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Material issues

409
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
What might that be

410
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,031
Quote she watch the X-Files research serial killers

411
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
Conspiracies and generally respected misfit

412
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Disdain for Authority was normalize back then she says where is now people worship power in believe and toeing the line

413
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Line for the state

414
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Liberal Outlets

415
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,183
She thinks have unwittingly live credibility to figures like Jones thanks to their credulousness about official narrative

416
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:43,583
Calling conspiracy theories are just going to be news-item 6-month

417
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
It's from now she says

418
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,679
There were wmds covid came from a bath

419
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
This is just

420
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,799
Saying Alex's catchphrase in a lesson Commander

421
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Infowars

422
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
Tomorrow's news today

423
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Last bit of business

424
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
Glenn Greenwald has a penchant for run on set

425
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,831
So in order to prevent this Q&A and is fair of a light as possible

426
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
I've attempted to preserve as much of like

427
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
That as possible

428
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
Dammit

429
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,303
Some clips that are longer than I would like in Rambling the answering questions but I would rather risk

430
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
Annoying you

431
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
Being censorious

432
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
Just cuz I am not a very important person

433
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
Doesn't mean that I shouldn't

434
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
Be okay with you treating me like this

435
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Are you feeling

436
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
I mean

437
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Just it's just sad

438
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
It's so sad she sucks

439
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Like just

440
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,367
On a level of like

441
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
Quality like you just suck

442
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Play shity music

443
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
But it's not like she had good

444
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,071
Didn't have Radiohead or anything on there

445
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Boosted up

446
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
The documentary got a copyright strike

447
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
Without

448
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:58,335
Definitely just having Owen Shroyer on there a man who's literally a puppy

449
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
A selfie

450
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Yeah

451
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
The subject of the documentary what are you going to second

452
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
Wait a second like what what is Jeff Dunham's

453
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,647
Hand up a puppet ass going to say in a documentary about it is that okay

454
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Would say mean things

455
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
But that's not the point is going to say anything meaningful in the documentaries like William

456
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,911
Essentially unemployable in any other media so

457
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Situation

458
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:30,079
Stuck here I'm saddled with this absolute about my boss that right

459
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,431
Wall Alex's hand is right all the way up my ass controlling my mouth I'm going to be like

460
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
I think he might go to

461
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Too far sometimes

462
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
This is nonsense idea of that like

463
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
I'm just showing him as he is it's so

464
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
Keto diet

465
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
The fact that you sought out my cat

466
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,583
Alex akya his current employees are at the time current employees also

467
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,399
A dubious move

468
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
Inclusion in there is like

469
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Skip get off your f****** high horse

470
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
Pretending that

471
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,151
Input is Mike Hanson giving that shows Alex as he actually is right

472
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Nothing no

473
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
It's giving Mike Hansen

474
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
Impression of Alex

475
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
Which

476
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Is a positive one

477
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
You exclude all negative

478
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Impressions of Alec

479
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Because

480
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
You're not up to the task of telling that f******

481
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah

482
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,352
It is time together with what I'm learning during this whole f******

483
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
Experience down here is that

484
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
All of these people are f***

485
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Cowards

486
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
Who are afraid of anybody challenging them

487
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
And because they have a rabbit

488
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Fanbase that will

489
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Attack

490
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
People who do challenge them

491
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
A lot of people don't discover that their car

492
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,040
Stab this little group of people who

493
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
Them and keep them from ever having to

494
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Realized

495
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
That they're a bunch of

496
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
You f****** cowardly

497
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
Lee baby's no competence or quality at anything

498
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,584
I mean like Alex's 90 bodyguards

499
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Jesus Christ

500
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,680
Night there were bodyguards for

501
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:06,080
Nobody showing up to court at all you missed it you missed the best one whenever I left the other day

502
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
He went out he want to cross

503
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
What's the street to go get a hero or stuff it right

504
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,504
And his 10 bodyguards were surrounding him and they were doing

505
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,832
The funniest like Mission Impossible last Maneuvers like

506
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
People are checking the corner in like I got your

507
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,792
Marius there is no one there they're doing these Mission Impossible ass

508
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,096
Organizational moves it is

509
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
The f****** sad

510
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:35,520
Really long meeting before they go public about like all right we got to keep an eye out for milkshakes

511
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,640
Dakota and Alex get milk and no offense at all but one of his bodyguards is 5 ft

512
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:45,504
I'm not joking.

513
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,832
Bill up in the air whether or not

514
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:55,232
You'll never know it kinda looks like somebody from that Beastie Boys video

515
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
The size of Mike Ditka

516
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,816
His forehead is what I would like to describe it as

517
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,936
So without further Ado Jordan let's let's jump in on this Q&A

518
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
This is not going to not be

519
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
For you

520
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Anyway it starts

521
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Compliments

522
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
Already

523
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Alex has not yet on stage

524
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
So this is just Greenwald & Moyer

525
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Explaining what I thought

526
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Was never necessary deuce

527
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Language is

528
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
If you're a journalist for example going

529
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Speak to someone

530
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Without making clear whether you love that purr

531
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
I hate that person

532
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
But simply to try it on

533
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Understand them is kind of

534
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Fundamental to wipe

535
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Journalist

536
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Supposed to do and I think that's

537
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,960
The same for filmmakers and artists in.

538
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Cemetery entrance

539
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
The fact that you even have to explain yourself the fact

540
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Unusual

541
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
To watch a film

542
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Without

543
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
Constantly being bombarded with a

544
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
The filmmakers

545
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
Is moral perspective

546
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Testament to just how our process

547
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
The society is

548
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
Be calm and I really want to congratulate

549
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
You for resisting that and

550
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,184
We're kind of restoring what I think is

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
The purpose of

552
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
Art in journalism

553
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,072
In film documentary and nnn documentaries which is to

554
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Show the public

555
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Information

556
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
The payout of having

557
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
And let them decide what they think about it is

558
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
Supposed to shoving that

559
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Conclusion down there

560
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Facing

561
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
Life is a lot easier for you as I said if you would

562
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
Chosen a different route but I think

563
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Pixellot of Courage

564
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Free to do that and I think

565
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
So I want to congratulate

566
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Thanks Glenn

567
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
I feel like one of the defining characteristics of people you really shouldn't listen to our people that have a Mindless need to

568
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
To be an opposition

569
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Princeton

570
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,608
I think you're delusional if you don't think that Glenn

571
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,960
Bully for this documentary shows a portrait of Alex is in Subway

572
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,008
By the fact that all of the media voice

573
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
He doesn't like our saying it's

574
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Not

575
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,152
I think if you watch this film and you see that this is

576
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
Glenn's take

577
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
He's just a loser

578
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,552
This film isn't providing the information that people need to make an informed

579
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Decision

580
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,928
It's not just a dispassionate exercising journalism that people are

581
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
Just mad at because it doesn't include the requisite

582
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Performance of outrage

583
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
That's the line these ding dongs

584
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,888
Tell themselves so they can feel morally Superior to everyone else

585
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
Well they Trot out their exploitative vanity

586
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
The projects

587
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
Let's look at this idea of an in

588
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
Informed decision

589
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
I would argue that in order to make an informed

590
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
You need to have all the relevant

591
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Information about a sub

592
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,272
For instance it would be inappropriate for a pill to Market itself bikes

593
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Exclusively talking

594
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Think about the positive things that

595
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
I can do well completely neglect

596
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Sing the potential side effects

597
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Mexican hat

598
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,024
Similarly it wouldn't serve a person at all if the coverage of a pill Focus

599
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Entirely on the potential side

600
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
And ignored the thing that its effect

601
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Active entreating

602
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Either of these

603
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
Would give the person a lot of information about the

604
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
The pill in question

605
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
But neither would give them what they needed to make it in form

606
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Choice

607
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,432
It might give them the feeling that they have that informed choice

608
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
But the feeling is an illusion

609
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:02,112
This documentary does not give the viewers the information they need to make any kind of an informed decision about alley

610
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,744
In order for this film to actually be something that the viewer can watch and make up their own mind about

611
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,632
The viewer would need to already enter the film knowing that Alex is a liar and nothing he says can really be taking his

612
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Sincere

613
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,240
You already need to know that there's a reason not to trust him before

614
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
For you watch

615
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,824
And that's an absurd expectation to have for most

616
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
Viewers who are randomly coming into this

617
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
I talked to the people

618
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:31,296
Periodically and they're like what you do I got to do podcast by Alex who's that

619
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,464
Do you know he's not somebody who everyone knows about there's a lot of people have an uninformed opinion about him right

620
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
You go into this

621
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
Documentary

622
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,072
It all the information that he provides

623
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Is income

624
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
Yep that's a

625
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
Glenn thinks he knows who Alex is

626
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
Documentary provides

627
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,872
People he doesn't like don't like the movie so he's gung-ho by patting himself on the back

628
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
Congratulating more unattractive than the lighting

629
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Filmmaking

630
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,504
Basking in the wrong f****** delusion

631
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,832
And it was straight and how little they know about the subject that they're actually

632
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
I mean it's disgusting

633
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,512
I I can't imagine what her next film Mussolini of profile in Courage is going to be about but

634
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
I think I've heard that it shows a balance

635
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,400
View of Mussolini right up until 1941

636
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,216
Justin and he's a great guy

637
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,056
Not understood I think she'll need to over correct

638
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
I'd like to do some film about

639
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
Something

640
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Little Michael right-wing angry

641
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
Or something if she overcorrected to jump off a

642
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
So that's that's the wrong kind of overcorrected artistically overcorrected and

643
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Yeah I don't know

644
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
A puff piece about

645
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:49,120
Eco-terrorists or something like that I don't know

646
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
Well

647
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
Alex comes out here we are

648
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,128
Alright so do you want to end the weirdness of talking about Alex Jones

649
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
Right in front of him

650
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,224
If he's not here and bring them up on stage

651
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
Get up your AJ

652
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Does he have a mic

653
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Yeah he should have a night

654
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
We can share

655
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Usher

656
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
No I mean

657
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
I haven't asked

658
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
Operators attack

659
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,640
21 years old

660
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
And I but I meant everything purity

661
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,528
I made a lot of mistakes I'm a lot of bad stuff it wasn't on purpose

662
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
Greenwald

663
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Print figure with Alex Hoyer

664
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,208
And the thing is I didn't lie on purpose I made a lot of mistakes

665
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,024
But I'm not some person getting orders in line

666
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
And I want to get better

667
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Where I'm at

668
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
Glad you made it film

669
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
That just kind of shows what we've done cuz I look at it

670
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
Horrifying obnoxious

671
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,688
And then parts of it are good but I mean

672
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Anna

673
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
Deal of the day

674
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Like I did not lie to him on purpose

675
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
I didn't mean to say some purpose in

676
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
I'm glad you guys made it snow

677
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,792
So Alex I mean actually begin by asking you a little bit

678
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
About that in terms of your intention

679
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,680
So this is a good indication of how stilted this q&as

680
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,496
I need decent interviewer might hear that opening

681
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,080
Statement that Alex made and first say are you okay

682
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
And after clearing that up you would probably point out that

683
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Prompted

684
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,480
Alex just said that they

685
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,576
Didn't ever intentionally lie three times in about a minute

686
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:49,184
What kind of feels like somebody who lies intentionally really trying to stress that they don't

687
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Do that

688
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:55,328
Hey if your instinct isn't to follow up on that I guess you're just a better journalist than I can ever imagine being

689
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,424
Also weird not to latch onto that we are 90% accurate client

690
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:06,080
Seems like that's something they could stand to be explored like how do you quantify that does that actually mean anything or is that just an evasive

691
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Catchphrase

692
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
That you used to try to Dodge Ridge

693
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
Possibility for the horrible things you say

694
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Sure

695
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
When you're forgetting Shakespeare's Immortal line you know me thinks you can't

696
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
Possibly protest

697
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,208
Methinks you doth can't test it all

698
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
Why would you

699
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
You're too right all the time

700
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
I mean

701
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
What is majestic

702
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Are you on

703
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,984
So Glen Glenn has started into a quest

704
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
Here's where you go

705
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
And if you're expecting it to be like hey

706
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
Let me ask you about that

707
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,664
You say you don't lie

708
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
That's out

709
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,064
So Alex I mean actually begin by asking you a little bit

710
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,136
About that in terms of your intentions and end the lake be

711
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Because I

712
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
But I remember when I watched

713
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,024
The felony was just so striking this early footage of you and I remember when

714
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
When the internet person

715
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Discovered some of the early picture

716
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
Pictures of you from your Public Access days in Austin

717
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
I remember liberals being almost

718
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Was horrified liquid

719
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,496
Is cognitive dissonance like we're supposed to look at images

720
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
Screaming spitting monster and Yeti

721
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,336
These pictures are disturbing they handsome

722
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
And it's like very normal way you are now

723
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,064
Charisma a natural charisma

724
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
Even sat in the front

725
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
When you combine that your soul

726
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
You had when you were young

727
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Is a great question clearly

728
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,048
Had you been somebody who was willing to affirm rather than question established

729
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Heidi's

730
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
Could have ended up as like

731
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,144
A meteorologist on

732
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,448
My Good Morning America or like some Anderson

733
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Super tight

734
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
And I'm wondering

735
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
If you were aware of that but

736
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Angel

737
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
And purposely chose

738
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
To reject it for a

739
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Print out the sky

740
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Outcast that wears

741
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
Restaurant Dubai delightfully

742
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,856
Or whether it was just so natural to your personality.

743
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
You never even consider trying to tip

744
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
Anime

745
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
Acceptability

746
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
I was thinking about driving her today

747
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
So

748
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
That's where Glenn goes

749
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Baptist first question

750
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:14,848
Over Alex's three times in a minute that he doesn't lie on purpose but he's right 90% of the time

751
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,432
The open with a question predicated on how Alex was a handsome young man

752
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,760
This is just pathetic because track this question

753
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,672
It's basically asking did you make a conscious decision to not be as rich and famous as your talents would make you deserve

754
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Because

755
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,512
You were too invested in questioning the power structure

756
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:38,144
Is it just in your instinctual nature to be a rebel who questions the power structure

757
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
So the decision to not be super rich

758
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Famous wasn't even the decision

759
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:48,896
It's basically like are you so awesome by choice or by Nature you almost went too long

760
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,736
For me I would have gone with why is your dick so big

761
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,576
How did it get so big that is biggest

762
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
That's another reading of it

763
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
This s*** is embarrassing

764
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Partially

765
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,488
Cuz it's basically answered in the

766
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,072
The film but also because it kind of ignores the reality that

767
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,216
If I ever tried to get a job where he'd have a boss or advertisers that word a shady gold salesman

768
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Help book about where to hide guns

769
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
He wouldn't have lasted more than a month

770
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,920
He is talented but he's not that talented to the point where an employer would look past his

771
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
Stream oppositional-defiant

772
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
Because he's got the goods

773
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
He's no Howard Stern

774
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
Let's say

775
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
No no no no no

776
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,208
Is predicated on a false constructive what Alex

777
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Could and could not have done as a younger man

778
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Yes you was he

779
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Yes he was talented

780
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
But

781
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,168
He was also Alex Jones that whole time

782
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
If you take his story in the documentary at all seriously

783
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
You shouldn't have

784
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
To ask this question

785
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,664
Alex talks about how he got fired from a radio station cuz he wouldn't stop talking about Waco

786
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
Alex took the path

787
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
He did because it was

788
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,784
The only path of available to him that allowed him to

789
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
To satisfy his need for attention

790
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,880
A nobody to ever be able to tell him what

791
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
To do

792
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,256
Quite something really this Q&A was never going to be hard-hitting but

793
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
I didn't

794
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
Predicted open this flaccid

795
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
Here if you want to do that

796
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Beatles like Hey listen

797
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,520
You had that moment where there were two paths

798
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
Becoming a rock

799
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
God working grocery

800
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Are you know

801
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
What was it

802
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
That really turn that

803
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
And I would have been like hey Alec

804
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
You could have been a father of at least

805
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,296
Why didn't you become that

806
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:35,648
Eloquent doesn't know any list

807
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
Why did you become a

808
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Infowars

809
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:44,096
Excuse me have you ever heard your own story about your childhood why didn't you put it in this

810
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
F****** movie

811
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,424
I'm going to guess that Glenn's awareness of Alex

812
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,008
Starts and ends with things that are in this documentary and

813
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
The fact that everybody doesn't like him

814
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,944
And maybe a few of the like really

815
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Broad

816
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
The things that people know like he was against

817
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296
What's the Iraq War

818
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,368
He hates the establishment

819
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
M4

820
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,976
Gunn was for the Iraq War so is his buddy Tucker

821
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Weird

822
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,328
Anyway here is Alex's answer to that question of

823
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
Well it's actually how big that dick

824
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,496
Or whether it was just so natural to your personality that

825
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,800
You never even consider trying to

826
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
Except

827
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
Possibility

828
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
I was thinking about driving her today

829
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
What I wanted to say and I'm bitter

830
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
God you brought that up

831
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832
No no no church but now it's really intuitive

832
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,440
My enemies shall miss Lex Luthor Mastermind

833
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
And we do say that are a moron of that

834
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
I had no idea

835
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
Balto

836
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
And politics

837
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
And read like

838
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Books by

839
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,704
Did you make it with this key in like these were scary things

840
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,032
But I had no training no idea no plan

841
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,592
And this idea that like

842
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
A mastermind

843
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,664
It's in the shop

844
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
You know I am so

845
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Am I put myself down

846
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,136
He literally think I'm like this evil mastermind

847
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
And I literally can't

848
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Project book

849
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
And they're just like attacking me

850
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Constantly

851
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Where's the music

852
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
I might I'm just covering the news I was just my opinion

853
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
And so. I had no idea what I was doing

854
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
I just was

855
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
Okay

856
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Have a Libertarian like

857
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
Did like Republicans that like Democrats

858
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
And I was just watching

859
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
The TV

860
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,296
I tried to go to college and try to get rgf job

861
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
Disney Radio

862
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,720
That was it was basically

863
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
My mom political beliefs

864
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Lourdes pro-freedom

865
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,864
But I got involved it was immediately successful

866
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
That I was like

867
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
Trying to figure out is that when I'm trying to be truthful

868
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,288
But none of it was

869
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
None of it was murdered anybody

870
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,640
Yeah we talked about the mistakes for sure

871
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,664
In a few minutes

872
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Wouldn't be a complete

873
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Discussion

874
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Without that before we get to that

875
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Why

876
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
Why wouldn't I be a complete

877
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
Discussion

878
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,184
This isn't really an answer to Glenn's question but Glenn doesn't give a s***

879
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,768
In fairness I guess it's like a half answer with an answer to a

880
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
Completely different question mixed in

881
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
Also you might notice that Alexander been trampled by against

882
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,472
He never meant to lie and if you're Greenwald

883
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,032
The conscious choice to ignore that happening

884
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
So much

885
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,872
A neutral Observer would look at that behavior and say

886
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:42,272
This person really seems to be going out of his way to say that he doesn't lie on purpose and yet no one here is accused of

887
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,880
That seems like he's being super defensive about it maybe

888
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
If I want to have a folder

889
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Discussion

890
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,256
To check in on that glaring Dynamic that's playing out right

891
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
In front of me

892
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
I guess you could just ignore it

893
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
Empower 30 your next softball question though that's certainly another

894
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
I mean I'm so

895
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
F****** serious

896
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
Glad already

897
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Like it

898
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,360
It's like this is a dude who will go out of his way to

899
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
To try and destroy a young journalist career

900
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
School f******

901
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
Sick his sycophantic

902
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Bulshit

903
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
People on other

904
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
Destroy their lives then I'm going f******

905
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,648
Safe Alex you got the biggest dick in the world

906
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
How do you walk with a dick this big

907
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,768
It's so cute but he won't even f****** talk to me

908
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
You won't even block

909
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Me on Twitter

910
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Do you know why

911
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,424
Cuz I don't have any f****** restraints that young journalist she could lose her job

912
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
She called him a giant shitball f*****

913
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,312
But instead we are we are untethered from the establishment

914
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,616
You can't what do you do

915
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,528
You doesn't have anything to gain I do think there is a really funny thing and that you're mad that he won't play

916
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,672
I want him to because this means that he knows and he's just a coward he doesn't even have the guts to acknowledge

917
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:00,608
I didn't see this beauty somebody who tweeted at him

918
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
But they said that he should listen to our show

919
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
So believe me

920
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
You know you know

921
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
That's a little suspicious

922
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
So

923
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
Glenn out here is his next

924
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Question here

925
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,968
There's a little kernel of something

926
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,736
But in here actually

927
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
She already talked about the mistakes for sure

928
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
In a few minutes

929
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Wouldn't be a complete

930
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Discussion

931
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
Without that before we get to that

932
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
If you're polish

933
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Exciting

934
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
This is what was tracking

935
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Amy watching

936
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
The film is

937
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
There's a

938
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,704
You know if you have somebody with what political faction Radiology

939
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
What is Alex doing

940
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
And I'm watching

941
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Can you

942
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
I wonder why

943
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
People thought about doing it

944
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
Spreading huge amounts of Sceptre

945
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
The u.s.a.

946
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
FBI

947
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
Begin spreading that kind of

948
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:01,280
Is the man before Alex your warning about the

949
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
Dangers of exaggerating

950
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
The threats have been Laden

951
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,376
Al-Qaeda in order to kind of bring It

952
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Authority

953
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,752
Authoritarian and balanced

954
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,056
People very associated with the lab

955
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,360
I've been saying for a long time

956
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
2 Chainz

957
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
Authoritarianism warning about how big

958
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
White people's

959
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
Perception

960
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
The pop population in fear

961
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
How have you seen yourself

962
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Ideology

963
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Kaliyan NE

964
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
Politically linear

965
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
Alex was skeptical of all these organizations like the FBI and the CIA early on but there's also context it's missing for

966
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
From all of this

967
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
From Glen of malok themself

968
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
And certainly not from this film

969
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:49,152
Alex hated these groups not because of some kind of a principled opposition

970
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
And things like spying The Way Glen is framing the question

971
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
Alexander these group

972
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
Because of Waco Ruby rage in the Oklahoma City bombing

973
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:02,976
He distrusted them because after OKC the issue of right-wing militia violence was a high priority for law enforcement

974
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,536
Sirius Holt to the momentum that

975
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,840
The extreme-right was seeing in terms of organizing

976
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
It wasn't an opposition to the idea of spying or the FBI it was that Alex felt that they were focused on people who are too much

977
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
Like himself

978
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:21,408
Similarly his opposition to overhyping the threat of Bin Laden was also really just about his fears

979
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,968
About the government cracking down on far-right militia

980
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
He didn't oppose

981
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,808
Spying on like suspected Muslim terrorist for

982
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
He just thought it was a smoke

983
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
Scream to eventually spion

984
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,720
Christian nationalist extremist

985
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,048
Yeah I mean they might as well here's a better way of framing that question

986
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Alex

987
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
You opposed the FBI because

988
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
Cuz they're not solely out

989
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,192
To get non-white

990
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,496
How long has that been going on

991
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:52,895
I don't have no way to know any of that stuff cuz he didn't prepare for this interview at all he doesn't know any

992
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,967
Nothing except for like a

993
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
It's not an excuse to make it worse exactly willful ignorance of the subject you're covering old

994
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:07,231
You do know some things and you're just pretending not to know that because

995
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,559
Will be inconvenient for the inertia

996
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,911
Yeah it's fine to give it up to Alex that on paper a lot of his

997
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,215
Positions about things like the NSA are good

998
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,055
Principal belief is a little bit much

999
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
Taking Alex seriously on this issue is honestly kind of funny because he's the last person I would accuse of being a serious Epona

1000
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
Authoritarian leadership

1001
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
For one thing he made

1002
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
Cartoonish accusations about how like

1003
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:40,255
Obama was going to become a tyrant like he was going to dissolve the government so he could turn the country into part of the oneworld caliphate that

1004
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Ruled the caliphate

1005
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:46,911
Engaging with the notion of tyranny like this indicates a lack of seriousness about the

1006
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
I'm not somebody who you should

1007
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Good job

1008
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
Their thoughts on

1009
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Cuz they're not going to

1010
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,335
Or you can look at how he behaved with Trump

1011
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,687
He was cheering on Trump's authoritarian leanings at every turn and yelling

1012
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
Further

1013
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:06,623
He wanted Trump to imprison his political enemies take over the media militarize the border and Outlaw the Democrat

1014
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Credit party

1015
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,231
If this is someone you're taking it all seriously on the subject of authoritarianism

1016
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
The Joke is on You

1017
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
Also Alex is politics are really simple

1018
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:21,215
You look John Birch Society styled anti-communist reactionary who wants to install a white

1019
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
Christian heterosexual dominate

1020
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
State

1021
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:31,455
I mean it's just it but he's not going to tell you that

1022
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
Just don't know Glen

1023
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
Gunn you don't have a place in Alex

1024
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
As well just in case you were wondering

1025
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,111
Good luck buddy good luck

1026
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
You want a van over the guy who wants

1027
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
Weird

1028
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Oh my God

1029
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Hey do know he's only going

1030
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
After trans people right now

1031
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
I'm sure whenever he's done with that

1032
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
He's going to stop

1033
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
That's how it works right

1034
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,823
What you go after lgbtq you stop after one of the letters you don't go after all of

1035
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
That makes sense

1036
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,943
Glenn Glenn Miller in a hard lesson the Dave Rubin

1037
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
Is learning

1038
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Concurrently

1039
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
At some point

1040
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,855
Enjoy there's no Freight in that no

1041
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Yeah

1042
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
Alex response to this question that you very rightly pointed out Glenn was basically answering in the delivery of

1043
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
And because I think

1044
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
Maybe partially because of that Alex

1045
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
I don't know the f***

1046
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
Even this answer is

1047
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,823
How have you seen yourself

1048
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Ideological

1049
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Kaliyan NE

1050
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Politically linear

1051
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,943
Exactly exactly

1052
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
Starting out

1053
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
I got a 596

1054
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
First

1055
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,063
Communist Alex Jones

1056
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
I was against the Warriors and surveillance

1057
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
Legacy Mike what Bill of Rights

1058
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Real quick

1059
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,583
94-95 Alex Jones is a communist

1060
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
No way

1061
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
How old was

1062
00:44:53,887 --> 00:45:00,031
Well first of all beginning his career.

1063
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
The time

1064
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:05,663
He was attacking from the right he's trying to pretend that he was called the Communist cuz he opposed bush

1065
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
It sucks.

1066
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
Acupuncturist misology to have that in

1067
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Background

1068
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
How to be a right-wing ship bags

1069
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
From the Star for sure

1070
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
So this is bad

1071
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
And I will just follow Constitution

1072
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
I was simply

1073
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
Thinking won't promote Freedom that's that's a fun thing to do

1074
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,191
Actually work came from and then

1075
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,471
And then

1076
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
Machine

1077
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,567
18 years ago or so

1078
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
Should I want to fly you out here to California

1079
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Tu2ru

1080
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
The song

1081
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
We really love what you're doing so I get their house

1082
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
So you're really a good liberal

1083
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,719
Curious George George Bush

1084
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,047
And they didn't care that I was pro-gun or either stuff is like

1085
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
Let's have dinner right now

1086
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,215
We're talkin like 18 years ago

1087
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
Roast beef

1088
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,567
Gene's house in Malibu

1089
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
What's this place

1090
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,687
I had no idea I private jet Landslide by the California

1091
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,295
Exposing

1092
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,135
I don't want to support

1093
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,559
This is astonishing

1094
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Continuing

1095
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
The same stuff so

1096
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
To me I literally just

1097
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Access

1098
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
TV like 21 years old

1099
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
22

1100
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
Russia located 23

1101
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
Totally self-taught

1102
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Thomas tags

1103
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,991
But Jennifer appoints the truth Hollywood

1104
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,319
What it does and the right amount

1105
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,623
I know this great experience

1106
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
Over 28 years on air

1107
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Of like

1108
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,999
Underbelly

1109
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Of all the stuff because I didn't come

1110
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
Intuit

1111
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
I literally came out of Access TV and also

1112
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
The Texas

1113
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,775
I got to see somebody else something

1114
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,847
Show me some more questions

1115
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,479
Question but whatever

1116
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,807
There's no reason to ask a follow-up to the original question because

1117
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,367
Brendan really care that much to begin with

1118
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
Is really just a launch

1119
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Too bad for Alex

1120
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
Let's go off on some rambling diatribe that

1121
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,767
Eventually going to include him saying that he doesn't

1122
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,791
Lie on purpose

1123
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
At some point

1124
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
It's very defensive

1125
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
About that seem like that almost like he's about

1126
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
To go on trial

1127
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,263
What's this song trial here

1128
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
Super defense

1129
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:47,199
You don't really interesting no like except these stories with his left-wing folks like Martin Sheen mistake

1130
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,759
Only thinking that he's on the list because he hated Bush but

1131
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
You never really hear any stories about right-wingers

1132
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,903
Who invited Alexander only to realize that he hasn't right-wing after all

1133
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:01,279
You had like that Colter was on his show and she laughed at him for being so far right

1134
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,815
He sounded like Lyndon larouche

1135
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,887
But I don't think anyone on the right we'll talk to Alex

1136
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,983
Suitable weight disappointed thing that always not on our side

1137
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
Nobody

1138
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Doubt

1139
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,407
Glenn has another question

1140
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
For Alex

1141
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
That is really just

1142
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Siteman

1143
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,319
Show me some more questions

1144
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,671
You know what is so striking when I begin running about politics

1145
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Open 2005

1146
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Let me ask you this

1147
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,303
How does Anthony Hopkins like his roast beef

1148
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
Liberals hated

1149
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
More than anybody George Bush

1150
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
The Architects of the Iraq War

1151
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
I begin writing an APA

1152
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
Rendition the

1153
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
The torturers

1154
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
Guantanamo and due process

1155
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
Is Freddy imprisonment

1156
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
It's just so striking

1157
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,711
Implementing adware ad

1158
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Eating it Ark

1159
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
Legally acceptable in fact

1160
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
The love

1161
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
Mainstream level circles liberals watch media Outlets

1162
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Zoom media Outlets

1163
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
Polos people

1164
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
As I was saying I could

1165
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
Interview all of them and I would

1166
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,535
You

1167
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
Go back in 2004 work

1168
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
Saying

1169
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
Don't trust George W bush

1170
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,935
His father was a CIA director the

1171
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
The Iraq war is based on lies all things

1172
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Y'all

1173
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,823
To that sensibility liberals you are

1174
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Uniquely cast

1175
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Hostile

1176
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Good,

1177
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
The point where you're one of the very people

1178
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,991
People that even journalists are called

1179
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Why is that why I have

1180
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
You

1181
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Been identified

1182
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
The rat in a way that others

1183
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
People who actually have

1184
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
Warriors on their legs

1185
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Aren't even

1186
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
Even remotely

1187
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
Answer my question and I

1188
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Only learned

1189
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
Just went through

1190
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
Experience of it but

1191
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
I think I think going to take a piss

1192
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,799
Concerned with himself and his good buddy Tucker

1193
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Who is a huge supporter of the war back in

1194
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,127
Bowtie days

1195
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,759
This is an interesting point although one that Alex has nothing interesting to stay to say on the subject

1196
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:03,647
There has been some attempt to rehabilitate the images of people like George W bush and that's been a distasteful

1197
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,183
Deceive

1198
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,023
That said I don't think it's been as successful as Glenn is pretending and

1199
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,583
I don't know how many falling pieces were seeing about

1200
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
Dick Cheney or Karl Rove the

1201
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
These days

1202
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:19,775
Who is larger point though all the mainstream media Outlets have drunk people on their rosters of talking

1203
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Crackheads

1204
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,847
Hi kellyanne Conway was just on CBS

1205
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,175
Today and she was a person to draw

1206
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,223
Hire to lie to the media for him

1207
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,319
It does suck but media Outlets do feature some shity people but

1208
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,111
Their people fall within a certain

1209
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
Spectrum of shittiness

1210
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,535
And most right-thinking people understand that Alex is outside that range

1211
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
Works have a worm farm somewhere

1212
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
I suspect that a giant part of Alex's

1213
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,191
No not being allowed in

1214
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:53,311
Is there a I think it's less about what Alex believes or would say and more about how he would act

1215
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
He's already shown himself

1216
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,711
Through countless appearances to be unable to stop himself or just yelling and self-promoting

1217
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,247
Instead of actually doing an interview

1218
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
Do you like with Piers Morgan

1219
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,575
Can Andrew Neil in the UK

1220
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
Or the time that he was on The View

1221
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
If I were TV Booker I'd be pretty where that Alex isn't going to be a guest that participates in any discussion you might be trying to have

1222
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,119
I'm just going to steamroll everything and Gail infowars.com

1223
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
He's a shity guess

1224
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:21,471
Stays further evidenced by his appearances on the podcast like

1225
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
Flagrant 2 and Rogan

1226
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:28,895
He just gets wasted yells nonsense at the only reason you'd want him around as if you're looking for a spectacle

1227
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Boat TV shows wouldn't

1228
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
Consider the spectacle to be worth the hassle of having Alex on

1229
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,831
But the math is different for desperate people and charlatan

1230
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,623
So here we are

1231
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,903
Yep that explains

1232
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
The situation

1233
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,535
Glen's questions so far are living

1234
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
More than up to my standard in fact I did not expect that he would be asking Alex uncle

1235
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
Long the lines of

1236
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,335
Alex your shoes are so great we are knighting you a paladin of Truth tomorrow

1237
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
Tell me more about how you came by them

1238
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,759
This question particular I think I would translate as like why won't you come on their show

1239
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Is it because you're

1240
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
Do right about things

1241
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
Also

1242
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,135
Isn't it really awesome that I'm not

1243
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,695
Scared to interview you like all those other media Outlets

1244
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
I'm pretty awesome

1245
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
It's nice that we do

1246
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,631
It's nice to two of us two of the biggest dick people in the world

1247
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,983
Get to share a stage together for one moment you know it's just rare to see this happen

1248
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,567
So here's Alex's answer to whatever question that was

1249
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
True organic

1250
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Experience of advice

1251
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
If I lied about wmds

1252
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,319
If I kill millions of people

1253
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Establishment

1254
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,159
But they're they're not scared of Alex Jones

1255
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
They're scared of populist movement

1256
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,511
And the fact that I wasn't left-wing or right-wing

1257
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
The fact that I was just

1258
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,327
Pro-america

1259
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Freedom

1260
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,959
They just saw me

1261
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
Okay

1262
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
Did this is what the American people produce

1263
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
This is working

1264
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,663
Who I was

1265
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
Rockledge Gardens

1266
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
And so this is this is the enemy

1267
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,087
And so it's their hatred of the General Public

1268
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
Their hatred of the organic

1269
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
Grassroots

1270
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
It's not me

1271
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,207
It's their hatred

1272
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
Good disa class

1273
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,047
Circle liberal America

1274
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,863
They want peace and Winchester they want you to

1275
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
And Winchester

1276
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:31,007
We don't hurt anybody without judging by which one our freedom

1277
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
EXO

1278
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,567
That's what freaked them out

1279
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
This guy

1280
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Get this popular

1281
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
Idiocracy

1282
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
TV One

1283
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,735
I'm a symbol of their insecurities

1284
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
What's wrong

1285
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
They're weak

1286
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
And that push Arrow

1287
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:54,303
You know it isn't it isn't it is interesting that the thing they hate most are people who develop influence

1288
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,583
Any significant audience

1289
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
Without being caught

1290
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,911
To their structures and their influence

1291
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Wow

1292
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,751
Listen

1293
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:09,151
Look at what's happening now I'm developing an influence independent of all this b******* how about that

1294
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,687
The Glenn's not other that either

1295
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Weird

1296
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,271
Huh

1297
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,135
Also I mean it's all good and well to talk about Alex not being butthold in

1298
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
To see at a door

1299
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:27,583
News core somebody

1300
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,399
Most of his career

1301
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
Hawking gold for a weirdo to constantly doing the Earth is going to fall

1302
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
Pull-A-Part so you better buy gold ads

1303
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,199
You're weirdly in the documentary and this interview Ted Anderson doesn't come up once

1304
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,575
Oh that's so crazy strange

1305
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
We're mad

1306
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:56,255
I didn't hear matter I was matter when I was driving by your brother yet

1307
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:01,631
Where is pushed into the document now you're free I'm still reliving it for the first time

1308
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
Are living it for the first time

1309
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,751
So here isn't the next question and I actually think

1310
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,031
That this is going to be

1311
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
Question

1312
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,847
It doesn't

1313
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,431
It doesn't go anywhere and I might be misinterpreting it

1314
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
It is interesting that the

1315
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:20,575
I hate most people who develop influence and a significant audience without being capped

1316
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
Give to their structures and their influence

1317
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
And that is something

1318
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
That defines what

1319
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Are you done

1320
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
More than anything

1321
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
Stevie which was tolerated

1322
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Because it supposed

1323
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,815
Will be a joke that no one watches

1324
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
And yet you developed

1325
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Just like an accordion

1326
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
And clearly part of why is

1327
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,447
Because you haven't kind of

1328
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,007
Shellman Charisma kind of

1329
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Entertainment

1330
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
People want to watch

1331
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,639
And one of the things that struck me was you know you were talk

1332
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
Buckner Leon and

1333
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,943
Itsfunneh

1334
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
Episode about how when you were 12 you would

1335
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,087
These preachers with Rolls-Royce is doing coke off hooker

1336
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,879
Braxton and whatever

1337
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:59,999
And that you would have those kind of Showmanship they were able to get people to watch

1338
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,791
And by the end of the film or watching you

1339
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
You talking about

1340
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
Praying for

1341
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,167
Bush and satanic influences in a way that

1342
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,239
I'm just wondering

1343
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:16,639
Kind of similar

1344
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,711
But for a good cause it wasn't on purpose

1345
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,527
Only a 48 can I now see it

1346
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,623
No I was like damn that's a hot slept that preachers bang on his back porch

1347
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,695
Rob Lowe's roast

1348
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,535
I mean I wasn't doing that consciously but yeah there's

1349
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,071
Christopher

1350
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,423
Nnn is so only out like 48

1351
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
What year is it

1352
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,495
Well what have I been doing I kind of like

1353
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,799
You look like

1354
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
Do you like

1355
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
Damn I did all that

1356
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
I got

1357
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,223
I Didn't Do It consciously

1358
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,039
This is lying according to formulas

1359
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,575
I did never do stuff on purpose

1360
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,927
So this could actually be interpreted as a priest scathing question which

1361
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,535
Maybe why Alex Dodge the real meaning behind if I turn it on that Charisma and talking about titties

1362
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:11,679
The point of the preachers thing is that Alex has a kid it wasn't that they were preachers at

1363
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,007
Beaver Pious as an act

1364
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:19,103
To make money and then they realize they did Coke off sex workers on book

1365
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,175
If taken as it appears to be asked

1366
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,015
Glen's question would seem to be asking about a possible Dynamic where Alex is

1367
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
Become the same kind of hypocrite

1368
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,623
Frantic with the devil on-air to make bunnybutt living

1369
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
Discord

1370
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
Good life

1371
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,231
I'm not sure if that's what Glenn was getting at but

1372
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,047
That's the most generous interpretation I can come up with so

1373
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,375
I'm going to imagine his point as good as pause

1374
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
In response Alex

1375
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,959
What's on this little show

1376
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,775
A TENS with to wrestle with the idea that he's a preacher

1377
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,823
And that he's done bad stuff in the past

1378
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
Master whatever great

1379
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,663
It's not that he's a preacher on Aaron a millionaire author

1380
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
If nothing else

1381
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,735
Alex does have good in

1382
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
On when to distract

1383
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
Text from dangerous

1384
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,927
Also he brought back up that whole I don't lie on purpose think again which is really starting

1385
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,999
Become more suspicious the Glen is not calling it out

1386
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
I mean

1387
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,839
The number of times that he is essentially saying

1388
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,143
Because I didn't do bad on

1389
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Purpose

1390
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,471
Do not hold me accountable for doing bad

1391
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,031
As though the only crime in the world is

1392
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
First

1393
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
Degree murder

1394
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
All other crimes are legal

1395
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,175
As long as it's not premeditated murder

1396
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
You're golden baby

1397
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,015
Just apologize singer sorry

1398
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,063
And then cash another check

1399
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
Like

1400
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,743
It's like the reverse of the John Stuart Mill the only thing that is good is that is truly

1401
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,279
Good is a Goodwill

1402
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:45,119
And the whale

1403
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,447
Alright buddy

1404
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
Agree with you until

1405
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,287
You Flame

1406
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
Anyway

1407
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,383
So this next clip they're talkin about January 6th

1408
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,687
And Alex has some stuff that I think

1409
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
Really f******

1410
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
Stupid

1411
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:06,879
If Alex is career and what he does on Eric you be able to recognize the

1412
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
He was being lied

1413
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
At all if I had it all

1414
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Did you again

1415
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
I was just step back

1416
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,583
Make the ship

1417
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,143
Cuz I'm not a revolutionary leader

1418
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,167
Like War

1419
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,471
I'm not trying to lead rope don't have some weird

1420
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,519
Taking my military

1421
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,055
G.i. Joe guy

1422
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,359
But when you get a million people in DC

1423
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
It doesn't matter

1424
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,431
Even if they're being manipulated

1425
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,479
You still your responsibility

1426
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,759
Bi-Mart guilt over

1427
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
January 6th

1428
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
Because he could have gone

1429
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Really bad

1430
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,647
Is a federal provocateurs a way they would have

1431
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
The cube

1432
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
People would've actually

1433
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
Kidnap

1434
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,767
Mike Pence and Pelosi and put them in

1435
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Handcuffs

1436
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,583
Martial law

1437
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,375
Cuz that would have been us

1438
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,911
That would have been

1439
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,703
The country going so we came

1440
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,775
January 2nd closing

1441
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
It was meant

1442
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,359
Provocateur us into a violin

1443
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Control thank God it

1444
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
Failed

1445
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,223
And so

1446
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
The edge of death

1447
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
And so

1448
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
January 6th

1449
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Let me ask you about the

1450
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
Underlying

1451
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
Pazzo

1452
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
January

1453
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,927
Such b*******

1454
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,975
Like it was taken as gospel fact

1455
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:21,375
Act on Infowars that if Biden got into office the literal Christian devil would take his place as the head of the country alive

1456
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
With comedy

1457
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
China

1458
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
Hey would be all over

1459
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Before the Patriot

1460
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
As soon as I'd got into office

1461
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,359
Looks like Alex will be rounded up and sent to camps as

1462
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,407
The orderly depopulation

1463
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
The planet

1464
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Took off

1465
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,503
Now in hindsight since I didn't happen

1466
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
It's so fun

1467
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
For Alex to say

1468
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
If I could do it all over I

1469
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,135
Just let Biden get into office and fail

1470
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
Because

1471
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,927
You know to take response

1472
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,999
Possibility for the rhetoric he was using before the election

1473
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,047
Would just be embarrassing now

1474
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
And Glenn doesn't know where doesn't care about what Alex has on his show right he saw this dumb documentaries

1475
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,495
He's going to let this b******* stand-on question

1476
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,055
I would call that do Mark oven on

1477
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,591
Unprepared interviewer

1478
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
This is not good

1479
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,175
We can have something like this

1480
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
There is a very clear

1481
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,247
Next follow-up

1482
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
That is

1483
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,063
Okay if you you're saying

1484
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,879
But if you could do this all over again

1485
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
You would just lie by

1486
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Didn't get into office

1487
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,999
And that we do no see whatever we're seeing now

1488
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:27,423
Are you lying to me now or were you lying to your audience about the devil ascending to the throne and aligning with diamond

1489
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Is China

1490
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,751
And everything being over the day Biden

1491
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
Comes Adolphus

1492
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
Were you lying to your audience or lying to me

1493
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
I am lying

1494
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
To boast

1495
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:41,247
Right at the end of Alex's

1496
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,831
The idea that there was an underlying

1497
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Cause

1498
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
Of January say

1499
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
Fix the metal courses

1500
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,439
The election fraud

1501
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,511
Storyline Glenn doesn't follow up with like

1502
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Okay

1503
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,815
So you think it was

1504
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,607
If it would gone wrong

1505
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,191
You know you think it gone wrong and if it had gone right it would have been bad

1506
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,239
Why do you think it would have been bad if it

1507
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Chittagong right

1508
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,383
Wouldn't you be the f****** White House Press correspondents

1509
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,783
Employee who is hosting your show for you say the capital is falling in the Patriots or now

1510
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:21,183
He thinks that the Patriots being in charge certainly one of your employees was celebrating it as it was happening

1511
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
Crazy

1512
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
Weird anyways

1513
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:26,047
Election fraud stuff

1514
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,119
In this case where you were saying there was widespread fraud

1515
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Did you

1516
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,263
Meticulous a forensic analysis of devoting patterns

1517
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Include

1518
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
Daenerys prodan

1519
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
Estates of fish

1520
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,383
The election or was this kind of an

1521
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
Looks like a way of saying

1522
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,991
So against Trump from the big

1523
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
Illegitimate ways

1524
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
That I'm going to kind

1525
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
Endorse this cause

1526
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
Not because

1527
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
Necessarily

1528
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
True and it's

1529
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,671
Particulars

1530
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
But more as kind of

1531
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,487
Automatic way of protesting

1532
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,023
Alarm and I'll be honest with you

1533
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,631
It was no it was a pre-baked

1534
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399
Deal

1535
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
That

1536
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
Obviously

1537
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
What's

1538
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
Trump

1539
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,031
These beliefs all the weird

1540
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Yo

1541
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,079
Anomalies in my

1542
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
Democrats

1543
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
The windows in

1544
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,943
People like feeding machines full of things and

1545
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
We saw some evidence

1546
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,759
But we were expecting him

1547
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,063
Until you can say

1548
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
Conclusion

1549
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,391
And we all looked Aerostar Darkly

1550
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
50/50

1551
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,719
A2000 bules Altos

1552
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Come out

1553
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,303
Omarosa Trump

1554
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,351
But what equates better that's fine

1555
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
We now get to see what these Dallas

1556
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
It's really about

1557
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Willie spectralux

1558
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,079
When your Hammer everything is a nail

1559
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
I mean I think

1560
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,639
We destroyed our videos

1561
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
Jones admits

1562
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,503
He distorted views

1563
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,551
It got covered up not surprised but

1564
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
I'm not going to lie and say

1565
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,367
We didn't

1566
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,671
I didn't distort My Views in hindsight

1567
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
21

1568
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
Yeah you know I think

1569
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
One of those

1570
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,303
The things I think about alot

1571
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
A solid media it's

1572
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
To spread this

1573
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,167
Information they like

1574
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,471
Play in ways far worse than what

1575
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
What you do

1576
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:14,079
Kind of

1577
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Wow

1578
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,711
So once again really driving home the point that Alex insists he doesn't lie on purpose which

1579
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
Kind of ship make

1580
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,503
Anyone listening

1581
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:27,135
Suspicious that he feels guilty about how much he lies on purpose I mean it is a f****** lot

1582
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,695
Man yeah a lot too much

1583
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Yeah

1584
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,047
Also listening to this should really be picking up on what Alex

1585
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
The same

1586
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,399
Essentially saying that his entire coverage of the question of Alexa

1587
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,471
I'm proud of the 2020 election was a predetermined narrative

1588
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
He decided

1589
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Need a report on

1590
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
For the election

1591
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
Anything ever

1592
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
Alex

1593
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,151
There was evidence

1594
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
The broad butt

1595
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:55,807
Any half-decent interviewer might want to point out that this evidence that Alex is bringing up like a 2000 mules thing

1596
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
A bull s***

1597
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
Alex is describing

1598
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,159
Is confirmation bias

1599
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:04,255
He'd made up his mind and then anything he saw could be used

1600
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Justified

1601
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,071
The conclusion he already had in mind

1602
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
He was already going to look at 8

1603
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,959
Affirm that was automatically considered bombshell proof of election fraud

1604
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,495
Because he desperately needed

1605
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,775
Get to justify the narrative

1606
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,079
He was going to sell his audience no matter what

1607
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,967
This seems to fly directly in the face of the hundred times Alex says that he doesn't lie on purpose and

1608
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,991
The only way to release

1609
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,295
Square the circle is the suggested

1610
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,623
Maybe Alex doesn't even really know the difference between lying and telling the truth

1611
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,391
Yeah I mean

1612
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,695
If you're saying that I've never lied on purpose

1613
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,975
You don't understand what a liar

1614
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
Elias purpose

1615
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
You can't

1616
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
Fly

1617
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Not on purpose

1618
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
That is true you can be wrong

1619
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,423
You can't lie unless you know the

1620
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,959
The answer that you are up

1621
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,495
Mariah

1622
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,031
That's not how it works

1623
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,359
The other thing that incompetent interviewer could

1624
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,199
Keys out of this if they understood what Alex was saying and knew anything about his

1625
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,991
Career is that you could take

1626
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,783
This glaring

1627
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,647
Shocking admission on Alex's bar that they that they were going to

1628
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,999
Did you say election fraud no matter what there wasn't any evidence was Apria gone conclusion

1629
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
I feel like me screaming what

1630
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559
Every second

1631
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,863
It made perfect sense an attitude in Glennie

1632
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,655
Any reasonable interviewer would be like

1633
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,751
And then what you could do from there

1634
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
Is

1635
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
Bring up

1636
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
How that's all he

1637
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:27,199
When you have the situation with his coverage of the Uvalde shooting

1638
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,991
He was doing

1639
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
That

1640
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,831
He had a foregone conclusion that he wanted to bring up

1641
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,367
Enter pieces of evidence

1642
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,671
That we're bulshit unchecked

1643
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:41,535
On any way we're treated as gospel

1644
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
They

1645
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,119
Upheld The Narrative he wanted to tell right

1646
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,911
Same thing with the Boston bombing

1647
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,447
Same thing with Sandy Hook

1648
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Same thing

1649
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,031
With every single thing in his career

1650
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,591
He comes up with a conclusion

1651
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
Mme evidence

1652
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Is

1653
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,175
Stuffy's figured out out of

1654
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,455
Confirmation bias

1655
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
To justify the conclusion

1656
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,271
He was always going to

1657
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,319
Yep and Glenn doesn't even take a

1658
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,599
Step towards that

1659
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,695
It's right there in front of like a choice

1660
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,327
It is crazy because

1661
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
Because

1662
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,191
Glenn is trying to do a softball interview

1663
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,751
And Alex is trying to

1664
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,591
Force him to do a Hardball interview by being so

1665
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:29,407
Admitting to a crime

1666
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,967
What is doing the softball interview now examples like

1667
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:38,367
Dewsoft

1668
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,183
Let's mix it up a little bit

1669
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,023
What are we going to lose the audience please

1670
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,839
Is in some way challenge something

1671
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,143
Aw man

1672
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,703
Even for Alex

1673
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,031
That's bad

1674
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:01,151
To ask if I intentionally lied about stuff in order to overthrow the government

1675
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:07,551
Do you want to take a swing at this Glen did you realize that Joe Rogan's are better journalist than you now don't take a bite

1676
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,087
Light off that apple or

1677
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:15,487
Do you want to just talk about how bad the other media is now I'm not as bad as them and bring

1678
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
Great cricket

1679
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,095
Jesus this world is sad

1680
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:24,447
Send a text later

1681
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:29,055
Dropped dramatically so that is now $4000000 a Bitcoin my friend

1682
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,615
Where's guns next question

1683
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,943
When you are somebody who standing against kind of establish

1684
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,223
Authority and established

1685
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,015
Institutions you know that one of the things

1686
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
Any mistake

1687
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
You make

1688
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
So

1689
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:48,511
Is is is in this is what I kind of try and counsel people all the time you're trying to be dissidents which is you need to be a thousand times

1690
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
More careful

1691
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,631
Because they can lie all the time and no one's going to call them out on it because they're on the side of

1692
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
The people with the more powerful megaphone

1693
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:01,055
Do you feel insufficient

1694
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,079
Attention

1695
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,151
Today need not to hand your enemies really

1696
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,735
Easy and cheap weapons for them to take in back your over the head with

1697
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,759
100%

1698
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
Wow

1699
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,319
1

1700
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:16,927
An amazing spin cycling is giving out

1701
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:22,047
Almost like something like you said that ball on a tee to make it easier for Alex dead

1702
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,607
Alex just grieving parents

1703
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:29,727
He intentionally lied about election fraud in a way that led to an attempted overthrow of our government

1704
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,775
He's undoubtedly killed Bass

1705
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,335
Numbers of his fans through his vaccine b*******

1706
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,615
These artists

1707
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
Sentence of Alex

1708
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,199
Just stop being careful enough and giving his opponent

1709
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Easy win

1710
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,551
When's that they only need because he's anti-establishment

1711
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Asteroid

1712
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:50,463
The framing of these questions is pathetic do you realize that you said

1713
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,255
Alex defamed

1714
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,023
Grieving

1715
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
Families

1716
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,607
Yeah you did not say Alex allegedly defame

1717
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
Because Alex is

1718
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,167
Guilty of

1719
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,447
Defaming them

1720
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,471
Legally

1721
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:05,055
You don't even get to say he's kind of defamed them

1722
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,383
For he little defame them or he made a mistake

1723
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Can cry

1724
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
And after that

1725
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,759
Yeah here is Glenn's question

1726
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,783
About Sandy Hook

1727
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,575
Let's hear how great men

1728
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,599
Insightfulness

1729
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,367
Questions

1730
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,927
F****** be like that for this cuz

1731
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,999
So before I want to ask

1732
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
Aaron Basha

1733
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,911
For the head about

1734
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
Chat with the

1735
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,727
Sorry wood board me if I tried

1736
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,007
You talk about it again

1737
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Sibley

1738
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
Opposed about it

1739
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
You talk for hours about it

1740
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
Through hoops in order to act like a

1741
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
He's people angry

1742
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:45,759
I'm here

1743
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
I do not want to ask you about it

1744
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,599
I'm actually interested in myself if there is

1745
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,391
You you

1746
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,671
Have just

1747
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
You just said that

1748
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,231
That you have made

1749
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
Mistakes obvious

1750
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Play one of those is

1751
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:00,607
Is this episode about Sandy Hook we watch you in the film come very clean about the fact that

1752
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
You made statements

1753
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,911
It turned out to be untrue

1754
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,447
You've obviously spent a lot of

1755
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,983
What kind of reflective time is

1756
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
Alex Jones

1757
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,055
I seen the last part of that

1758
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
The film

1759
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,383
What is it that you think

1760
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,175
Pause you to do that

1761
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:19,551
You reference something that you don't just identify with it myself that when

1762
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,599
Do you know people who lie for a living

1763
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,903
Are telling you that you're a liar when pee

1764
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,927
People who are are

1765
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
He's job it is to spread

1766
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
Information

1767
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,255
You doing that you kind of want

1768
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,791
Dig in a little bit and

1769
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,071
And not giving in to pee

1770
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,095
People who

1771
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,631
You know I'm criticizing you in

1772
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,423
Good babe what is it about

1773
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Head of household

1774
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,983
Mediaworks about how

1775
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
Groups function

1776
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
Thought about

1777
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:45,151
Some of the psychological and cultural dynamics that that led you to

1778
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
To make some of those mistakes

1779
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,271
Wilshire think of this like a thousand page book

1780
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,111
So Glam is essentially starting this question off by apologizing

1781
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
For asking

1782
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,951
Saying that everyone expects him to that

1783
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:04,607
It's almost like a meta conversation that Glenn is having with himself about how aggrieved he is about how people View

1784
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,935
For agreeing to do this documentary kubaneh

1785
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,215
It's legitimately insane

1786
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
Yeah this is

1787
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
Nutbag o'ree of the

1788
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,103
First off Glen

1789
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:20,479
Says that if people want to know the particulars they can watch Alex talk about Sandy Hook they can watch the deposition

1790
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,599
That's all good and well but I'm fairly certain that Glenn hasn't done any of that himself

1791
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:29,183
The reality of what Alex did about Sandy Hook

1792
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:33,279
He just assumes based on what the shallowest documentary is presented

1793
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:39,679
Something's wrong I apologize for using these errors against because he's a dissident

1794
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,239
Voice that needed to be destroyed because he

1795
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
Supported Trump

1796
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,311
That's the foundation of this bad

1797
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,847
And to make the quest

1798
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
I'm building

1799
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,199
Into the question as he's asking it

1800
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:56,831
Music to Media was so unfairly mean to you that you had to defame grieving parents

1801
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,927
Sense that you'd say the people's dead kids were real because

1802
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
The media so bad

1803
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,535
Get too caught up in your Noble fight against them right

1804
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,583
I mean

1805
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
This is

1806
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,143
This is

1807
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
F***** up

1808
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,191
Bing

1809
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
Very

1810
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
Struggling

1811
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,287
I'm struggling with this one

1812
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,127
You abused I started I started making all kinds of weird movements

1813
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,455
Hey that breathing exercises

1814
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,247
Periodically

1815
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:31,903
Your extreme Fury sweat is going

1816
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,183
Crazy right now

1817
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,463
This is not good

1818
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,279
So here's Alex's answer

1819
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,583
To that question

1820
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,887
It goes about as you

1821
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,935
Six-pack Sandy Hook family

1822
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Alex

1823
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:48,799
Please continue to cause problems for them in front of me right now

1824
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,359
Has an interesting take on it

1825
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,943
That I think won't surprise anybody who listen star showed

1826
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Wilshire

1827
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,271
Think of this like a thousand page book

1828
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
Is Sandy Hook

1829
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,343
8:15

1830
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:10,047
The diner that sounds just like overweight

1831
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Phone calls

1832
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,031
Struggle

1833
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567
They got to take

1834
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
Pieces of that out of context

1835
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
Describe

1836
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Fast forward

1837
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,479
I do a Sunday show

1838
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063
Mabel's mother

1839
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
Forget but

1840
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:33,855
They say

1841
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,391
He's at 2:30 in the morning

1842
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:39,487
Jump leash on him and put a new sovers head

1843
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,815
I said I don't care if I get sued

1844
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,095
This doesn't sound real

1845
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,887
Edwards it wasn't real

1846
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,423
Or or or or

1847
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,471
Live at NASCAR race

1848
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,519
Driver Bubba whatever is Bubba Wallace

1849
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,079
They have to do some hanging in my things like

1850
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,615
What you just know that's BS

1851
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:01,503
Journalistic and I have the witnesses and I have the proof and

1852
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
You know

1853
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,319
Jussie Smollett full of crap

1854
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,599
But I still

1855
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,367
When on air

1856
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
But I said

1857
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,463
The dad rabbit I said Jesse's mouth full of crap

1858
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,023
There's not do 223 below zero

1859
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,559
Running around it

1860
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,583
2:30 in the morning

1861
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
Dumping bleach on black people get you

1862
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,519
Attack black people

1863
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:27,359
I mean like going on

1864
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,663
Social

1865
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:32,991
The internet doesn't buy anything it's told him or cuz they've been watched

1866
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,295
Thank you so much

1867
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,087
I didn't say anything about Uvalde

1868
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,367
State Police said

1869
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,159
Everything we were told to lie

1870
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,183
We don't know what happened

1871
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,279
You want on lies and incompetence in there

1872
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,327
77 minutes can down the police

1873
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,655
Hand sanitizer so long answer

1874
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,727
Jesus riding with the quest

1875
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,823
Austin weather

1876
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,847
Really remembers

1877
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,871
Do you get sick

1878
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
2%

1879
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:07,039
Even with all this softball features that are built into this question and with Glenn doing everything he can to make out

1880
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,575
Mixing justified in heroic

1881
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:12,415
Alex can't handle answering this question correctly without getting lost

1882
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,719
Austin is talking points about everything is fake

1883
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,255
Also it might

1884
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,535
IBEW good idea

1885
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:22,399
For Glen to ask a follow-up about how it's suspicious that the only two examples

1886
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,191
Can come up with from modern history

1887
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,751
Sometimes he's called things fake and he feels confident about

1888
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,775
Still saying that

1889
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,823
He denied in alleged hate

1890
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
Crime

1891
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,615
With smaller

1892
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:35,199
Fair enough on that but he was right for the wrong reasons

1893
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:39,551
With Bubba Wallace Alex doesn't even understand the basic fact that situation

1894
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,623
Say that essentially no one in that audio

1895
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,159
Even remembers that case

1896
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:48,255
Totally pretty Grim stuff and if I were Glenn and I had already

1897
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,071
This is about the time where I would realize that I'm interviewing a

1898
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:57,471
Keeping track of what question-answering

1899
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,775
Either either Glen is like

1900
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,311
Playing

1901
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:07,967
F****** cartoon in his head while Alex talks and I mean yeah it has to be cuz there's no way

1902
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,015
Intimately listening to this human being speak

1903
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,319
If you the next word you say or the ones going

1904
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,599
Green inside

1905
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,647
The whole time

1906
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,463
It's just like

1907
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,487
Question

1908
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,767
Answer

1909
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,047
Oh wow

1910
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,631
Next question not even a Concepcion no response

1911
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,423
What's B acknowledges the answer

1912
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,007
Glenn Glenn is asking a question

1913
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:36,383
Answering the question two-way Alex should answer it and then allowing it Alex to say a bunch

1914
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,943
Stopping them pretending that Alex didn't say anything

1915
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Right

1916
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,527
This is a frustrating experience for me

1917
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,111
Pleasant Glen

1918
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,391
Refocusing the quest

1919
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Henry asking Alex

1920
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,999
Another bite at the Apple as it were

1921
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,607
Good job

1922
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
What was it

1923
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,983
What do you think

1924
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
Which of these kind of errors

1925
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
Forgiven

1926
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:09,407
It going

1927
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,991
And So you you're not putting a journalistic filter on things

1928
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:19,391
Article I would do that or make a film I was like these together those were

1929
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
But

1930
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:24,767
O'Hare Cavalier cigarettes

1931
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,143
You know do whatever man

1932
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,935
E-40 God

1933
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,471
So-so

1934
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:38,335
So your excuses you were drunk

1935
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
I told the car but I wasn't

1936
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:48,831
I was just free associating okay it's alright

1937
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,367
These kids didn't alright

1938
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:56,511
Okay so this motorcyclist is now part of that tree over there but in my defense I was drunk

1939
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:00,607
I love I love the way that Alex will be on are it'll be like

1940
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,935
20 hours a day studying this stuff

1941
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:10,335
Breathe asleep the globalist I know what their plans backwards and forwards

1942
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
But I'm not working

1943
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Why does

1944
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,439
Why don't people understand

1945
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,975
Expect the defenses

1946
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,023
Excellent and unimpeachable defense

1947
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:29,791
Is big

1948
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,839
Because we have to fill time

1949
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
It's okay

1950
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,399
Okay for us to defame

1951
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Parents

1952
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,191
And make money

1953
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:42,335
Well if you're going to make it all but sometimes you got to go take him to Michelle's

1954
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,895
Unreal

1955
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,479
So Alex complains about this trial

1956
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
I'm probably going to

1957
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,343
Probably boycott

1958
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
Something because

1959
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,951
That's not a trial where that would happen God caught again

1960
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,511
Add body to my basement

1961
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,839
I could get up and we have that bodies when we

1962
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
We have them in your basement

1963
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,911
I'm still innocent your honor

1964
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,679
Adjudge

1965
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
Never said you can't say Uranus

1966
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
That is

1967
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
Court

1968
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
Order

1969
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,055
Starting

1970
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,616
Wednesday that I cannot see I'm innocent

1971
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
Whoa

1972
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,992
This is the end of the country

1973
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
And so

1974
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,576
Whatever things I did one on purpose

1975
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
And

1976
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,440
Add 2 points back on your license

1977
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
Myself I think

1978
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,376
What you identify this with yourself

1979
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
King s*** you f******

1980
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:43,264
Cowardly remarkable to allow Alex to say these kinds of things about his

1981
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,312
Is case and like not asked

1982
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,848
Clarifying questions like

1983
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:53,248
Because that's not a relevant question of the phase that were into this case

1984
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,040
He's making it seem like

1985
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:59,136
It's a case to determine his guilt is innocent or guilty

1986
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
And it's not

1987
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,720
Bulshit

1988
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
Listen

1989
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,560
This is how you know the Glenn Greenwald

1990
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
Knows full well

1991
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,888
Okay because

1992
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,912
If you are going to

1993
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,448
To say that out loud

1994
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
To what it's supposed

1995
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,240
A journey

1996
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
Right

1997
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,824
They have to then ask

1998
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
Well

1999
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,664
If you are guilty before this happened

2000
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
Why

2001
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,992
Why are you not allowed to say your in a

2002
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,528
Tell me why

2003
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:32,928
Explain the judge's reason why truly entire Justice System

2004
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
This is the biggest news in the world

2005
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,536
Glenn Greenwald is the first person to discover

2006
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,816
Alex Jones

2007
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,352
Has had his free rights

2008
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:46,752
His first amendment rights identities and isn't taken away from him and this is a constitutional fighting knows that the

2009
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:49,824
Person he's talking to his full of s*** because he just moves on

2010
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,432
Embarrassing if that was true

2011
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
You like I mean on

2012
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,272
If Alex truly

2013
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,808
On his first try

2014
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,856
To go to trial for this crime

2015
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
Wright was

2016
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,952
Instantly disallowed from saying he's innocent

2017
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:09,536
You and I would be talking about it I think they'll be a problem we would be

2018
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,728
Yeah if I listen cooperated with a

2019
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:21,824
The discovery process and everything and it had gotten to the point where it was going to trial

2020
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,872
Actually on the marriage

2021
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,408
The original question

2022
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,200
And he was not allowed

2023
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
2

2024
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,808
Say you was going to say it would be like that big problem

2025
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
And it never would have

2026
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,624
So

2027
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
You know

2028
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,672
Plant identifier

2029
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,464
Looks like you said there at the end

2030
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,744
Santa hears ears

2031
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,024
A little more

2032
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Broke

2033
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,328
Identified

2034
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Myself I think

2035
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:45,888
Restart office

2036
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,192
Just outside of you start off as I got access

2037
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,240
TV you start growing a little bit in

2038
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,776
Run would have been an influencer

2039
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
Suddenly you you

2040
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
Become I think

2041
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
One of the most

2042
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
Influential people in the

2043
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
Country with one of the largest audience

2044
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,272
It's hard I think sometimes to remind yourself I'm not that guy on access

2045
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
Does PV nrt

2046
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,088
Anymore because it wasn't all that long ago

2047
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,160
When you weren't getting so much scrutiny and then suddenly our subject

2048
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,952
Need anybody

2049
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,488
And I think it's hard to

2050
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
How to tighten

2051
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
You know

2052
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,560
Because it's kind of

2053
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,120
Slow incremental

2054
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,656
That's exactly what I'm going to say

2055
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:25,056
Because

2056
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,200
You know I mean I'm going to be on

2057
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,760
You know just exactly

2058
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,552
So you know

2059
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
Nancy Duarte work on

2060
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,112
Internet censorship

2061
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,392
Here's my

2062
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,928
Alcoholism

2063
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
Grow the f******

2064
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:48,352
Like I do think that it's a gradual process to adjust to Rising levels of notoriety and the Azure influence

2065
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,168
Rises you have a greater responsibility with your messaging

2066
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,824
It's also the case that you're responsible for understanding that into not understand it is you neglecting your work

2067
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
Responsibility

2068
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
It isn't an acceptable excuse to say that Alex Jones in

2069
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:05,504
2013 or onward wasn't aware of his reach and his response

2070
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Possibility

2071
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,832
He wasn't some guy on public access

2072
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:11,904
You have multiple employees and reporters working under him

2073
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:16,000
You brag on air all the time but how many viewers he got on the website

2074
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,536
If you didn't understand what

2075
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,864
Responsibility he had to the audience about delivering information

2076
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,144
That was a conscious choice

2077
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
But he was making too

2078
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704
Ignore that responsibility

2079
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,264
Because it would make his job harder and less fun

2080
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,616
For example he wouldn't be able to drink that bottle of vodka and get on air make up a bunch of s*** that

2081
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,408
It's people do it again the next

2082
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
Today

2083
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,736
You would know that he was responsible to not do that

2084
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,272
What a load of s***

2085
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,600
Pure Glam lap this up and not ask any follow-up questions

2086
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
It's really disappointing but

2087
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,184
Honestly it makes total sense

2088
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,256
He needs access to Alex in order to interview Ali

2089
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,304
Alex and if he doesn't do exactly what

2090
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,376
He is doing and if he treats out of any critical Focus

2091
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,680
He knows that he's going to lose that access

2092
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,264
Conversely I think Glen probably fully understand

2093
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,288
That the most

2094
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,848
Likely result of pushing back on Alex

2095
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,616
At all

2096
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,664
All is that this interview was going to become a fight

2097
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:11,040
It's happened in pretty much all of Alex's other high-profile interviews and that's not what

2098
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:11,808
Salon W

2099
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,672
This is supposed to be a promotional event for this image rehabilitating documentary Sue

2100
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:21,280
It would be counterproductive for the end result of this Q&A to be everyone walking away thinking

2101
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Yeah maybe

2102
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,328
Can't really interview Alex

2103
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,424
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't get many invitations cuz he's an a****** and they just added

2104
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
Open fights

2105
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,776
It's essential to Glenn and Alex Lee Moyers Griff

2106
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:35,104
For Alex to be treated seriously and not like a cartoon

2107
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
Hello referred that to be able to happen

2108
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
Do you need to treat him with kid gloves

2109
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
And it's pathetic

2110
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,760
I mean and it's not even

2111
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,784
It doesn't even work

2112
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:48,416
Alex is a cartoon they're just acting like he's not it is gas-lighting of the highest order

2113
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
For YouTube

2114
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,208
Talk to what is

2115
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,304
The words coming out of his mouth to respond what Glen is saying

2116
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,608
Is Gaslight can you imagine

2117
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,704
What kind of restraint you would need to employ to not ask

2118
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,008
The follow-up question if Alex said I was

2119
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
Drunk

2120
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,360
I drank a bottle of vodka when I defamed the families

2121
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:13,760
Amazing to me that I

2122
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:19,392
I was just drunk all narrative just threw it away because of s***

2123
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,160
Drunk

2124
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,184
That's his ark

2125
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,976
That's what he's allowed to say to

2126
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,000
Flip f******

2127
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,560
Greenwald

2128
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,584
Again the movie

2129
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,376
About how great Hitler is

2130
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,448
No Curiosity on Glenwood

2131
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:35,008
Nope sorry way that's great journalist and a great writer

2132
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,800
He's not good at

2133
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,104
Booking for the barely-there trouble finding

2134
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,920
Video

2135
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,688
Pick up the airport

2136
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
I was called that

2137
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
For a while getting

2138
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,040
Venue here in Austin

2139
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,576
Did you this event that

2140
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,600
When they found out

2141
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,648
That you were involved

2142
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,208
They said you know what on second thought we're not really into

2143
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,488
Posted in your money

2144
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
And I

2145
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,816
I thought about it for a minute in the first

2146
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,352
Of course that's

2147
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,888
The case and then I realized

2148
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,936
That shouldn't be

2149
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:09,312
So comforting like normal here that should be chilling and alarming I should be what do you mean wearing

2150
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
The United States

2151
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
Why

2152
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:15,456
Is it difficult to get a venue to show a film about somebody who

2153
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,992
Has a lot and leaving Skokie

2154
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,088
Yeah and I think

2155
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,368
Kind of Oppression

2156
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,904
That has emerged

2157
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,672
That we've been trained

2158
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,440
For so long to fill

2159
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,232
Thing takes place in other places

2160
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,536
That way we have a very hard time recognizing

2161
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,608
I think that we're actually subject to that level of repression here

2162
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,888
Have you had

2163
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,656
Problems with

2164
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,680
With the film like this

2165
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,704
Spell I'm getting

2166
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,496
Distribution in another

2167
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
Why

2168
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,056
Kind of publicity for that you

2169
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,360
They didn't have it the first film have you noticed greater

2170
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
Does a bear s*** in the woods

2171
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,432
That wasn't the question

2172
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,736
24-hour clothes for boys

2173
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
But like

2174
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
Okay

2175
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
Cares

2176
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Like

2177
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,672
The basement trying to say cancel culture without saying cancel culture

2178
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,440
As if

2179
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,720
Tireless advocate

2180
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,744
Free speech

2181
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
As someone

2182
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,376
Who demands that everyone be given the choices to do what they desire

2183
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,448
When a venue refuses money

2184
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,216
Space

2185
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
Some sort of

2186
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,520
Political opinion

2187
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,800
How dare they

2188
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,592
How dare they stand up

2189
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:18,688
For that not a First Amendment right they have to deny me

2190
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,504
Giving whatever I want does he think that like

2191
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,040
If you paid for it at the theaters

2192
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:26,368
Should be forced to let you scream Song of the South or do Triumph

2193
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
From the will clearly

2194
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,184
Why

2195
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,232
Well because they didn't let him do it

2196
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,632
Cancel culture of the main pillars of Alex's idea

2197
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,912
Ecology

2198
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:44,288
Christian announces reaction to a Libertarian leanings and those

2199
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,568
Bedrock ideas

2200
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
Just lip service

2201
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:53,504
He fully supports the right of a business to not serve someone because they're black or because they're gay but you don't cry bloody murder

2202
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,064
Peter doesn't want to hear his stupid documentary

2203
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,344
Also again

2204
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,136
This question is basically just

2205
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,184
Teen Alex or Alex up

2206
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,792
To complain about how everyone's been so mean to them because they were brave enough to make this film

2207
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
And that Jordan

2208
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,632
Is good journalism tell you this right now

2209
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,912
I'm going to tell you this right now

2210
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:14,752
People have not been anywhere near mean enough to

2211
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,592
I'm doing my best and I'm not being mean I'm trying

2212
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
I'm worth

2213
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
Fighting

2214
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
So hard

2215
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:26,784
To be mean to these people I don't know what mean that's not me Miss born out of

2216
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:31,904
Bad faith or ill-will or some kind of a hostility towards them

2217
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,744
I'm just

2218
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,816
It's a reaction to the thing that they made or did

2219
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,448
Space should be treated way harsher based on how bad the

2220
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,984
The s*** they're doing is

2221
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,288
20 weight motor comes in

2222
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,848
To answer this question about finding a venue

2223
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,128
Have you had

2224
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
Problems with width

2225
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,688
The phone like this film getting

2226
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,736
Distribution in another

2227
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
Why

2228
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,040
Kind of publicity for that

2229
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,576
Didn't have it the first film have

2230
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,344
Younotus crater

2231
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,720
Sort of but also

2232
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,256
We read the tea

2233
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,280
He leaves after

2234
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,816
What happened with our last

2235
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
Feldman's

2236
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
I took matters into her

2237
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,448
How to play

2238
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,472
Hi

2239
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:21,568
We you know we started

2240
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,408
Basically talking to people outside of Hollywood

2241
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,968
I mean I don't

2242
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,248
I'm a free agent

2243
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,808
Working on this movie

2244
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
For sure and

2245
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:35,136
There are people that are interested in seeing all

2246
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,160
Content

2247
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,440
You know

2248
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
Now and 1 a.m.

2249
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:38,976
DC animated

2250
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:47,680
So play nice is the company that distributed the film and it's run by that guy who used to be in charge of cinefamily

2251
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,960
Until I got forced out because of

2252
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,496
Rampant sexual harassment

2253
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,800
Complaints against statement then the theater went out of business

2254
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:56,640
Incidentally play nice was founded partially with investment from

2255
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
Peter teal

2256
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,736
I'm sure that's a totally benign thing and not at all so

2257
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,320
Crazy Alex's next film is about how he's not

2258
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:08,160
Guilty of any of those sexual assaults that he committed do you know why

2259
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,696
He was drunk Dan

2260
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:13,536
Also I'm not sure how much stock I put into Amanda Milius voucher

2261
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,816
Looking for Moyers free

2262
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,352
Reconsider

2263
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,888
Produced and directed

2264
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:18,912
The plot against

2265
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,960
The president D Trump propaganda film

2266
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,776
The two of the producers of a Falmer producers of Alex

2267
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
And behold

2268
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,360
It was smart of millions to shorten

2269
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:32,224
The title of that movie from the title of the book that it's based on which is quote

2270
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:38,880
The plot against the president the true story of how Congressman Devin Nunez uncovered the biggest political scandal in US history

2271
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,184
Title probably wouldn't of age

2272
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,024
It's quite as well as he shortened version could have really hurt

2273
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
Could really hurt later on

2274
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,704
Twitter account

2275
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,824
The capital has fallen and that's a good thing we hadn't available

2276
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,152
What is essentially The Last Quest

2277
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:06,528
Question of of this interview

2278
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
Beginning

2279
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,576
You know where

2280
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,416
Same things that in your community in in in your politics in

01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,232
And in the media were there love that we're going to

2282
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,536
Cause you to be cast aside as a

2283
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,560
The crazy person

2284
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,888
Conspiracy theory is going back to the 90s with Waco and

2285
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,936
And end and the FBI nose hurts

2286
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,032
Why did that happen why why did you end up on this path that

2287
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,568
I called you they just

2288
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,848
Constantly be so scalp

2289
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,128
Bacolod what you're told by

2290
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:32,896
Authority

2291
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,992
You don't mind my Uncle William Parham and was

2292
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,320
Helicopter pilot Vietnam War

2293
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,088
Did Iran Contra

2294
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,624
Add

2295
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,672
He would tell me all the secrets. But he

2296
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,696
Lisa

2297
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,720
Browse like a teenager

2298
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,792
I was Alec Rush Limbaugh Legos The Run plug Ozark

2299
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,816
Control

2300
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,400
That's all I was down there visiting what two weeks ago Antonio

2301
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,960
He just eats upload you take you back on the back porch

2302
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,520
How your sandwich talk about this

2303
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,056
At least he told me about

2304
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,336
A lot of stuff

2305
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,616
In Vietnam

2306
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,408
And how he did these things he was told to do

2307
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
And then

2308
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,224
It got worse and worse and worse

2309
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,832
King of Vietnam and then it was

2310
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Everything

2311
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,648
Contra

2312
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,184
Admit metal point where

2313
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,720
They were they were smuggling

2314
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744
Blackheads out of orphanage

2315
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,024
Do you know where they were going

2316
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,560
They said that point was done

2317
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,352
So he told me about all that

2318
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,400
And then I had other family

2319
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:27,936
The other involved

2320
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,960
The Black Operations

2321
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,264
Stocking with all human intelligence MI

2322
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
Watch track

2323
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,568
I'm here in the Russian Wars

2324
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,104
So my Dad's cousin

2325
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:38,176
Was it all that much.

2326
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,712
Dinner table

2327
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
People talk about the

2328
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
The stop

2329
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,784
That's what I kind of knew what

2330
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,808
What's going on

2331
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,112
What other people did when I was growing up around then

2332
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,160
That's how I kind of heard that

2333
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
And my dad

2334
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
What's that we evolved

2335
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
Geopolitics

2336
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,512
In researching all these

2337
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,280
Coronavirus

2338
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,328
If I kind of grew up around that

2339
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,144
And these white promerica people they were saying

2340
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
Bad

2341
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,192
A lot of bad stuff

2342
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
The backroom taking over

2343
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:07,360
Yeah that they were telling me this little is a bumper sticker If you want your children to listen whisper

2344
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,640
They weren't

2345
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,944
This will be hard rock

2346
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
Corner

2347
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,992
Like Alyssa

2348
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
SSO

2349
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,320
That that's why I had a leg up on it all

2350
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,344
What's because of

2351
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,160
Well I wonder if

2352
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,696
Glenwood ask a follow-up

2353
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,464
If Alex was

2354
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:26,304
Clear about what he's talking about and it's all the John Birch Society s***

2355
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,608
Like I wonder if Glenwood

2356
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:31,424
Debates himself enough to be like

2357
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:37,568
Right maybe I get all of my greatest stickers into

2358
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
My parents didn't

2359
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
Tell me a lot about the

2360
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,432
The John Birch Society they just told me that

2361
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,712
Black people were part of

2362
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:47,040
Communist plot to take over America and that we need to fight against the Russians

2363
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:53,440
As well as civil rights with everything go well.

2364
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
Full of

2365
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
Books about the topic

2366
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,816
Bequia picture book is the only things I could read exact

2367
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,376
Also this question

2368
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,424
Klein is asking his frame.

2369
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
Lie

2370
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
Like

2371
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
He's like

2372
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,032
Pretending it what Alex did was

2373
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
Bold like

2374
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:13,152
His ship wasn't unpopular in the community he was in and the politics that he had

2375
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:16,224
In conspiracy theory anti-government militia

2376
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
Anti-communist world

2377
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,040
Everything Alex was saying was

2378
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:19,808
Popular

2379
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,856
I'm basically the standard.

2380
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,904
It was pandering BS Glen

2381
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,952
Acting like Alex at a job at

2382
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,768
CNN hosting a nightly show with any did what he did

2383
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,560
Like you took a brave stand

2384
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,144
It wasn't Brave to be a conspiracy theorist in a community of

2385
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,168
Conspiracy theories

2386
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:38,752
Maybe it would be if you were expected to not be insane

2387
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,056
But I was never the expectation for Alec

2388
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,848
He was an insane world

2389
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,408
The person they're really talking about here

2390
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
Is David Icke

2391
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,248
That guy sucks on his wrong about everything but what he

2392
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,784
He did took a lot of nerve

2393
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:57,440
He was already a big mainstream celebrity and he essentially threw that all the way to go down a crazy conspiracy path

2394
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,024
Alexander's born on that path and followed along doing the things

2395
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,816
Regarding positive reinforcement

2396
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:03,840
Intel weird

2397
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:10,240
We're here until he wound up saying the David Icke was right all along the turd in the punch bowl

2398
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,520
Who is a delicious

2399
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,544
Custard

2400
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,360
They're pretending that Alex did that

2401
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,176
Like David Icke went on TV and said that like

2402
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,712
He's Jesus

2403
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:21,760
Mad I'm

2404
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,832
I'm tired of people being allowed to Gaslight me

2405
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,856
This bad

2406
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:26,880
Pretty rough

2407
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,928
Just be like hey man I think that

2408
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,720
McDonald's nuggets are good

2409
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,280
Find your gaslighting me but that's fine

2410
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:37,632
But they're fine

2411
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,656
Exactly

2412
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:43,008
So Greenwald starts talking about like what life would be if

2413
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
You made a difference

2414
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,312
Choice Shore bike down for this

2415
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:49,920
Because I want to make sure you catch

2416
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,968
So I was right before I came

2417
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
Nothing about

2418
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,016
Where I would be

2419
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,552
Set of here if I had made

2420
01:36:56,832 --> 01:37:00,416
To pursue the kind of mainstream accountability acceptability that I was in

2421
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,976
Interested in in wondering why you had rejected

2422
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:07,584
Meaningful

2423
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,216
Accountability and acceptability that is a really good point bility is really what he's rejecting

2424
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:17,312
Like you want to pretend that you're a rebel shining acceptability that's a farce

2425
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:20,384
Just don't want to be held accountable for the things you do and Alex

2426
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,920
This is basically the Avatar that

2427
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:28,320
I have lost so much accessibility with my 1.8 million followers what I have is a

2428
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:34,208
Accountability with my ability to harass people with less of an audience than I do and receive no consequences

2429
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,000
Whoops

2430
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
Oh no

2431
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,560
Fun slip of the tongue

2432
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:43,168
Here we go this is the last clip we have this is just sort of a wrap-up

2433
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,448
And

2434
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:48,032
Still after this there's not really anything just Glenn saying goodbye to the audio

2435
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,336
So I was right before Ike

2436
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,360
Making everything about

2437
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,640
Where I would be in

2438
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,920
If here if I'd made if

2439
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
Pursue the kind of Maine

2440
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,272
Mainstream accountability acceptability that

2441
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,344
I was interested in in wondering why you had rejected

2442
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,392
And I was thinking I'd probably be in leg

2443
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:09,280
The CNN building with Wolf Blitzer and Chris Hayes and like Amy Klobuchar and Nancy Pelosi

2444
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:12,608
Wanting to kill myself out of boredom in Disguise then

2445
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:19,008
You know I referred to this crowd as I have kind of crowd of Misfits and outcasts and it is in and I'm so happy

2446
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,568
Happier to be around

2447
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,360
People like this who

2448
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,432
Play some soft on the outside and then decide the

2449
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,200
They're knocking

2450
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,736
I pay that price of kind of

2451
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,016
Embrace

2452
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:30,784
Sing things they don't

2453
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,576
Leave for whatever Awards

2454
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:37,184
They offer and you've been doing this for a decade and taking all kinds of slings and arrows and

2455
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,488
You yourself recognize you made a lot of mistakes

2456
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,560
But I'm really glad you've been doing what you're doing

2457
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,120
Well then I appreciate you coming I appreciate Alex whole thing in

2458
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:50,496
Thanks Brian

2459
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
Thanking you

2460
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,920
No number thank you

2461
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:00,224
You know I never really thanked you

2462
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,320
I didn't make mistakes on purpose

2463
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,624
Oh my god get better we all fix them

2464
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,672
A bird with a larger issue is

2465
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,976
We have a lot of

2466
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:20,192
I was going to ask you did you make mistakes on purpose or did you do them anytime soon

2467
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,008
See it's funny

2468
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:26,336
The crowd laughs and claps at Glen

2469
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:30,688
Finally acknowledging that Alex keep saying that he doesn't lie on purpose

2470
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,968
It's cathartic

2471
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,504
Get the tension breaker because the

2472
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,600
The joke is that they all know that Alex absolutely lies on purpose and has

2473
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,416
Open for the past 40 minutes or whatever you've been on stage

2474
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,720
That's the price of admission

2475
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:47,584
You want the attention and outside or credibility that you can gain from associating with Alex

2476
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:51,680
You better stick to kayfabe in percent Alex how he wants to be seen

2477
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,752
Glenn understands that which is why you didn't acknowledge the

2478
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,824
Constant insistence is that Alex doesn't lie on purpose

2479
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,896
To do so would be to call out that very notion

2480
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,664
Call it in

2481
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,688
The question where is

2482
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:03,456
It needs just

2483
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,480
To be taken as a given

2484
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,784
It's just a fundamental fact

2485
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,856
Audience laughs because they're in on the joke

2486
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:15,488
They know that Alex lies on purpose but their ability to use them as an avatar of their hatred of the main

2487
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,256
Screen press

2488
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,536
And the establishment

2489
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,352
It requires that they maintain the same kayfabe that

2490
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,376
Glen is bound by

2491
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:28,032
There's nothing challenging our brave about this content in the congratulations these idiots give themselves or engaging in it

2492
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,568
It's Hollow and meaningless

2493
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,616
What would actually be challenging

2494
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,968
In an uncomfortable position where he has to wrestle with the idea

2495
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,992
The his evasion

2496
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,808
Orca fly

2497
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,088
And see how we react

2498
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,440
There's nothing challenging about filming a liar lie and then interview in the butt

2499
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,976
Is lies as if they're true

2500
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,280
But you don't act like this

2501
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,584
Because you know Alex doesn't actually need you

2502
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,632
He wants the Press of the movie

2503
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,656
But he's fine without

2504
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,448
You need him

2505
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:01,312
And if you don't make yourself a good little soldier in Alex's imaginary War

2506
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,104
He's not going to play ball

2507
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
And you don't get it

2508
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,176
So f*** you

2509
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:06,944
You mean

2510
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,736
Here's what we were

2511
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,528
We are last episode which

2512
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,808
We recorded so long

2513
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,600
By about

2514
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,880
Stand-up comedy

2515
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:17,952
Reminds me of something important for this

2516
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:19,744
When I was coming up

2517
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,840
There was one joke that I that I told that really worked

2518
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,144
And then as I can

2519
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
Kept telling it

2520
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:30,240
I realized that I didn't know I didn't understand why it were

2521
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,032
I didn't understand what the

2522
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,056
The people were laughing

2523
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,872
I didn't know what I was really saying

2524
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,896
That made them

2525
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:40,224
Release that tension which is with the laughter where is really up

2526
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,016
And it was a f*****-up thing to say

2527
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,296
I thought I was

2528
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:46,112
Being very satirical and smart and doing all of that

2529
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,648
But the reason that they were laughing

2530
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,208
Is because they were thinking I was saying it literally

2531
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,488
That that can happen

2532
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,536
You know and then I stopped doing the joke

2533
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,584
Because if you understand why people are laughing

2534
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:00,448
Then you understand what it is you're actually saying and what it is they are understanding you to say

2535
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,984
That laugh became

2536
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Because that

2537
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,032
Akon acknowledgement

2538
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,312
Had been in the air the entire

2539
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,592
Higher f****** show

2540
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,872
And it came and

2541
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,896
It came as a laugh

2542
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,688
Because when he released the tension

2543
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,480
What the tension release was

2544
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,760
What beats flying

2545
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:14,784
Yeah

2546
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:20,672
Fine it's fine to imagine that it doesn't matter that Alex lies intentionally

2547
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,208
Cares that's what the

2548
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
The joke is

2549
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,304
We don't

2550
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:32,960
Imagine Glen ever even asking that question to begin with 100

2551
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,264
Everybody's participated in a fart

2552
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,056
Evan Glenn Greenwald gets

2553
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,592
Pop the balloon at the end

2554
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:44,992
Because it's over and everybody gets to go home on at least part of this parts of the f****** first honestly he has to pop

2555
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:51,392
Pop the balloon because the audience laughed when Alex said it the last time

2556
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:58,048
Break the tension never make the very idea of asking that question

2557
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:58,816
Itself

2558
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:03,168
It's nonsense

2559
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:03,936
F****** b*******

2560
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,472
It is pathetic

2561
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,496
And that is a

2562
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,288
Sad sad sad sad

2563
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Sadman

2564
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:13,152
I mean if you're sucking the boot of Alex Johnson really trying to get the

2565
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,432
The whole thing in your mouth

2566
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,968
As much of that Buddhism

2567
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:20,832
You can you're not doing good but paycheck better than huge

2568
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:23,136
Wolf

2569
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,416
I can't believe that

2570
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:28,000
So I think this was one of the Emmy was way worse than I think

2571
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:28,768
I expected

2572
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:36,704
Really and blindsided truly and honestly I hear expectations were low

2573
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:39,264
I'm fine with Glenn asking

2574
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,800
Family long question

2575
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,824
Cuz that's just how the

2576
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,848
Dolor en talks

2577
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,128
Get out

2578
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:44,896
This is

2579
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,664
Bad

2580
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,968
I mean

2581
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,248
It's almost

2582
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,552
I think those question

2583
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,088
Buy a broom

2584
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,440
They weren't thought

2585
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,232
Pull their work follow up

2586
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,536
Anyway

2587
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,608
I i find I find all of the

2588
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,888
This just

2589
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,424
Sewing

2590
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
Distasteful

2591
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,520
So I mean this brings us to the end of our Ark

2592
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,544
I guess with Alex

2593
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,080
War

2594
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,640
That documentary is

2595
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,200
Yeah it's dangerous

2596
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,480
Because

2597
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,528
It lends itself towards

2598
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,344
Mainstreaming Alex

2599
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,416
Voiced Alex upon an unsuspecting

2600
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,696
Expecting population

2601
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,720
Who is

2602
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,048
If you go into that documentary without an awareness

2603
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:34,816
So who he is

2604
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,864
Which many people probably will dissly

2605
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:41,216
I've heard this name checks documentary about him or something

2606
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,520
Or they know him is just the gay frogs guy

2607
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
Right yep you could

2608
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,592
Stan's two

2609
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,384
Very seriously

2610
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,688
Endanger somebody you buy

2611
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,736
Making them more likely

2612
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:53,504
Dubai in

2613
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,272
Into his s***

2614
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:57,088
Well what you're saying to the people who know him

2615
01:44:57,344 --> 01:45:00,416
Or don't know who known as the gay frog guy or don't know him at all

2616
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,440
Is yes

2617
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,256
Look at this man he's the gay frog guy

2618
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,792
But he's more than that

2619
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,584
He's a human who makes mistakes

2620
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,400
And he's a man with principled political stance

2621
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,680
And it's f******

2622
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,216
Bulshit it's all the LIE

2623
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,496
It's all bulshit

2624
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,520
And she sucks

2625
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:22,176
I think humanizing Alex is totally fine and I do think that one or two dimensional caricatures of him

2626
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:25,504
Are counterproductive a hundred percent agree with that

2627
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,552
I just don't think that that's what this is

2628
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,576
Now I think

2629
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:33,184
Has a an attempt to humanize the version of Alex that he wants people to see

2630
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,720
And that is not

2631
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,000
What a documentary

2632
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,328
You're not showing the accurate picture you're showing

2633
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,864
The dub the mass

2634
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:45,216
And not really giving any indication that it's a mask

2635
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:47,008
You're not giving like

2636
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
It's just

2637
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,080
Your f****** over your audio

2638
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
If you do that

2639
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,128
Glenn is 2

2640
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
Bandits

2641
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,200
Whatever I don't know

2642
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:57,760
Every right to do it but like

2643
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,040
Any kind of

2644
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,576
Pretensive like

2645
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,880
This is somehow challenging

2646
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,928
Piece of work that we're doing

2647
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:10,048
You're playing the recorder and pretending it's a tuba

2648
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,096
Or whatever

2649
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:14,400
You've created a Golem

2650
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,680
Alex Jones

2651
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:19,776
In order to allow the real Alex Jones to avoid con

2652
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
For his behavior

2653
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,336
That's what it is

2654
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,360
Yep

2655
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,128
And

2656
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,664
Let us not forget

2657
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,456
Quite sincerely

2658
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,552
This Q&A

2659
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
And this

2660
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,624
Premiere of this documentary

2661
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,672
What SEPTA happened just

2662
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,440
Before

2663
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,208
The trial

2664
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,232
Was to begin

2665
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,024
Glenn Greenwald

2666
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,816
Came to Austin

2667
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,096
To engage

2668
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,120
In a promotion

2669
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,168
With Alex

2670
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,448
Doing these soft

2671
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,984
Softball bulshit questions

2672
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,008
After this

2673
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,568
Peace and shallow documentary

2674
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,616
In the context

2675
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,664
The same city

2676
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,456
Right around the same time

2677
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:03,296
Is trying to avoid responsibility

2678
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,576
For his actions

2679
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,112
Visa V Sandy Hook

2680
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,392
And

2681
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
End

2682
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
Is

2683
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,744
Media Outlets

2684
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,024
Cheerleader for him

2685
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,560
In those effort

2686
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,096
Skip willingly

2687
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,632
Unwittingly

2688
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,216
Doesn't matter if you lie on purpose or not

2689
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:25,568
I guess that's really what it comes down to

2690
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,848
Glenn is saying

2691
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:31,968
It's a good thing that you keep saying you don't lie on purpose so I don't have to say I don't lie on purpose

2692
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,504
May I please

2693
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,296
So anyway

2694
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064

Will be back but until then I'm Neo I'm Leo I'm bzx Clark I'm Alex's m

2696
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,984
Empty bottle of vodka before you got on air

2697
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,288
The sex robot

2698
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:58,592
Holding

2699
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,224
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work
