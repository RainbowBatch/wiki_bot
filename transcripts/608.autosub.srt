1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for this knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,976
Hey everybody you welcome back to fight knowledge of Jordan

6
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,728
Alex Jones

7
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Whatsyourprice

8
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,128
We're great at dozen on the gun

9
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,760
I don't know how you have that restraint generally telling you

10
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
People are like Jordan do you get all your restraint Back In The Cut and you come in right

11
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,976
The right time to ask about the break

12
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Over 50

13
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,072
Hear about your brakes just wait until I say 2021

14
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
I don't know if you know this

15
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
But tomorrow

16
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,664
We're recording this on the 21st tomorrow is October 22nd

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,736
Right and that is the day that Dune is released

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
Is that right

19
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Do you want to go see it

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Should we go look like

21
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
Maybe we can probably go tonight

22
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,096
I do hope you go tonight we can go tomorrow

23
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
I guess so. I'll dress up as Duncan Idaho

24
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,312
It looks like it's great

25
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
Stewart's

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Interpretation

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
Stewart was Gurney halleck in David Lynch's very

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
Correct myself on that one

29
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
Goodnight Show week

30
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
We could go to

31
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
Okay well think rides go tomorrow

32
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
Go to bed now

33
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,472
My bright spot to Jordan

34
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
Ranger or our friend was in town very nice salon

35
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Always nice to see some

36
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Coming out

37
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,552
This is a bright spot upon a bright spot day for you.

38
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,184
Yes you got it right

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,488
Thank you you also could have said

40
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,072
I'd rather take a spice you could have said

41
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,192
Address business and were no actually that is sacrilegious

42
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
Oh

43
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
I can't mess with shai-hulud my lamp

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
I always blow it 9:00

45
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm excited

46
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
See this movie

47
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Felt this way this like sordid

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Excited about a movie since

49
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Mortal Kombat

50
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
In that like you didn't watch it

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,464
Yes I did

52
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
But it's not like real excitement

53
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Fake excited

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Sure sure

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Humped

56
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
Super Mortal Kombat I was disappointed

57
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Going to be disappointed by doing but I'm

58
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:03,712
I doubt it everything I've heard is that this is the Dune movie that you dance Pacifica

59
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,784
I've been waiting for a while

60
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
But we're not going to talk about doing today

61
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,280
As everybody is probably figured out by now this is a Jordan Apple

62
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Episode

63
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:23,423
Number five or six I think it's number 6 total and 5

64
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
So

65
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,871
Today it's going to be a little bit of a shorter episode but that is

66
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Is because

67
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
We are talking about

68
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
This is been something that we've probably needed to talk about for a long time

69
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
I've heard some Rumblings

70
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Probably the world needs

71
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
To talk about for a long time but

72
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
While researching this

73
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
I realized very quickly why

74
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Nobody Does this and that is because it is

75
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Is awful

76
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Tik-Tok is the worst

77
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Chasing the world

78
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,847
But I totally get why it's very very popular and we are going

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
To explore

80
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
I think I'm too old

81
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
I've had the same sort of feeling about it that I had with like

82
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Snapchat

83
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
That is like

84
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Kamehameha

85
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,743
No I was looking through the the person we're talking about today

86
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
Has well over three and a half million follow

87
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Right

88
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
And I'm going through this

89
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
With my old ass

90
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
Just like looking at these videos just going like

91
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
You know

92
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
This isn't how you're

93
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
You're supposed to do it

94
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,455
You're supposed to have a 20-minute Apple

95
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
You would have been the guy who likes all the early YouTube video

96
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
The Blogger who's mad at Twitter

97
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Microblogging nonsense

98
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
At least 1,000 words to explain everything

99
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,127
I'm my only exposure to take that really is my my friend. Angela

100
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Buried

101
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
Jason Smith

102
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
From time to time

103
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Ifun animal thing

104
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Robust

105
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Community of animals

106
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Videos

107
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Asbury

108
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
From what I can see

109
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
On Tik-Tok

110
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
There is a robust

111
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Community

112
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
For everything everywhere

113
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
And no one has any idea about the

114
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
The other ones on

115
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,703
I think it's I think it's probably one of the more insular

116
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Weird faces I've ever seen

117
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Like a lot of

118
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Sort of isolated bubble

119
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Yeah

120
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
You

121
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Isolated bubble

122
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
It would be like if

123
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
You know at the height of Carson

124
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,623
You know with 100 million people viewing a night or whatever you know something

125
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
Ridiculous number if you just met

126
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
AAA you know people who are

127
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,791
Just now started to watch David Letterman it never heard of cars

128
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Oh well

129
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Never heard of it like

130
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Who are you talkin

131
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Sing about there's only

132
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,007
What are you talkin about animal videos

133
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,639
Cancer is nonsense. There's no way that they would be bulshit on here

134
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
Well I mean I guess it's probably would Vine would have become if

135
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
State around

136
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Anyways

137
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
Before we talk about

138
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Tik-Tok

139
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
I think it's time for us to say to hello some

140
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,535
To us some new walk that's a great idea you came in at the right time there

141
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
Holding back

142
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,471
An action lion with a commercial driver's license or no

143
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
I'm a policy wonk

144
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
Lee

145
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Justly

146
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Ewok

147
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Likely

148
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
Next we have Joe Fox you are now a policy wonk

149
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
I'm a policy wonk

150
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
Allender is turd Anderson

151
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
That's probably a real name

152
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,583
I'm a policy wonk Anderson

153
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Technocrat who has assumed

154
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Related

155
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
It is pooping sinbon pooping

156
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
Heroin

157
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,159
Freakishly large

158
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
Little bit more scatological Wonka names today than normal I'm not I'm not thrilled with that

159
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Pacifically

160
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
We're going to get it out of the way we can get that I wish that I had like a scientists told you

161
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Hillbilly good

162
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
Well here's the episodes have to say

163
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
I am I have a little bit like

164
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,719
Norm Macdonald saying Turd Ferguson there sure

165
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
There is that

166
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
Today Dan

167
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,911
We are going to talk about little little ticktocker name to act

168
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Ty the crazy

169
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
The guy Jack

170
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
But not an it's not all

171
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
Ty the crazy guy in the crazy guy

172
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Wow menus

173
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Put the right out there

174
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
No

175
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
Is that there's a huge caveat here

176
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
Which is that I do feel like this is important to talk

177
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
But like most people on

178
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Tik-Tok we are going to be talking about a child

179
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,559
So it is a very thin needle to thread there without just being like

180
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,375
All kids are stupid

181
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
18

182
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
Okay well I mean technically

183
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
Majority is a safe

184
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
In his first video can join the Army

185
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,967
Vegan

186
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
The first video of this dude put out on

187
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
Tik-Tok I think you was like 16 years old

188
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
And it's essentially all what

189
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Most toxic

190
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
Tik-Tok videos are it's very short thing

191
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,815
And it's got him kind of like dancing and mugging

192
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Into the camera

193
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
There's music over it

194
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
And then you just point

195
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
And words appear on the

196
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Twitter I've seen people repost

197
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Those

198
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
The caption

199
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Simple

200
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Direct that's what everybody get

201
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Sure

202
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
And in his

203
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
It's basically like him saying like

204
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
I want to be

205
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Tik-Tok famous

206
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Can we make that

207
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
And then overtime

208
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
It appears without changing anything

209
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Or doing anything

210
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
Any different or having any discernible like

211
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Sing that word

212
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
Make him stand out

213
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
You know he just started getting more and more popular

214
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
People just kind of event

215
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Okay

216
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
This is what we call the the secret

217
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,735
Yeah yeah he manifested Twitter arto today

218
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,599
No he was like Hey I want to be Tik-Tok famous and apparently everybody on Tik-Tok was like

219
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
I guess

220
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,439
Let's just make this guy favorites

221
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,815
So he goes on for a year or so putting out these very very

222
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Simple similar videos

223
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
He's doing he's doing pretty well

224
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
Every now and again he'll go real viral

225
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
And he'll get like

226
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
200,000 views on water

227
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
You know

228
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Something something

229
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Open crazy and it's

230
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
It again

231
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,223
These are all just him like dancing and then pointing to words as they appear

232
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
I'd say it's your basic

233
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Internet meme Joe

234
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Very simple him being like

235
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,207
When I'm in class I feel like and then he makes a face and then

236
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
When you get it

237
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
Yaya

238
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
I have no idea who this

239
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
This person is

240
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
You're saying there's millions of followers

241
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Roseanne

242
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
It's so bizarre that

243
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
We don't have that centralized like

244
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Engine economy

245
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
Bananas right now

246
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
And again

247
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
Because we're talking about a kid I don't mean I'm not shiting on his

248
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,855
Is creative output or whatever you know that it's not like

249
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:15,487
I'm expecting him to be a have already instantly distance himself from his

250
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,607
F****** peers or whatever you know I'm not trying to be an a****** he hasn't changed the form

251
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
But he really doesn't have any like

252
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Pallet

253
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
He's just very

254
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
There and watchable

255
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
And I get it

256
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
I get what's going on

257
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
All of this is going along normally and then he

258
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
He puts out his

259
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Is first conspiracy

260
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Video

261
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
Instead of conspiracy

262
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Conspiracy

263
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
So he's drinking

264
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Auntie

265
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Spilling some of it probably you got it

266
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
First

267
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
Conspiracy theory conspiracy I refuse to figures

268
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
Comes out

269
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Insta

270
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Instantly

271
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
Right up over like 200,000

272
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,847
Now it's up over like a million two million or whatever it

273
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
And here is what

274
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Bought this kid into popular

275
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,503
The Kardashians are cursed by witches

276
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
We need to talk about this

277
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:16,671
In 1809 the Kardashians

278
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
For all future generations of the Kardashians to have faint

279
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
Power and wealth

280
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,079
The keeper

281
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
The past which is

282
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
Kardashian

283
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
Cheap airfare

284
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,415
Which explains the many many many exorcisms

285
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Before you met Carnage was a happy successful businessman

286
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Parasite

287
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Rehab

288
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,703
The Kardashians sacrifice their own Brothers

289
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
2014

290
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
That's okay that's quite

291
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
That's quite a bit of tea

292
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831
So he's got the pole he's got the PJ Peter BP Watson

293
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
Humpin around

294
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
The fast-paced

295
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Kind of necessary on

296
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Tik-Tok

297
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Yeah

298
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Oh really really cut

299
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Nice and quiet

300
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
You know what I hear when I when I was

301
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
Some of that is like a melding of

302
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Celebrity Obsession and

303
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Like

304
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Fairy Tail

305
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
That is exactly what it is

306
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
I will tell you where this conspiracy comes from

307
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
A fairytale

308
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Well in 2012

309
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
I believe February 2012

310
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Someone named

311
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Studio writer

312
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
Wrote this for Studio no

313
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
And it's why are the Kardashians

314
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
Famous own his whole conspiracy thing was OJ's lawyer

315
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,007
Hahaha okay

316
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
The biggest

317
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Suitcase

318
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,735
Televised

319
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,319
Do you think that Tik-Tok early two-year-old tiktokers like

320
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
Well they became famous because of OJ

321
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
Just doing Twitter

322
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Exactly

323
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Exactly

324
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,863
This was this whole story

325
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
It's called why are the Kardashians

326
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Famous

327
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
A dark history exposed Sono now

328
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
I'm going to read you some of

329
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
And you tell me

330
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
Do you think it's based in reality or not just

331
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
This is how it starts

332
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
So they the Kardashian

333
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
Stare at their great-grandmother

334
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Went to a gingerbread house

335
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Wait

336
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
In 1809

337
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
A dark-haired woman Strode through the deep forest d'Ivoire mean

338
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
The rain lasts down through the trees

339
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
The water making her robe

340
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Heavy and thick

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
But she was

342
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Determined

343
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
This

344
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
Is a ostensibly the very real accounting something that happened in 1809

345
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,151
I feel like this

346
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
Sourcing on this is probably

347
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
Aboveboard

348
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
Go on it goes on for quite some time

349
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,207
After a some very breathless description of her traveling habits

350
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
She's experiencing

351
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,839
The first and

352
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,751
Gnarled trees rose up from the earth like a tortured head

353
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Beyond the rough

354
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Clearing Beyond

355
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
The dark Earth

356
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
The mouth of a cave Gates like that

357
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
The throat of a bee

358
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
Beast Within faint traces of

359
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
Flame cast shadows in the death

360
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Ghostly treasure

361
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
I'd like to move

362
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
Alright so this is

363
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
100% Bass

364
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,255
I got caught up in the visuals are

365
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
Like a fairytale almost exactly like a fairytale

366
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
Here's how it is

367
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Switchmate

368
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Convince you that you might be right

369
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
So

370
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
The Twist on this

371
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Is that Keiko

372
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
Goes to the Four Witches

373
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
And one of them is named Rumpelstiltskin

374
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Close

375
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Very close she asks for

376
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
And and this is working

377
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
I want nothing more

378
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
Then Fame Fortune

379
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Shannon Beauty

380
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Brighton

381
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
So

382
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
They give her Fame Fortune

383
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Beauty

384
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Nothing more than

385
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,047
So they don't have talents or brands

386
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
The whole thing is one giant

387
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Dick

388
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,935
Just an a****** thing to say about why the Kardashians are famous

389
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
Cuz they're not flat they're not good

390
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,567
Cuz I made a deal with the witches in the 1800

391
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,895
It's this and the end because of that sexist

392
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
Rihanna

393
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
Is really awful

394
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:01,087
And this just has no idea that would include Robert Kardashian

395
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Ludacris

396
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
You wasn't that hot

397
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,887
I don't know if that was the real takeaway here

398
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Yeah that's

399
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
That's wild so someone just wrote this

400
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Bizarre

401
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Fanfiction that was basically two

402
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,711
Back in 2012 and now this person up Tik Tok

403
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Is a bring it out as a

404
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
Spilling the tea you better conspiracy about these

405
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
These famous

406
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
You got it

407
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Lamb is that nuts

408
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
I guess yeah yeah

409
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
It's sad

410
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
It's really sad

411
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
And here's a

412
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
Because a million people have watched it then

413
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
A couple of them at least we're like wow that's it

414
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Stick right

415
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Right

416
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
An end it

417
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,775
And here's the other thing you know when we talked about

418
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
Talking about some of these people who you don't know if

419
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
If they're trying to be funny or not

420
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
Yeah

421
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
I can see them conceivably

422
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,831
Being hidden behind that wall of well I'm Joe

423
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
This kid

424
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Exist

425
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
With a red light where there is no

426
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Distance between

427
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,119
There's never any distance between a joke and reality

428
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,935
There's no distance between fantasy and reality

429
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
All the same

430
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,287
He doesn't believe this

431
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
But at the same time he does believe it

432
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,383
But at the same time he doesn't believe

433
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,503
I kind of believe that you know

434
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Swings-N-Things

435
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
No I don't believe it

436
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Yeah that's the whole of what if

437
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Exact

438
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
It is not a

439
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Problem

440
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
For me like whenever I go through these things

441
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
The problem isn't so much

442
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
What information of what

443
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Conspiracy theories

444
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Disseminate

445
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Sure

446
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
It is that

447
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
He is removed

448
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
The line

449
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,263
Queen fantasy and reality

450
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
It's almost like

451
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
The content is what it is

452
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
But the presentation of it is

453
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Really damaged

454
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Because because

455
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
If you accept that

456
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Kind of

457
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
Way to take in information

458
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
What else are you going

459
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Susceptible to

460
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Because it's so short

461
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
You watch it

462
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,607
And it disappears and you don't even think about it again but he's up there so

463
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
No

464
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,191
The whole time I was thinking of

465
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,263
If you recall the we had a interaction one-time wear

466
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,591
I told you that I didn't want to drink the beer be

467
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
The temperature

468
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,431
And that was a thing that I'd always been told

469
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
That was real and you very correctly pointed out that that is an incredibly insane thing to think that's stupid

470
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,951
Beers are are stored at

471
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
At room temperature

472
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
You know but it's one of those unexamined little things that was

473
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Popped into my head

474
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
It's some point and I never thought about

475
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
Until it just pops out

476
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,495
We all have those things and you're never really able to

477
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
2

478
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
Confront them until you're aware of the exact

479
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
So these things

480
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,943
Just pop in and out like and then ears

481
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
The Conspirator

482
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Another glass

483
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Oh yeah

484
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
The Titanic

485
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
We need to talk about this

486
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,720
On the Titanic

487
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
One of which was the Olympic

488
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,864
Ticket just come back from a journey and had a lot of damage on it

489
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
So much that I really wasn't ever safe for it to go out again

490
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
The company switched

491
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Titanic

492
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Purposely crash

493
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
Insurance money

494
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
It sounds crazy but look at the proof

495
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,784
First off the Olympic has 16 portholes in the Titanic at 4

496
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
Picture of the alleged

497
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
Titanic

498
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,120
Which is literally a part of Olympics

499
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
The few survivors

500
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
The Titanic

501
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
Say anything

502
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
I don't like the we need to talk about

503
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,904
He says it every single time I got that I got was a catchphrase you find that annoying

504
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,208
This is why I told you this is the worst

505
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,816
How many of those and I heard him say that again and again and again

506
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:30,144
Yeah yeah this one is less like

507
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,728
Fairytale this is something you do here in

508
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
Conspiracy Circle zygote

509
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
This is something that

510
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
I know that we even talked

511
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
By virtue of

512
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
I think was a Bill Cooper episode

513
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,320
And I know that Alex believes that the Titanic was

514
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
Conspiracy

515
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Yeah that is

516
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
That's it

517
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
This is where that to that connect

518
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
That's that's

519
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
The thing you start

520
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
To see him

521
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
Because the first

522
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Conspiracy video

523
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
Get so many f****** life

524
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
He is incentivised

525
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
To keep going

526
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
All the sudden

527
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,592
Very short time he goes from like

528
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
Oh isn't it funny the Kardashians are which

529
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
To like

530
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
Now I'm getting into those

531
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Fringe

532
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
Conspiracy theories

533
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
And not the

534
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
I read on a message board

535
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
Even have the class

536
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Pronounce acquiesce

537
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Bright bright

538
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
Yeah I know I was a little disappointed by that

539
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
But I mean obviously this one's

540
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Very easy

541
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
Debacle

542
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Alright

543
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
The insurance

544
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,216
Wouldn't have covered the cost of the Titanic

545
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
So

546
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
DNC

547
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,872
Jake Kent blatant

548
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
Wrote a book on all the

549
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
The Titanic conspiracy theory

550
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
And his

551
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,016
His quote

552
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
The whole switch conspiracy founders

553
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
Quite literally

554
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
On its Financial merits alone

555
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
Which is a nice little that's a good little pun

556
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
He's got a nice little

557
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
The issue

558
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,216
Is like the conspiracy based on like what

559
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,520
Intentionally

560
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
For the insurance

561
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
Okay people still died on

562
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
And everything

563
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,432
Well they switch the boat

564
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
Right

565
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Because the Titanic

566
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,504
Couldn't have asked

567
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,088
Haha

568
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,672
No it's it couldn't sail because it was too is already bust

569
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
Sure didn't want the Titanic because it's the

570
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
About stunts

571
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
Sinkable ship ever

572
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
To go out and say

573
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
So they switched it

574
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
With another

575
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
In order to

576
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,264
Reclaim face in order to recoup the insurance losses on the

577
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Titanic

578
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Okay

579
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
And none of it

580
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
None of it makes any sense

581
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
And it wouldn't cover it

582
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
Bright light just from a business standpoint

583
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
Insurance quotes are very

584
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
Not interested in paying out when they don't have to

585
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Especially

586
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,048
I'm not just that but I get the money wouldn't if they would have lost money switching these things

587
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
What is it what

588
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
That's like somebody is in

589
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Hey I bet I bet

590
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,984
For about a hundred grand I could make a Titanic

591
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
Disappear like there's no other there's no other explanation for that

592
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
Nuts and it's and but

593
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
But the thing about that is that with this Tik-Tok video

594
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
It's 30 sec

595
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Edit you can go look

596
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
Intuit in 30 seconds and it'll all be gone

597
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
What that's not hurt it

598
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:35,232
Smile Tik Tok doesn't work where you watch a video and then you open a new tab

599
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
And look into it

600
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
I see about this just keeps playing

601
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:44,192
Just keep playing it more and more goes and more and more buildup so this was nothing

602
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
I heard it

603
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Google

604
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
Did they switch the time

605
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
Titanic was immediately like

606
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
No idiot

607
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
That was what Google

608
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
And then

609
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Here we go

610
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Another one

611
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
The birds in the sky

612
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
Actually surveillance cameras from the CIA

613
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
We need to talk about this

614
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:06,208
So in 1953

615
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
The surveillance by a lot

616
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
Replace them with fake fur

617
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
Watching her every damn move

618
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,032
Between 1951 and 1979

619
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Billion Berg

620
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,384
Silver 2 years the CIA

621
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,712
Christian airplane

622
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
50 gallons of bird poison

623
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,320
Sportsman's

624
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,280
Apple X years almost all the birds were dead

625
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
See what he heard

626
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,472
220 million so far in the best

627
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,544
The robot / 34 Lisa done such a good job that no one

628
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,360
Suspect

629
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Wow

630
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
Yeah shocking if true

631
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
Yeah this is just basic

632
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
The T-shirt sales

633
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,624
This was just this is just a viral marketing thing

634
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
It's real bad

635
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,000
And somehow also

636
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
He

637
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
He's getting

638
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Details of

639
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,120
The Conspiracy Theory wrong

640
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
We've got real

641
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,312
About the story the story actually goes

642
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
In the ER the most

643
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
Common 1in

644
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Are birds real

645
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
Conspiracy world

646
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Was rooted in

647
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
Just like

648
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
Like a like a like a

649
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Was it today

650
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,416
Bumper sticker poster t-shirt scam

651
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Darius

652
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Allen Dulles

653
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
You know a guy who needs fake

654
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,424
Conspiracy theories about it

655
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,824
Boy is evil real ones kind of Mickey

656
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,944
He's in he's like we got to we got to watch everybody

657
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
And the story is because

658
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
Hughes

659
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Place to be

660
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
B-52 bombers

661
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,928
And taking them from having all these bombs

662
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
To having 400

663
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
50 Ford

664
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
5400

665
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Gallon

666
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,888
They were like I don't know why that

667
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
And then some fix

668
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,984
Scientist from fake Area 51 we're like

669
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Oh we know why that happened

670
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Sure and then d

671
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Theoretical quote

672
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
Theoretical quotes right

673
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
From

674
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
Jefferson actually right

675
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,208
The first head of the CIA

676
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
D it was

677
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
Theoretically Alvin beat

678
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
Cleaver the internal communication

679
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Director

680
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
His phone was too

681
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
This article

682
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Was far more measured

683
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,056
Cleaver is believed to have said

684
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
Quote

685
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,992
Which is killed about 1.1 billion so far

686
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
And the best thing is

687
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,880
The robot Birds we've released in their place have done such a good job

688
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
That nobody even

689
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Suspects a thing

690
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,512
Doesn't that just seem so real

691
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
I'm very

692
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Marysville

693
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
I think there's some

694
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,192
Technological hurdles

695
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
That don't make sense

696
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
Especially considering

697
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
This would have been in the 60s

698
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
Assertive

699
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,688
Robot technology that we would have had at that point

700
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
Probably not that great

701
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
One of the things that people don't take him to

702
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Consideration Lotto time

703
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
With the robotics

704
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:52,256
Not so good outside when it rains that's a problem the birds are real high

705
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Just got her way up there

706
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,120
They could fall out at any moment in time

707
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,984
Live outside

708
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
To be a bad place for a robot to live

709
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Now here's the thing about this kid

710
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
That I do find

711
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
Truly.

712
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,528
Like this is something that is and it's really indicative on this clips

713
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Alright in the act

714
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Toolkit

715
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
Conspiracy theory

716
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
You know all the birds died

717
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Right and I said

718
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
They wiped out bird

719
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Gave them a disease

720
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
And then they would die in 24 hours

721
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
In the real

722
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Conspiracy theory

723
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
Their bones melted within 24

724
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
Their bones dissolve

725
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,128
Now when you have that as part of the story you're like so you're telling me that in 1950

726
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
T3 Allen Dulles had bone melting technology to be fairy

727
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
Only worked on

728
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Cuz they have

729
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
British Airways

730
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
They have weak bones

731
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Yeah

732
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
So if you leave that part out

733
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
And you just have

734
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Do they all die

735
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
Then you can make up any number of reason

736
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Sure

737
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
A disease that got a thing they've got a thing

738
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
In the actual story is it

739
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
It's cold

740
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Their bones melt

741
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,336
Sure I think that the other thing that's a disservice

742
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
It's kind of dangerous about

743
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
This

744
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Sort of information

745
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Dissemination

746
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Scheme

747
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:22,624
Is that this case in particular like Allen Dulles is somebody who like

748
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:27,744
There's real things to look at he's truly one of the most evil dude you could look at

749
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
Things that are real are not as fun as he

750
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
Kill the bird

751
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Kids to watch

752
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,192
Do you know what you're not as fun as that and I think

753
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
You know how Jack

754
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
Getting the attention

755
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,824
In that direction does a disservice to like real-world issues

756
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Is 100

757
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Yeah only

758
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Gets people to look more at the

759
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
Why wants to be

760
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,272
Tik-Tok

761
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,368
You know it's such a weird thing for him to have completely succeeded at

762
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,000
And then here we go this is this is what I want to this is almost like a rap

763
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Spitfire

764
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Situation here so

765
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,632
This next one is so

766
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
Incredibly

767
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Stupid okay

768
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
Just just

769
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,288
This is how you can tell if the FBI has tapped

770
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,616
Come to your phone and is watching you

771
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Where's your phone app

772
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Your phone

773
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,464
Normal

774
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Everyday

775
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
Is the conspiracy

776
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Actually sounds

777
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Dangerous

778
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Like

779
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Kind of

780
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,312
No and there's no explanation just being like hey

781
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,712
Texas into your phone right now to see if the FBI's happened you confirm whether or not you're in danger

782
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
Battery. Might as well have been him being like there's hot singles in your area it's the same f****** thing

783
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
And if you watch him

784
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Why not do it

785
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
Couldn't hurt

786
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
You think

787
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Totally

788
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,520
They're not going to open up a tech magazine howtogeek and be like

789
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
Oh okay that's

790
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
Just the interrogation code

791
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
That says if your forward call forwarding is on

792
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,016
That's that's what the number is Solvang

793
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
It's benign

794
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
Atleast it's not something where

795
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
Like you could have somebody

796
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,208
Collecting your phone number or

797
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Luckily it's benign

798
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
But this is

799
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
This is out of

800
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Control there's almost

801
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,936
I can't I don't know what would be stopping somebody from not having

802
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
That number just

803
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
It's not been

804
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Something

805
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
That's malicious

806
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
And it doesn't matter

807
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
If you if it's

808
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,408
Obvious or not or if

809
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,784
If you are somebody who's smart enough not to if there's a million-and-a-half use on his Tik-Tok

810
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
With him saying

811
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
Put this into your phone right now yeah a lot of

812
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
People are going to do it

813
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
Or even

814
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
It could be someone's

815
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Remember it could be a

816
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
Tulip targeted harassment

817
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
There's that there's so many ways to be abused yeah

818
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
You know there's a lot of things

819
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
And we need to talk about

820
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
Sorry

821
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,224
Then we go into this

822
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
This is like

823
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:36,416
I kinda want to play these really really close to each other so we're going to talk a little bit in between each other

824
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
Yeah the next three okay

825
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Controlling

826
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Okay so today

827
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
The 1940s from the government

828
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
Countries

829
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
People's teeth whiter

830
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,248
The government never responded around 75 per-cent of

831
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
Restart

832
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,256
Is basically proving that impact

833
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,608
Basic musically

834
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,448
Intelligence

835
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:27,360
I'm through the tap water

836
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Something

837
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Amazing baby that's just

838
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Literally an Alex Jones

839
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
Yep and it's just there

840
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,864
30 seconds from the guy who you were like

841
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
I'll just put

842
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:54,496
Number into my f****** phone and then I'll just do what this guy

843
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
F****** says

844
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,664
We've need that neutrality 4tiktok the opposing voice

845
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Bird

846
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,272
30 seconds must be given to the alternate

847
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,904
3.0 tons of his videos that have like the

848
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
Covid misinformation thing I pay back

849
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Yeah

850
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
And it's and it's

851
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
It's not malicious

852
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,376
Kid isn't in a meme kitten isn't like a far-right

853
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168
He's a he's a

854
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,472
Young he's got tons of

855
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,312
This dude is just a

856
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
Livius yeah he doesn't know what he

857
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,944
He's doing it's pretty easy to see how

858
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,736
A lot of the ideas

859
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
Accepted by the audience

860
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Would lead someone

861
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Closer and closer

862
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
Do right wing

863
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
Territory

864
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
Play the next

865
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
Okay

866
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
You got

867
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,792
Thank you this is the truth of how Halloween started

868
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,864
We need to talk about this

869
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,680
Over 2000 years ago

870
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,264
Samhain Festival

871
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
The Pope Gregory the 4th

872
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
October 31st for unknown reasons

873
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,344
Robert Parish

874
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,928
Retail on Halloween

875
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,632
Reset to the Overworld

876
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
People's houses

877
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
Didn't get free food

878
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
The trick-or-treating now with kids

879
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Keep himself safe

880
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,736
People are people from the Overworld so they wouldn't be targeted by the actual people looking for Souls

881
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
Costumes for Halloween

882
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,600
Came from conspiracy

883
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
What's the Overworld

884
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,000
Life I guess

885
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:57,888
Mortal Kombat the outer world

886
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
No end

887
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
This one

888
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,472
Conspiracy

889
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Not a dark history

890
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Turtle Back Zoo

891
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
To Fairy Tail

892
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
Territory even then it's just kind of like

893
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
And at it

894
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
More like a mainstream

895
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Siri of where of our

896
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
Modern Halloween

897
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
Celtic salmon

898
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
And the pope kind of co-opted it

899
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
All of this kind of crap

900
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
Kind of

901
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
If you look into it

902
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Then you would look into it and you be like

903
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,168
He got a more-or-less kind of what people would say is better

904
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
Can call that number

905
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
Exactly

906
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:41,152
Exactly episode is not

907
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
Is not dark

908
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
It's not it it's just

909
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
It's just a thing

910
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
You know he's just telling you a fact

911
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,088
Oreo released like a factual hypothesis

912
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
I am just

913
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
And he just mixes that in there with the rest

914
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
The b*******

915
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
There's no difference between them

916
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Nope

917
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Keeps

918
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
F****** going and this is the thing about

919
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
It is

920
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Not

921
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
Done

922
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
It is accelerating

923
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
Sure and it's going through

924
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Well

925
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,944
Listen to this crazy Illuminati game from the 90s Maita predicted the future

926
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
We need to talk about the Illuminati

927
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,648
New World Order

928
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Predict the future

929
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,976
Now corsaut the time now

930
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Does from the Illuminati button

931
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,192
Specific order but the specific chain of nine cards

932
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
Is so accurate

933
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,032
It's crazy the first one is rewriting history the second is

934
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,336
Terrorist nuke in the third is pentagon

935
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:49,504
To clean now we have population reduction Center for Disease Control an epidemic

936
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,344
Quarantine in it

937
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,184
When is the last three is what's going to happen in the near future

938
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Combined disasters

939
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,768
Kill for peace and tape

940
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:08,448
It seems like there's going to be a rebellion against the police system which is already starting and I don't even know what this last one

941
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
Today's conspiracy

942
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,544
Fun fun fact right behind you

Putting this in their beehive everyday Illuminati cards are

945
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,320
Behind

00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,160
Behind your head Thursday the frog god

947
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
There's also big

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,168
Epicenter for weird studies the hammer of Thor

951
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,544
Conveniently ignored when people talk about the

952
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,688
I mean he did bring up the fiendish Florida Gators already that's definitely there

953
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
The Clone arrangers

954
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,808
Red Birch Society dinosaur

955
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
Yeah exactly

956
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Very

957
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:06,560
Very nice way to get around copyright Godzilla

958
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:12,192
I can't run can't read Atomic monster that right yeah right next to next to Dinosaur Park

959
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
Yeah yeah fun

960
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Yep so

961
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,800
That's the thing about this

962
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,176
The thing that I kept thinking about whenever we're going through this clip is like

963
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
He is

964
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,808
Kind of almost systematically scouring the internet

965
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Newark

966
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
Conspiracy theories

967
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
But they're all the same old

968
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
So it's almost like he's he's

969
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
Creating this like

970
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
Scrunched up

971
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Version of the past

972
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
30 years of conspiracies

973
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,704
All in this easily digestible 32nd format

974
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
People who are unsuspecting to listen

975
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,336
It's Illuminati card game

976
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,663
Yeah I know you kind of have to assume that

977
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,711
Like if the workflow is Bass

978
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
Physically he's got to find

979
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,343
These incentivized to find new things to Spill the tea

980
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
He about as it were

981
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,767
Eventually you're going to end up in Holocaust denial

982
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,351
Eventually you're going to run out of things that are that are

983
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Like interesting

984
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,655
Quotes to your audio

985
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
And right now you're going

986
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Going to find

987
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Way more

988
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,615
F***** up conspiracy look at the Illuminati card game to the Illuminati drink children's blood

989
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Bright right

990
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,967
I do love those in that there's something really hilarious

991
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
But like

992
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,295
The Illuminati put out this card game

993
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:38,207
And no one believed it because

994
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Whatever like

995
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
The Illuminati is like they have a press release like

996
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
Shut up aluminum

997
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
Again with the Illuminati

998
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:51,263
Yeah they're notoriously unreliable as a source

999
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
That's great

1000
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
Yeah I mean

1001
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
It's it's bananas

1002
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,551
You know he he's also kind of Iowa I'm going to skip the

1003
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
Okay let's play the next

1004
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
Okay I'll play that one real

1005
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:12,767
Aliens on Earth

1006
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
Okay

1007
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:21,471
Huge metal in the middle of Utah

1008
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,695
Species from another planet on Earth

1009
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,839
Call Monical's in Utah

1010
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
Pentagon released footage

1011
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,191
Possible UFO sightings

1012
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
We talked about it

1013
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:04,991
It's because the information was getting released from the inside

1014
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
Is today's conspiracy

1015
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,367
I can't wait for him to find out that they use real dinosaurs in

1016
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,951
Dinosaur park

1017
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,815
This one and the other was interesting to me because I

1018
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,119
Do remember the monitor the monitor

1019
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:24,191
They did discover a monolith

1020
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
In Utah

1021
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
And it was the talk of the internet for the day

1022
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Sure it was one of those

1023
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,127
Reddit user Tim slang

1024
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,407
Pinpointed the

1025
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,943
Coordinates so the the

1026
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
SparkPeople

1027
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Didn't tell Everett anybody where it was

1028
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
Rightly thinking

1029
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,343
Crazy people just show up

1030
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,647
Right up and then f*** over

1031
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Native indigenous population sure

1032
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Protected land

1033
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,071
So what day of course forgot was that the internet was going to find

1034
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
It's just going to have

1035
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
Well because they've got the robot

1036
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
They can just happened everything

1037
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
And you know

1038
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,031
The other thing that I used that you didn't use

1039
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Robot

1040
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Switchers entry

1041
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
He used Google Earth

1042
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
Turns out you don't need robot

1043
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,991
But you know how we developed Google Earth

1044
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:14,367
So he uses historical Imaging from Google Earth

1045
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
Triangulates where it is

1046
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,951
And then they figure out

1047
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
When it was

1048
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Placed in there

1049
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,303
Somewhere between August 2015

1050
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
October 26th

1051
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Alright

1052
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
Not entirely sure when it happened

1053
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
Probably part of the trunk

1054
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,007
Campaign well roughly around that time

1055
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,847
The Epic sci-fi drama Westworld was filming in a nearby

1056
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,711
So the best at the moment is that someone on the crew either didn't pack up properly

1057
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,015
Or maybe even use the metal slab

1058
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
To play a long-term

1059
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Kubrick expire

1060
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Wow

1061
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
That's from CNET

1062
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,487
It's been used the location that they're specifically.

1063
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
The filming location for

1064
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
The longest

1065
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
4 tons of sci-fi

1066
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,679
Classic westerns going all the way back so yeah

1067
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
It is not a super huge

1068
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
Terrifying conspiracy

1069
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Certainly not

1070
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,895
Nope and those government videos of the UFOs are pretty much

1071
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,503
Everybody kind of figured that one out quick

1072
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,319
The same thing that we see in Alex so often of the

1073
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
Melding of faint

1074
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,391
Tennessee in reality like movies movie

1075
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,951
Movies being treated as if

1076
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
If they were real

1077
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,815
That's so fascinating that that's just such a

1078
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,143
Cutest thing yeah the blending that the inability to tell the difference

1079
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
It is

1080
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
Is really kind of

1081
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
F***** up

1082
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,055
But the ability to mix

1083
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
Them together

1084
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
Is terrified

1085
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
You know

1086
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
The ability to remove

1087
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
From others

1088
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,991
How to differentiate

1089
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,855
Essentially the unwillingness to three things as they are

1090
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
Absolutely

1091
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
How to draw the line

1092
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
Now the other thing that he does

1093
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
Is almost you know he's done

1094
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,327
A ton of videos on the Mandela effect

1095
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:05,215
That whole thing that one's funny yeah I mean it's it's very annoying but this one I did find it

1096
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
Okay

1097
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:13,919
Different dimension in 2021

1098
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
2020

1099
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:22,111
People not just because

1100
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,303
2021 we're all transported back to our original dimension

1101
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,447
Okay number one was talked about the New Year's Eve ball drop so if you're watching

1102
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:49,247
Dimension to the other nms of the time

1103
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,447
Wow yeah

1104
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Yeah

1105
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
Here's why this isn't

1106
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
That

1107
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
What is one of the ones that

1108
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,199
Felt more clear these f******

1109
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Blankets

1110
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
That that

1111
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,087
To me is like okay you're taking this seriously

1112
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
He's not even

1113
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
Exactly

1114
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,183
Zumiez

1115
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
The bummer

1116
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Here's the other

1117
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
He is taking it

1118
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
In a very

1119
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
Weird hat

1120
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
Serious way he's mocking VI

1121
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,959
Idea that we are in a and alternative

1122
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
What he is

1123
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,359
Actually like serious about that

1124
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Is

1125
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:48,895
Mandela

1126
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
Tri-City said he was obsessed with

1127
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,783
Yeah so the Fruit Loops stuff

1128
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,599
It is something that he believes

1129
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,647
But the alternate

1130
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
Stuff is something that he's obvious

1131
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Joking about

1132
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,535
Yeah somehow they're both in the same 30

1133
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
F****** sex

1134
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
You can

1135
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
You can

1136
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,143
You have a limited amount of time

1137
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,447
And you have to deal with

1138
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Stuff

1139
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,799
Exactly the same that you care about Evan is a joke

1140
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,431
That's disoriented really f***** my head up all of

1141
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,247
And the thing that interested in this is I was like

1142
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,319
There's definitely an explanation for this fruit loop ship

1143
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,415
Losing their minds aren't generally is 4

1144
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Mandela effect

1145
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
Text

1146
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,279
I mean I've looked into it and

1147
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,327
Fruit Loops was originally called

1148
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Froot Loops

1149
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
Spelled like fruit

1150
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
Alright 1959

1151
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Now

1152
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
Before they

1153
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
Continue with that

1154
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
There was a lawsuit

1155
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,103
From

1156
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
Who is like hey

1157
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
There's no f****** fruit

1158
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,247
You can't call it Fruit Loops

1159
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
You will

1160
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
You make people think there's fruit in it

1161
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
So they had to change

1162
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
Did the 20

1163
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
That's it

1164
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,975
It's always been that way since 1959

1165
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Or

1166
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
Or

1167
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
We live in a

1168
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,351
Alternative

1169
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
For you and now we're back

1170
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
To the normal one

1171
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,935
I mean well you know

1172
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,495
You thought covid was what bit but he was it a

1173
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
Mature

1174
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,359
Yep I was interested to find out

1175
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
We're Fruit Loops

1176
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
Yeah yeah I think

1177
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,199
I think that if you take the time

1178
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
Almost everyone

1179
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Of those

1180
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
Weird

1181
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
Mandela effect

1182
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Is very

1183
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Explainable

1184
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Although it does it does

1185
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
Exploit

1186
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
Something that is

1187
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
Really Universal is like

1188
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
Wait a second

1189
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,095
I thought it right thought this happen

1190
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,655
Powerful feeling

1191
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
That you can

1192
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,959
You can manipulate people with

1193
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,775
Especially if you put it in the same videos

1194
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
This other stuff that

1195
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
Bulshit

1196
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,895
You are a giving people this feeling of like

1197
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,199
You're right that's not what I thought it was

1198
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
Wait I thought it was

1199
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,063
Berenstein Bears so now I'm in the state of life

1200
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,367
Now I don't know what things

1201
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Used to be

1202
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:11,743
Sure and you end up entering a space where you distrust your own perception

1203
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Oh that's

1204
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
That's dangerous

1205
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
Oh yeah

1206
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
Yep yep

1207
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,399
I would

1208
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:24,543
The last clip is we don't need we don't need to do that one again essentially the clip is just him saying like

1209
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
Is Mars getting less red

1210
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,663
And then conspiracy theories for why we don't

1211
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,711
See it it's it's not as red as it is

1212
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,271
Picture and the obvious answer to that is

1213
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
It's not red

1214
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
It never was

1215
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
Ocean verret

1216
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
OSHA

1217
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,183
And then he goes on to say did you know

1218
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Right

1219
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,511
That humans used to live on Mars

1220
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
And then they took all the resources

1221
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
And moved to Earth

1222
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
And then

1223
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,471
Alright what they're going to do is they're going to take all of the resources from Earth

1224
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
I move back tomorrow

1225
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,591
Totally makes sense

1226
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
That is

1227
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,431
Essentially the plot of Mission to Mars

1228
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Starring Gary

1229
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,015
It is again that movies

1230
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Confused with real real

1231
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,087
Like over and over and over again

1232
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Yep

1233
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
Now the thing that

1234
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
It's me about

1235
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,999
This kid and again it's a it's a it's a it's a child

1236
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,303
I'm not going to to be like

1237
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
But with these videos

1238
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
So often

1239
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,471
This is just a theory

1240
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,751
Please no one come out

1241
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,383
You know I am in no way claiming this is real just a theory I don't want anyone coming after

1242
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
This level of like

1243
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
I'm going to say my b*******

1244
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,783
And I'm going to give myself this

1245
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Distance of like

1246
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
I I don't have to

1247
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,879
I don't have to

1248
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:49,279
Account for any of this don't come after me you know I'm just taking other people's ideas repackaging them for you

1249
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,863
You and you're somehow calling me a member of this problem

1250
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
I'm take

1251
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:59,775
These ideas that are patently ludicrous and doing no due diligence in terms of

1252
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,359
Disseminating with the

1253
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,431
Caveat that like this isn't true

1254
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,063
But right here is the reality

1255
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Instead

1256
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,415
Instead I'm just going to funnel it to you it with a wing

1257
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,463
And like maybe it's real

1258
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:25,119
Responsible for the same time I'm going to put stuff that is just regular old

1259
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,191
Mainstream information out there you know the regular stuff

1260
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:32,799
And I'm just going to mix those all together and I'm not going to take responsibility for a single thing about it

1261
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
This is the thing

1262
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
The

1263
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
Andrea Marks Road

1264
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,687
Goats Rolling Stone article

1265
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
About

1266
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,271
Tik-Tok and how it's you know

1267
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
Going insane

1268
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,087
So they talk to she talk to

1269
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,135
And he said

1270
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,695
I've always from a young age been really obsessed

1271
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,255
With the what-ifs and things that don't seem like reality

1272
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,351
Different sample the holy unsubstantiated theory that Wayfair traffic

1273
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Children

1274
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,679
One that was circulated widely in qanon

1275
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
Right

1276
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,751
It's something that I read about

1277
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
This is Andrea

1278
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,079
Tiret about that and it

1279
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
Genuinely trouble

1280
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Quote

1281
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,991
From TY I came across an article about it that made me concerned until I thought

1282
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
Posting it with

1283
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
Spread that

1284
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,159
Adding that he had not realized the theory is popular among qanon who believe a satanic pedophile

1285
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
Call teze

1286
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,511
And then he just says I didn't even know it's like a very white ring

1287
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,047
Right-wing theory if I'm being honest

1288
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
And that

1289
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Is such

1290
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,399
Most chilling s***

1291
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703
To hear from a person with

1292
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,495
10 million views on a

1293
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Conspiracy video

1294
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,799
Yeah yeah because

1295
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
You do like

1296
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
It seems like

1297
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
A point that a thing

1298
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,175
It should be made it like it's less about

1299
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
Him

1300
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
And it's more about

1301
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
This

1302
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,599
This information dissemination

1303
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,879
Technique and strategy

1304
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
Is being used

1305
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
Quite effectively luntik

1306
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
Like

1307
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,303
You do end up like

1308
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,839
Oops

1309
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:05,727
I accidentally did a blood libel

1310
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,567
I wasn't even that I wasn't trying to and I believe that he probably wasn't

1311
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
I'm trying to

1312
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,639
I'll but the effect that it can have

1313
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,663
Is equivalent to

1314
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
We did

1315
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
M2

1316
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,271
Yeah I was I was

1317
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
Was trying to come up with like a

1318
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,111
Conclusion like a summary of

1319
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
What it what what does

1320
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,927
What is this mean and what is it

1321
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,743
It should be what should we take away from it

1322
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
I mean he's an eighteen-year-old kid

1323
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:34,143
He started this when he was 16 all he wants to do is be famous on Tik-Tok and he did it

1324
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
Yeah good for him

1325
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
She found

1326
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,775
The wave that destroys the world to become famous on Tik-Tok

1327
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
Just bread

1328
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,359
Bulshit conspiracy theories and get famous for it

1329
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
And

1330
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:51,039
Again it's not like his fault he's not maliciously doing anyting he's not writing or faking or making

1331
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
Not b******* right right

1332
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
Yeah

1333
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,647
It's it's

1334
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
. like a negative thing

1335
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
He's doing it

1336
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:02,815
The absence of the positive element that he needs to

1337
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Exact

1338
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
It's a it's a

1339
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
The crime of omission

1340
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:11,263
And the more I kept going the more is like maybe there's there's something about the interview no like

1341
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
Maybe we should

1342
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
I have a life

1343
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,383
It's like we do for Car-X

1344
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,711
And the more I thought about it the more I've just come to the kind of

1345
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,735
Conclusion that

1346
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,319
I don't think Humanity can engage with the internet response

1347
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
As a whole

1348
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,159
Yeah I don't think it's just I don't think it's possible

1349
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,255
I wonder about that myself like I think early on what are you doing this

1350
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
This bike has like my

1351
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
Prescription for everything

1352
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
Was just like education

1353
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,447
And I think that is still definitely something that's very important but

1354
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,495
But I don't know if that's

1355
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,519
Necessarily the

1356
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
The full deficiency

1357
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
Our brains

1358
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Do you know we've had

1359
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,175
Thousands of years of

1360
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
Development

1361
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,735
The the introduction

1362
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
Turn of the internet

1363
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,783
And the way that information

1364
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
And can be spread

1365
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
It's Sonu

1366
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
And so his ass

1367
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,927
Right and we may not have caught up

1368
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,463
Not maybe

1369
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,047
Able to maybe we will be better

1370
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,071
Eventually but

1371
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
No see that's

1372
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
That's why if I

1373
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,447
Felt like it was really important to go to Tik-Tok

1374
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
And see what

1375
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
The kids are

1376
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,519
To a certain extent

1377
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:20,383
Old names what are the kids doing

1378
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
He didn't start

1379
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
When he was 25

1380
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,759
Right right you started on

1381
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:31,135
Somewhere you started in what it would be the accessible medium of the

1382
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
The time which was local Access TV

1383
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
You know that there's the

1384
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
What would you do what you can

1385
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
And back then

1386
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
You get

1387
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
A platform

1388
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,215
The internet didn't exist The Gatekeepers

1389
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:50,335
Do a broadcast television wouldn't allow you on so you got to go to local access

1390
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Now you have

1391
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Tik-Tok you have so many

1392
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
Internet

1393
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,455
Platforms

1394
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
Where you can build your own thing

1395
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
Yeah yeah

1396
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,575
Yeah yeah I know I just I just feel like

1397
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
What I'm watching

1398
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
When I see this this kid is

1399
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
The ultimate

1400
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
Reality that

1401
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
The internet

1402
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
In the real world cannot

1403
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Coexist

1404
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
Because he's trying to make them

1405
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,887
He's trying to exist both

1406
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,935
Fantasy and reality

1407
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Taneous Lake

1408
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,287
And have it not be harmful to anyone you know and you just can't

1409
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
You just can't

1410
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,847
You know like I don't

1411
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
I think

1412
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Should

1413
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,479
Do this I don't think you should

1414
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:34,623
Stopped I don't know if I have I shouldn't you know if somebody should not allow him to do this but I don't

1415
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,927
I think he I think if he was

1416
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
Thoughtful person

1417
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
He could really get

1418
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,279
Get through cuz he's not an insane

1419
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
You know

1420
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Far-right

1421
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,095
Nut Job

1422
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
Kind of guy

1423
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,447
Something like if he was like really just educated himself

1424
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,983
She would himself come to the

1425
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,775
Conclusion what I'm doing

1426
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335
Yeah

1427
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
Yeah it's

1428
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
I don't understand

1429
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
You can't even conceive of

1430
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
How you would set up

1431
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
System where people are not allowed

1432
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,319
To get off track

1433
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,599
Pretty quickly

1434
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,391
I think we need to

1435
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,951
Do a better job of

1436
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,255
Make it helping people recognize

1437
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
The actually what they're doing

1438
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,167
You know you're making a choice to do something and you think the choice you're making

1439
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,191
To do this

1440
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,239
You you might think that this is neutral

1441
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
Right

1442
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Actually bad

1443
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
You don't realize

1444
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,455
It's not your fault that you're 18 years old what do you know about f****** Fury

1445
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:36,575
You know like how would you be like oh well HL Mencken said you know like what are you talking

1446
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Do you educate

1447
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,207
But it's really weird

1448
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,047
We have gone to the land of Tik-Tok

1449
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
And it is

1450
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,959
Except for the parts with a cute animal

1451
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
That part is

1452
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,151
I'm not Faking It episode about somebody posted

1453
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,223
The cute little horse in the cat that get along come on

1454
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
It's so fun

1455
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:10,879
Yeah I appreciate you bringing this to the to the our attention you know like

1456
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,439
Definitely a space that

1457
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
I ignore

1458
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,023
But it's not irrelevant to everybody

1459
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,559
I think it's

1460
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
Hugely relevant and I think it's

1461
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
It's very impenetrable

1462
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
4

1463
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
The rest of

1464
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
Society

1465
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,751
Like I'm you know you

1466
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,335
You don't see people writing too much about

1467
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
Tik-Tok

1468
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,407
Just because you don't I don't even know how

1469
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:38,783
Like I didn't even know how to put this episode together cuz it's like oh well what are we going to talk about 30 seconds

1470
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,111
It's very difficult to kind of get a handle on

1471
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
Yeah yeah

1472
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
So here we are

1473
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,511
Well thank you thank you Dan for letting me you do this

1474
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,583
I appreciate you stepping in

1475
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,631
And taking a swing

1476
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,471
But I'll be back on Monday

1477
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
