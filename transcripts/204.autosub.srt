00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,128
Work

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,432
Yes sir

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
First video game

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,344
Justin Lee My grandma likes play video game

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
Little bit of a

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,512
What you do is she would get the video game stats

8
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
Play it's all the game she wanted to play and then

9
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Some came out

10
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
He would give us the old

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,496
So I got an Intel like that

12
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
At least that was the story

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
She bought us a Nintendo and that was sort of like what she

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,176
Send it

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,808
Remind me original

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,184
A lot of Mario Super Mario Brothers 3

17
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
My parents

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
They hated television

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
Video game

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm so me and my brother were allowed

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,400
Play half an hour of video games

22
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Or an hour if you play together so we would generally try and find ways to play together

23
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104
What is kind of difficult

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Single player

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,808
You got to keep doing it over and over

26
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,136
That's why I was such a revolution Nintendo came out

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
Donkey Kong Country

28
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
It was on

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,536
Because that was a super fun cartoony game like my parents wouldn't allow it

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,120
Yeah we had the super cartoony fun platform game

31
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
With two players

32
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,240
And I'd like

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
But of course my brother

34
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Maybe daddy

35
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Whatever

36
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,736
Call families R Us

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
One of the reasons why I was like I have

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Play every Donkey Kong Country

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
Comes out

40
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Nostalgia

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
And like warm

42
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,768
Is because all of those times that I spent playing with my brother

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
That's super we boy

44
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
It was of the devil

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
Destroying

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
Revolution

47
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
No it's not yourself

48
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,896

49
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200

59
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,736

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Two of The Wire

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,136
Greek himself

62
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,048

The time for Wacky Wednesday

68
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,256
As we're calling it

69
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Consulted on that

70
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,143
It's not alright alright

71
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
Talk about project

72
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,799
Camelot have a ton of new listeners who

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
And some people may be slightly

74
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,783
Confused by why we cover Project Camelot which is

75
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
About the secret space program a crazy weirdo

76
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Who show up the carry

77
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Just believes every

78
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Some people might not understand

79
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Connection to Alec

That we talked about

83
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
And I think today is

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Episode is going to do an amazing job

85
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Verbally

86
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Laying out

87
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Why we do this

88
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Why are these worlds

89
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
I think you'll see as this goes along

90
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Exactly

91
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
Psychiatric

92
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879

00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
Concrete

103
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Now there is

Gets on your plate

115
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Jordan

116
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
In the last

117
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,687
Little bit sport of interviewing Eddie page

Is in prison

125
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
If you can't talk to him as much as

126
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
There's an opening for someone else to come in

127
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
MP her

128
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847

00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,095
You have no Backbone in your old willing to let Terry sort of guide

137
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,959
Narrative

138
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
Pretty f****** races

139
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,871
The idea that Kerry Cassidy has not come back up on the

140
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431

Owl

147
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:10,751
If we don't, it's not going to get out into the mainstream news death

148
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,823
To our listeners

149
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
So every page is a Canadian whistleblower and I should be around

150
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
My fourth or fifth interview with him

151
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399

What's going on

195
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,719
All planetary systems in this galaxy

196
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
He is coming in

197
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Tutela

198
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
Nibiru is coming back

199
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
Nibiru wormwood all these names referred zecharia sitchin called

200
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
The 12th Planet

201
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Explain it to

202
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Zecharia sitchin wrote that book it was the 12th

203
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,159
Planet because he had also

204
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
Just added an extra couple if you don't know what team

205
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
Kitchen believes that there was another planet Nibiru

206
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Time

207
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
Cricket

208
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,087
The moon as I understand the asteroid

209
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
Mostly from Miss translating and

210
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Just making stuff

211
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Trickshot

212
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Yeah

213
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Long way to go

214
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Who created over billions of years from space

215
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
Also

216
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Be the home of the

217
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
The fabled Anunnaki

218
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
The Ancient Aliens

219
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,583
Okay

220
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
But there's so much to do

221
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,031
The idea that Planet X was coming back into orbit near Earth was one of

222
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
The primary preoccupation

223
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
The people who said that the world is going to end

224
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
December 21st 2012

225
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
As they related

226
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
The elongated

227
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
Baktun Long Count cycle

228
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Calendar

229
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,391
To the very long orbit the de imagen de Peru would have to have

230
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
To escape notice

231
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,279
For all of these astronomers have been able to witness

232
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Okay

233
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
So you could say that

234
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Most people thought that

235
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Nibiru

236
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Was going to come

237
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm through December 12th

238
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
20

239
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
21st 2012

240
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
It's hard because of the

241
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
I'm sorry

242
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,063
We Are The Sugarhill Gang no need to show off your skills

243
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,207
Diculous

244
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
In order for it to

245
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Of people's ability to

246
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
So they come up with ideas but it

247
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Goodyear

248
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
The orbit

249
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Supposed to

250
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Why not it's not

251
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
That's the part that NASA does it make

252
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Possibly true

253
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
Is it there's a theoretical possibility that there's a bunch

254
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Like a large planet

255
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,479
That is outside of our ability to observe it

256
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
They don't know that it exists

257
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
They don't say it does

258
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
But there are wobbles in orbit that would be explained by a giant

259
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,839
A giant a giant planet like

260
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
The out there

261
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,471
Create that slight wobble

262
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
Probably isn't

263
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Necessarily true

264
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,919
And also based on how far I would have to be out it would have been thrown out

265
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Of the orbit

266
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
So if there were something

267
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Close to what

268
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
People who believe in

269
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
That's probably impossible

270
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
But

271
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
Believe in

272
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
The Planet X

273
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
They suggest

274
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Set the calendar that the Mayans

275
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
It was actually

276
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
Itself used to track the time

277
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
We're here

278
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
From Planet X

279
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
So the Anunnaki made the mind

280
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,759
So they were running out hours

281
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Here's the thing

282
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
The population of the world because they

283
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
Nothing like that

284
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Destroyed

285
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,959
Somehow this makeup and

286
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Fix the

287
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
So run out of conductors

288
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
There was a bit of a miscommunication between the print Princesa and

289
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,271
Belittling of the Anunnaki people

290
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
For the last time

291
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,375
Well if you're talking to

292
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
It brings in all of his mistranslation to Samaria a little bit of

293
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
The fight I don't remember the rest

294
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Those books

295
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Pappadeaux's bacterol very super

296
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
But the thing is the idea of this planet didn't start

297
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
2012 Syria

298
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
Or 12 or 9

299
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,647
Whatever it was first put out by a woman

300
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
Who believed yourself you been chosen by aliens

301
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,767
From Zeta reticuli who communicate with her through a chip

302
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
Put in her brain

303
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,399
He was chosen as a Paul Revere type toward mankind of the imminent coming of Planet X

304
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:44,799
Sitting back in 1995 at which point she assured everyone that this was going to happen in May 2003

305
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
She was wrong

306
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,199
She claimed that the alien specified that dated a white lie

307
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,295
Meant to guarantee that the establishment on Earth did not interfere with the alien

308
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Very unspecific plan

309
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
So after they destroy the Earth

310
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,047
Her contention was that this information is important for both enemies

311
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
Exactly

312
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,983
You're going to come up with something that's a little bit more interesting than saying like I f***** up a digit somewhere

313
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,151
Now unfortunately a week before the supposed date of the arrival of Planet X

314
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,991
Most popular radio station K-Rock

315
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:31,391
And advised listeners to euthanize their pets so they wouldn't have to suffer when Planet X arrive

316
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
But she may be responsible for more dead dogs than Alex Jones

317
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Because

318
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
K-Rock is a

319
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Huge radio.

320
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
And

321
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
Some people took her at her word

322
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
Hate to do it

323
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,871
Put my dog down

324
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,967
Whatever religion

325
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:03,135
Destroys every $20

326
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
The moment that it was supposed to happen

327
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Hysteria is real

328
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
From that point on the idea of Lakers

329
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Nancy L

330
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Planet X

331
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Zecharia sitchin

332
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Most people don't really even know the difference

333
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
Nancy's all about that

334
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,895
Connection of credibility because most people don't know

335
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Takes a crisis

336
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Turn on the other half

337
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
Who's responsible for somebody dead.

338
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,487
In 2017 a completely insane Christian numerology

339
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
Just named David Mead started propagating

340
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,839
Theory that Nibiru was inbound to go to

341
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
MSY Perth

342
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
In September twenty

343
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,287
He based his theory on misreading scripture tying and tons of unrelated and false conspiracy theories

344
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
A little bit about astronomy

345
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
I'm at date came naturally said he had

346
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
If your numbers wrong

347
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
He's not as creative as Nancy

348
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
2017

349
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
Eclipse the Sun and North Korea China and Russia would launch a nuclear attack on the United States

350
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,351
Earth would be devastated by a series of earthquakes

351
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Lordship by 30°

352
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
United States and Barack Obama would be elected president for an unconstitutional third term

353
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,231
Let him stay in there until we get that s*** worked out

354
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
B12 because you got a you got to remember that that was theirs

355
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Popular fear

356
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
You're back then

357
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
They're always so sad that dumb pets

358
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:02,175
Credible

359
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:09,343
Who is going to make sure barakett the Third

360
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,207
Stick with the red dragon exploding or whatever the f*** you're talking about

361
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
I'm having a difficult time because

362
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Would have already been elected

363
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
I don't understand how he saying that Obama would be Alexa

364
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Good for a third

365
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
I just made

366
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,407
Killed in the

367
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,551
Android

368
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
You're right I apologize I forgot

369
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
Search for 25 years now.

370
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,511
Not so talented planet

371
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,583
A heading for earth that's full of malevolent to alien

372
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
If use that to sell book

373
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
Videos go viral

374
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
Does a real-life Messenger on Earth from another world

375
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Every time

376
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
David wrong

377
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
And shown to be liar

378
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
So

379
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
Is coming on

380
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:10,783
To bring that into the world.

381
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,184
We did this 6 years ago rehashing 2012 stuff that was a big

382
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,256
Embarrassment for my community

383
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
But he's doing the same thing I know it's time for the same

384
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,288
Are we need a remake of Spider-Man one more time ever again Spider-Man

385
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,640
We now

386
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
What are you talkin about that

387
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Yeah that's

388
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
What do you talk

389
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Sing about

390
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
He's literally talk about the same thing

391
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
This is not new

392
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
You know

393
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Anunnaki

394
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
Because of this

395
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
Friends

396
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,824
What we started the ancient Sumerian

397
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Darkstar

398
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
The dark

399
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Prepared

400
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,088
Cannibalistic events

401
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Soon follow

402
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,488
So he's friends with

403
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
Did he say

404
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
Chronicle Expedition got really high with him

405
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
Earth Chronicle

406
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,920
Aromatherapy degree

407
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Fresh lavender

408
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
I would be like yeah I bet you did

409
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
7 friends

410
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:58,560
First of all

411
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,912
He's dead you can do whatever you want

412
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:08,544
It seems like

413
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Who's crazy

414
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
No compunction about life

415
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
So

416
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
Or just believe in bulshit

417
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
You think if he was friends with an alien

418
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,696
Why wasn't

419
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,168
They can't allow him on Ancient Aliens

420
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,752
They would have to have they would have to come down with the concrete

421
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
Because he'll we got one of them

422
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Right

423
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
The season finale though right

424
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
Surprise

425
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
We got

426
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
And then

427
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,400
Really like

428
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
I felt so

429
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
Worried

430
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
That like

431
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
All the episodes

432
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Alien

433
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,128
He was on it I've seen nothing come up

434
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
Because he wasn't talking

435
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
This b******* back on there

436
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Self

437
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
It's a big problem whenever anyone is relying on snitching to make their argument because the

438
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Reasons are to plenty

439
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
I know that I was Joan says that sort of thing like

440
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
I want to prove this to you but I can't cuz I've so much

441
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
But in this case that is

442
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Kind of true

443
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
We're just going to do a great

444
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
I'm not even going to do that but I'ma tell everyone where they can

445
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
Can go

446
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
You should be very skeptical

447
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Because

448
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
Claims to be a linguistic

449
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
$6

450
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:00,160
His work shows that he has absolutely no idea how to translate Sumerian or Aramaic

451
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
How did he claimed

452
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
Upon which this whole argument is based

453
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,304
His translation is what

454
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
He's basing all of this on

455
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Experts

456
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
Who have studied gorgeous day like

457
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
No

458
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
It's not

459
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Vacations

460
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432
He also doesn't know anything about

461
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
Hebrew and in fact

462
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
From his works like

463
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Stairway to Heaven

464
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
To not know the difference

465
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Hebrew and Aramaic

466
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Which is a big problem

467
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
That seems in Port

468
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,232
Just because the latter is look similar than a lot of cases

469
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Does not mean that they're the same language

470
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
He's running the East room

471
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:44,448
The old kind of goes into a small village

472
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,520
And then surprise

473
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,104
The only one who can communicate with this person he might as well be

474
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
Just make stuff up

475
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
The matches predetermined meaning

476
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
As is the case with his translation of nephelym

477
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
The possibly mean quote

478
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
People of the fiery rocket

479
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,928
There's literally nothing in any language that he's coming from

480
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
That is close to

481
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
Mentor people of the fiery rocket

482
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Citron scholarship is

483
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Complete ship

484
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
If you want to learn more about this

485
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Go to

486
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,032
Ww.w

487
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
This is a site run by dr. Michael S Heiser

488
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
With a PhD

489
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
Hebrew and somatic studies and was

490
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,064
Biblical literature Regional

491
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
For the Pacific Northwest

492
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
2007

493
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
Very academic minut details

494
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
Exactly what

495
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Kitchen Miss Translate

496
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
Why it matters

497
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
I would love to get into it like

498
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
The reason that I'm just saying go to that website

499
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
If you want to learn more about all of it is because

500
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
I can't sit here

501
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
And like

502
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
I don't know

503
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
Credibly explain to you why it matters

504
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
If there's a yellow.

505
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
In the middle of the word in

506
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
Kitchen just ignores it

507
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,784
Write in words

508
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Assuming

509
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Come from one root

510
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
When in reality

511
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
Because the morphology of the word

512
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
It's clear it means some

513
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,512
Okay so there's just like there's

514
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
I understand

515
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
When I read it but

516
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Explain it to you

517
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
You can visit my website

518
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,240
Www.is ditching wrong.

519
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
And when you go to that page there's a

520
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,152
Just a big banner that says yes and it's a link to

521
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,456
Also this guy Michael Heiser

522
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Michael Heiser

523
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Has repeatedly

524
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Offered

525
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
Debate

526
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
And he is never X

527
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,744
Even like I used to

528
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
He has on his

529
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
Coast to Coast AM

530
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Multiple

531
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Is offered

532
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
Do you like to debate

533
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
An antigen

534
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Not do it

535
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,800
Which kind of

536
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Could be

537
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
The circuit

538
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Lived in

539
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
You can just make sure it up

540
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,624
You just makes it up that people know about

541
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
But because nobody knows about Sumerian but like five people especially

542
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Awareness

543
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Of the language

544
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,424
And it's really easy to pull a con on because it's

545
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
To most of

546
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
What is taught in history class

547
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Really easy to

548
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
Trick people with

549
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Video

550
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
The veneer of it

551
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Exotic

552
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Yeah

553
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Sumerian

554
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,880
Like stuff I know a little bit enough to be

555
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
Idiot about it I mean

556
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,744
It's just like a unrelated

557
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
Like it's not it doesn't have a an aunt

558
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
Decedent

559
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,800
Forms of language I can't speak to that fall out of credibility

560
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
Disabled

561
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
You know what I have a theory that I'm working

562
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,528
I think it has a pretty solid grounding in reality

563
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,160
I think that Eddie page just read zecharia sitchin book

564
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
He's kind of repeat

565
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Feeding them

566
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,024
I think that might be a whole lot

567
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Of his sort of

568
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Worldview

569
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
Yeah maybe a lot of it is

570
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Just here

571
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
He's just

572
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Reciting

573
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
And stuff from searching

574
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
When we understand who the Fallen one

575
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
The Watcher angels

576
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
They were warriors

577
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
And they were giants

578
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
So now

579
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,168
Piper Warrior

580
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
We're here to protect

581
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,568
The first creation the Atom Man

582
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
Is mentioned in the Book of Enoch the Watchers

583
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,512
And you know again you haven't you have a garden here

584
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
Separate the flowers from the weed

585
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
Specifically

586
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
Translation

587
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Got that idea of the Watchers

588
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,896
Is the Nephilim being the Fallen one

589
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Stuff like that

590
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Heiser's

591
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
One of these

592
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Going to the explanation

593
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
That he provides

594
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
Is about the idea of

595
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
Nephilim

596
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Fallen

597
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
1

598
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
And that is a mist

599
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,328
That's describing the root word being the verb

600
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
The fall

601
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Approved

602
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Very very

603
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
Easy-to-follow explanation

604
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Open explanation is

605
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
You can have with ebru

606
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
If you don't speak

607
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
A very thorough explanation

608
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Otherwise I can't

609
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Abita root word

610
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
Cancellation

611
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Leads me to believe

612
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
But he is just red

613
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Zecharia sitchin

614
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
Kim's work

615
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,192
It doesn't even look like it's more like they were the Three Stooges

616
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
They were the fallen ones they were the ones

617
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
To fall regularly and

618
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah

619
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
Three Stooges

620
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
Harbingers of chocolate

621
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,552
They were giants

622
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,856
Metaphorical but they were giants

623
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Industry

624
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
TV

625
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
The Vaudeville

626
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,864
So I don't believe a lot but that already

627
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Southbay pulling up

628
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,240
Nephilim the barouche it

629
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
He's a no

630
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
This guy's got some

631
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
F****** academic

632
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
Background

633
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,688
You don't know that about it

634
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Yeah man

635
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:23,296
What with a voice like that

636
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,464
Master's degree and Jill set

637
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,792
Very proud of my education

638
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
Money goodbye

639
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
Thankfully the government pay for that education

640
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:49,152
Anyone feel but I do know what's going on

641
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
So

642
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,576
Geophysics

643
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
Buford

644
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Y'all make your own conclusion

645
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,280
So now this is where it becomes difficult is the fact is that his birth name is Tommy Coleman Jr

646
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,144
Going by Eddie page when you talk about all this alien stuff

647
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,288
Facebook

648
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,712
Zoeva 3rd Michael Wolff Michael Wolff

649
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:29,600
Do you write that book Wolfe

650
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
Not with you at

651
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:37,792
Alright

652
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:45,216
So now we have Tommy call him Junior Michael Wolff

653
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,312
Form of his actual name

654
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:55,712
I don't f****** know I can't

655
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
None of this makes sense

656
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
But who cares

657
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Probably not

658
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,416
Because of the like murkiness of the

659
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,864
Guaranteed you're going to spend a week your f****** life trying to get to the bottom of it and maybe you won't

660
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Why I'm going to go

661
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
You can skip all that

662
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,032
Because he just said the government paid for his education

663
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,592
Along with his brothers and sisters

664
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,992
Would kind of implies to me that what he is

665
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
Over and over and protecting him all the time

666
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
They then paid for his education

667
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,904
I don't believe that you're getting the Palladium scholarship

668
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
No true true

669
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:44,096
But he would say is that he was in Vietnam

670
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
Days or whatever but it's

671
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,776
Didn't pass in real time when he was shot or whatever and then the aliens put them back together and then

672
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,872
We came back and he was in the CIA or whatever

673
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,224
So that would have been the time when he was getting his master's degrees like when he's

674
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Although he said he was like

675
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Overseas

676
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Whatever for

677
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:10,720
The timeline doesn't work out at all and it's going to get even worse as we go through this episode

678
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
Literally impossible

679
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
To be true

680
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
I don't know

681
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,008
ATMs to go to college

682
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
If it were a part of

683
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
GI Bill

684
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
I don't think the GI Bill covers

685
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm not entirely sure

686
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,040
I didn't look into that

687
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
I can't say but he's argument

688
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Alien

689
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
The government then

690
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Pay for him

691
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
His buddies to go to college

692
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
That

693
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,168
Just to see if they could do it you got to do what you got to do experiments on them

694
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,728
So let's do our first experiment

695
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Can you guys

696
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
Ticketmaster

697
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,664
I want a couple more clips

698
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
Is there before we do

699
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
Blown wide open

700
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
First

701
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Here's some good news

702
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
Tiamat got hit by nav

703
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
America

704
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
The Earth

705
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Not going to

706
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,544
You search music at their your conspiracy

707
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
Shield around it

708
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,416
It will pass within

709
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
When I say

710
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Asteroid

711
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,984
Minority

712
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
We're in person

713
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Dark Day

714
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
I'm just trying to read through his subjects

715
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:15,136
A lot of is worldview

716
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
Especially when he starts talking about the dracos

717
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Dangerous

718
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Expression of his

719
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
Yeah that sounds right

720
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Isaac

721
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,144
Drake

722
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
Going to get that done

723
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Closer to

724
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
Massive planet

725
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
2 million miles

726
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
Wouldn't it

727
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
Just by being

728
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
Like I'm pretty sure that that is

729
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:54,048
Really f****** close as far as Giant

730
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
How far away is the Moon

731
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
You know what else dude also fuckis up

732
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Way before it was

733
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,008
All sorts of effects happening

734
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,432
Comical about the people who are like if you looks

735
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
Like pretty much right at the Sun

736
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,624
Right off to the side of it that's In The Boro

737
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
The fuk up

738
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:26,048
You could get a pill

739
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
It's coming it

740
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,544
It's from that direction and that's why telescopes camp

741
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,104
Coming from behind the Sun

742
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
Right

743
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,752
Because her access is even tilted

744
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,848
No it can't just hide

745
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,456
But that was one of the arguments of why I like that's what a lot of people

746
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,528
You know how bad the arguments

747
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
Level of thinking but

748
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,512
The only reason I bring that up is because

749
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Advocate

750
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
That f****** planet

751
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,192
It's going to be affecting us in a very serious way

752
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,664
I'm not sure how big it is

753
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,736
Bigger than Jupiter

754
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
Like I don't think

755
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
Carbon-based

756
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
Planets

757
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
You're f****** really don't think you're out

758
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,656
Your daps

759
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
As a master's degree in jio

760
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
It doesn't make any

761
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,576
Of course I really don't think

762
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
Has superpowers

763
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:33,280
He basically said it was supposed to be seen in 2017

764
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,120
You could say there been some sightings of it

765
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,008
And I'm also wondering if it has the ability to do what I call interdimensional

766
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
Like any

767
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,128
Probably music

768
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
A rapid speed

769
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,248
Because I believe it can appear and reappear

770
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,552
Depending on where you

771
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,880
It is

772
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
What what do you think

773
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
Very credible

774
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,008
You're watching this my hat's off to you brother I'm praying for you

775
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,176
He's known me for a long time and I just wish I could talk with him or

776
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,552
What is happening right now

777
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
Hyperdimensional

778
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
It is also a

779
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,560
It is under intelligent control

780
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Okay

781
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:45,728
Dealing with a planet that can create

782
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,056
Rosen Bridge reality whatever it likes

783
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:59,039
Intelligent

784
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:05,951
Traversing the universe

785
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:11,071
It was simultaneously here and not here always

786
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
Look this is.

787
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
This is

788
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Ridiculously

789
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
What do you even do with it

790
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,639
It's a f****** big that star out there real hard-hitting research

791
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
You got it

792
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,247
We need to interview

793
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Stitching is wrong

794
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,063
Right

795
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,111
Otherwise how will we ever know

796
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
New school reading sites

797
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
Plenty of examples of

798
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,495
Into the idea that it is a hyperdimensional

799
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
Planetary size

800
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Spaceship

801
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
Ludacris

802
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,479
I think that's all we need to say about that because I want

803
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
To get to this

804
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Is where the timeline

805
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
I can't even

806
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:14,047
Okay

807
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
Labor working Theory

808
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
First

809
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
You just read zecharia sitchin stuff and he

810
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
He's co-opting it

811
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,567
Fit

812
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
Is Kerry Cassidy

813
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Larry nickel

814
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:41,695
Almost certainly wasn't associated with polarity

815
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,703
So are you ready page

816
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,335
Are you ready for the timeline

817
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Busted

818
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:06,015
And I don't know I mean I know you've been tested I when you work for the military cetera as a psychic

819
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,647
And I know you would do that

820
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:16,767
Is there anything else in the public domain if you can talk about where you can improve

821
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,559
That what you said was

822
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,095
What's true in that case

823
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,935
Came out later in other words have you done any other predictions that

824
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
People might recognize

825
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,663
I don't have all the documents here in front of me and

826
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:41,087
Talk about it that you can send documents to me later and I can post

827
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
And I will talk about it

828
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,839
United States President Ronald Reagan

829
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
Great Britain

830
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Eddie was at

831
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
David and 86

832
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Yep

833
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,831
Alright

834
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,135
No no.

835
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,951
Don't worry about that for now

836
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
Why didn't you bring this up

837
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
Well he was but he was the one I would assume

838
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
I would like to ask him about that

839
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,215
I mean like this

840
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:34,335
Your first time on the f****** show I would assume he be like

841
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:39,711
Give you a lot of credibility brought up in

842
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,343
It's such nonsense but

843
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,999
You talk about a lot of great friends to call Bart Ronald Reagan

844
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Great friend

845
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,447
I'm the guitar up and having they like any we could use you on base

846
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
I'll be up there later boys

847
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:08,127
Actually was friends with all of this

848
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Dead Prez

849
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:15,551
Not friends with any of the living presidents

850
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
Is George h.w.

851
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
Now hear me out on this

852
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
Cuz I was friends with him

853
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,559
He sort of calls out h.w. bush

854
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,399
More concerned about

855
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,895
Assassination attempt

856
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:46,271
Play mr. president

857
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,023
Especially

858
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Yep

859
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
Sounds right

860
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
In what

861
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:16,479
Looking for my brother

862
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
You talking about the Bible guys

863
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,879
Is funny is I received from President Reagan and George Bush

864
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,247
Why aren't you talk about this with the president

865
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,599
Ronald Reagan would look me Square in the eye and he says what is

866
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,327
We will see the rising temperature will see strange weather pattern

867
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,679
The big dragon

868
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
Is sitting

869
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,007
In our living room

870
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
And we will see multiple multiple

871
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
Destructive

872
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,503
Before this planet arrive

873
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,439
The Earth's center will

874
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,327
Eric Bullock

875
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,239
This is my favorite and perhaps most creative way to be a climber

876
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
Pretty impressive

877
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
If Yellowstone

878
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,831
No no no planet is making a burger coming

879
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Inside

880
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,975
So George h.w. Bush

881
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
Did not enjoy the present

882
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,447
He was trying to help Ronald Reagan figure out

883
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
What you was going

884
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,519
To do about this

885
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,847
I have a lot more respect for HW now that I know that

886
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Stair 48 hours straight

887
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,223
That's in any kind of no contest

888
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,391
That was a 2-minute long clip where you explain the interaction

889
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,671
With Reagan and Bush

890
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,487
Raise already said that he's good friends

891
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
One play this one more time another clip work

892
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,583
Reconfirm

893
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
But he talked about aliens with

894
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
You're talking about

895
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:50,335
How you were you're dealing with Reagan so you're saying that you were talking about this back in the days when Reagan was

896
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
Absolutely

897
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
Absolutely

898
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Now

899
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,503
Here's where that is problematic for

900
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,111
That sounds like a Robert Evans

901
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
About aliens

902
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Was Ronald Reagan

903
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
George h.w.

904
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,631
And this is after he showed us

905
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
The video of him

906
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
Bob Chapman was there

907
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,871
Advise President Reagan Vice President Bush in 1986

908
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
The Draco aliens

909
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
Nibiru

910
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
Is a slight problem

911
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:35,135
Because you didn't know anything about

912
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,951
On February 10th 1991

913
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,023
No no no

914
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:44,863
He didn't know anything about being a Pleiades

915
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Nope

916
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,727
It doesn't work it just doesn't work

917
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
It doesn't work

918
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,359
Absolutely doesn't work there's no way for this all to I mean

919
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
You know with me would be like

920
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,967
Fractured logic of people

921
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Spinning yarn

922
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,319
Obviously it would be something along

923
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,671
Story workout right right

924
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
I remote

925
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,255
View into the past of my own brain

926
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,071
The stops that his narrative comes from

927
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,095
Happened because

928
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Regression

929
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
Videotape

930
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
These these exist

931
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Of him

932
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
Coming to his

933
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,103
His awareness

934
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,735
Inter 1991 repressed his memories

935
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:39,135
Advising Reagan about

936
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,511
He knows about aliens

937
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303
That should be like

938
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,863
Lake Michigan Beach any shocking to him

939
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
To learn all this stuff

940
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
It's nonsense when you be shocked

941
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,639
You just found out that years ago you would hung out with the president

942
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:05,503
Shocking if you found out that

943
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
Pictures of badass

944
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:16,255
Yeah kind of pretty as that O'Shucks any kind of avoid

945
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,631
Carrie is Charmed by this somehow I don't understand it

946
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,703
At all

947
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
Like that

948
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
But that like those

949
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,591
On par with the documents

950
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,127
He flashes up on camera

951
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,175
Weather

952
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
Fuchsia

953
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,247
Later this episode

954
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,575
Question from the chat room that is accusing of being a temp

955
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,647
He pulls out from

956
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
I don't know some f******

957
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:59,263
It's like it's literally like if he was

958
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:06,431
Being on a Wheaties box

959
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,831
This is a this is a picture of today's newspaper in 1986

960
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,439
There is no

961
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
The Templars the Tif

962
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,231
It looks like just something

963
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
Turn it off and look at it like a

964
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,351
Like a bad printer

965
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,447
Frames do and then he always

966
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
Flash up on screen to stuff

967
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Just like fire

968
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,567
Horlick even on the other episode

969
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,639
She was talking to him about all the metals you received from the Army

970
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:43,039
Like all of us

971
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
Titles

972
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
Represent the real metal

973
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Sure guy

974
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,231
Call Eddie

975
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:56,863
Do better the only thing that I would accept as if somebody called him a cowboy

976
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,679
You're goddamn right

977
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,751
Surprised at this point to learn that not only

978
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,543
Is Eddie into a lot of horseshit

979
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
He's also into

980
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Ostradamus

981
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,151
What

982
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,735
Sumerian

983
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:19,647
Oh yeah real quick because you was taught by zecharia sitchin which I would say even if that's true

984
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,207
That means you don't know how to repost

985
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,559
This was mine

986
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,423
Historical

987
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,031
With a master's in journalism

988
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,103
I did my job good thoroughly well

989
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:44,479
Understanding the theology

990
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,879
History

991
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:05,215
I forgot that Nostradamus his name was Mikhail G Nostradamus I thought it was just a guy named Michael

992
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,799
Nostradamus

993
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,847
I'll recite it to learn about

994
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,895
Man

995
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
You know what

996
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
WhatsApp

997
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
His other name

998
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
Notarized

999
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Can't do it

1000
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
Can come up with

1001
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,327
Fear of a

1002
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
But not everywhere

1003
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
She's going to go somewhere

1004
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,823
It takes a nation of millions to hold us back

1005
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,663
I don't think I've done perfect job of selling us out just yet

1006
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:49,247
I made the claim that I believe that on this episode we

1007
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,783
Receive much more of a

1008
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
Link

1009
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,367
Between the worlds Project Camelot and Alex Jones

1010
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,695
They should make clear why this is still a relative

1011
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
Use of our sphere even though it's

1012
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:00,767
Ludacris

1013
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
Wacky dude

1014
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,863
Lying about space

1015
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,775
In their cunning form

1016
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,055
They will return

1017
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,943
I do believe that will be the return

1018
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,135
Okay

1019
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,815
2020

1020
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:42,239
I don't know nothing

1021
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,127
Should I carry

1022
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,759
Very good

1023
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,319
Mister

1024
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Brock

1025
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
Loan

1026
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
Fisher

1027
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,487
Is there a Brock Lesnar

1028
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:07,839
Okay Mr Brock if you're watching answer you got some of your flunkies watching

1029
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:15,263
Anticipating your reply

1030
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,615
Putting on the spot

1031
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,407
I wouldn't hold your breath

1032
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
I won't either

1033
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,991
I don't believe

1034
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:31,391
Brock long has years from now

1035
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,671
Making stuff up

1036
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,791
I know Maria I got a flood of that up pretty hard

1037
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
But

1038
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
Want to tell me something about

1039
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
Future

1040
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,519
Is going to happen

1041
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,639
Break because FEMA director has told

1042
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Yeah

1043
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,943
So

1044
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
That's stupid

1045
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,759
Is he even going to be the FEMA director

1046
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
Orbitz

1047
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,087
To go conspiracy

1048
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Yeah if you know what's going

1049
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391
Be happening

1050
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,719
December 20th 2020

1051
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,255
Getting ready for the election

1052
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:14,399
Finally when we were going to redo 90210 September 20th

1053
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
20

1054
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
Does Trump knows he's going to lose

1055
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
2020

1056
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,639
They're going to fake an Uber ride

1057
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:34,111
You know

1058
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,903
How many people work

1059
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,719
Lighter to the ground

1060
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,303
How many people do

1061
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
Look

1062
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
It doesn't matter cuz I one person

1063
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,911
Works there Brock long

1064
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,471
Don't believe

1065
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
Whatever

1066
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,543
This is just more s*** that like

1067
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,431
Verify his school history

1068
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
It doesn't say where you went to school

1069
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:04,063
The same thing here it's just okay Brock long told me this s***

1070
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
Google who's the head of FEMA

1071
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,671
Play me talk to you he's never going to address it

1072
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
This guy's lying

1073
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Things to worry about

1074
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
Also I think

1075
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,839
Said something along the lines of

1076
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,167
Broccoli

1077
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,727
Put on the Cowboys

1078
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,519
Metaphorically put on the cowboy hat

1079
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,847
I said that this is very similar to

1080
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
Alex's work because

1081
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
And now in this next clip

1082
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
It becomes far more

1083
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,063
I've been told by whistleblowers that there is a

1084
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,879
Storage shelf life.

1085
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,695
Things that need repair on the planet

1086
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:46,047
Likey no railroads and infrastructure

1087
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
Airport

1088
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:55,007
And that there is a great deal of things right now that are in need of repair that they're not bothering

1089
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:02,943
And that they're also trying to move populations as she says there's evidence growing evidence and I'ma

1090
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
This as well

1091
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,063
Through my own intuition I dreams

1092
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,159
So on of a movement that people away from the coast

1093
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,231
And also to get them away from

1094
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,023
Being out in the

1095
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,071
Outlying areas so they won't

1096
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,399
Have lands they won't be able to have their own well

1097
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:27,263
They won't have their own water they'll have to allpak into FEMA camps and all this time thing

1098
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,871
So that when anything's strikes regardless of what it is people will be

1099
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,223
Vulnerable

1100
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,247
Before you

1101
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:44,159
False Flags

1102
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,839
Entirely

1103
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,399
Exactly the same as what

1104
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,191
You into FEMA camps

1105
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
In order to take away your autonomy

1106
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,591
You're not fixing the roads and f******

1107
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
What are we doing

1108
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,791
It's not it's not like there aren't people who are pushing

1109
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Ford

1110
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,239
It is because people allocate money in the wrong place

1111
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,799
Any generally allocated towards

1112
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,943
Rich people

1113
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,479
In the same way that like

1114
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:45,855
Eddy's using like this idea that Nibiru is coming

1115
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,903
Explain away the effects of climate change

1116
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
Carrie is using this

1117
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
Conspiracy of trying to

1118
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
The Forsyth

1119
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:56,095
Explain why Rich oligarchs don't want to pay for public goods

1120
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,399
Republic

1121
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
Why are libraries

1122
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,751
Deteriorating and no one cares about them

1123
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Probably if

1124
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,591
I do not like

1125
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,639
It's like all of these people

1126
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,223
Smart enough to know

1127
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
What problems

1128
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:24,255
The problems are supposed to like your your right-wing where they're just like climate change has even happened shut up

1129
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:33,215
Oligarchs are destroying our

1130
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,311
I'm still racist so I can't be on the liberal side

1131
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,359
So maybe it's just a lie

1132
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,455
People who are all of them

1133
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,903
Deal with the solution because it's associated with the people that they don't like

1134
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,951
Definitely not racist reason

1135
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
So if you recognize the problem

1136
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,095
Then make up a different problem and call that when the solution

1137
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
Climate change

1138
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
You know there are problems

1139
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
You're talking about

1140
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
Did they have

1141
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,271
Answer

1142
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
The problem

1143
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,367
Jiggle around with the answer

1144
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,927
Is because they're trying to sell something

1145
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,743
Denial

1146
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
Whole cloth

1147
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,815
The reality that people see in front of them

1148
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,863
They have to just come up with a different

1149
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
Explanation that serves there

1150
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
Weird

1151
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,215
Yeah cuz cuz

1152
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,519
Rich people

1153
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
31

1154
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,359
You can't pull the same like just deny it

1155
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:47,199
Right right operating the margins like a Little Lamb

1156
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,783
Basically

1157
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,367
Here's another clip

1158
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,439
Pretty Infowars adjacent

1159
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,023
Now I would I would like to do however is

1160
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
Talk about

1161
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,375
What you think is the motivation

1162
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,423
For keeping the

1163
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,543
The return of Planet X Nibiru wormwood whatever they want to call it

1164
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,847
From the people in other words

1165
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:20,223
Are you of the opinion that they are going to basically try to

1166
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:27,647
Put people in FEMA camps that you've seen maybe the coffins and things they've showed

1167
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,695
Is this is this your understanding

1168
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,303
I will tell you this

1169
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:39,679
Again

1170
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,007
Nothing hidden by any

1171
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Government

1172
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Good luck

1173
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:08,351
Organ harvesting

1174
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,935
Get rid of the dead body

1175
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,727
Easier ways to get organs outside

1176
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
Are they cut

1177
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,151
Are they cut your head off and then get

1178
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:27,551
The Morgans are they like

1179
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:32,415
Jordans out to preserve the organs

1180
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:39,583
Look at the dump what's a great explanation for why the government would be hiding

1181
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,911
Cuz we're not worried about

1182
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,055
I would probably a reason

1183
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871
Brielle why they would talk about it

1184
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,455
Directions 84th Street

1185
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
Specifically

1186
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,319
Created by right-wingers in order to try and lock up

1187
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
Sprite with an ox

1188
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,647
Something

1189
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
Continue playing

1190
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
It was not something

1191
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Has

1192
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,255
Talk about all the FEMA

1193
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
Camp s*** in relation to Alex

1194
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Sawbuck

1195
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
Is really disgraceful

1196
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
People's arguments

1197
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
There are

1198
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
Preparation

1199
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,799
The Federal Emergency Management

1200
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Is making

1201
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,847
Shoot

1202
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,127
Catastrophic

1203
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
If they didn't

1204
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
80-page

1205
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
Alex Jones Kerry Cassidy

1206
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:33,087
Will be the first people standing up and being like

1207
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
Government

1208
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,207
They would be the people who were victimized

1209
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,511
Preparation

1210
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,375
They're not coming from an honest

1211
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Place

1212
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,703
If they were they would actually look at the reality

1213
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,983
Of these programs

1214
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
And what is

1215
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,311
Made up and what is real and they like

1216
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
For Global

1217
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:01,759
Fetty WAP

1218
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,319
Who would be angry like at anybody

1219
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,855
Preparing for anything they're like

1220
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,647
Oh you're preparing for us

1221
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
Do you know what that mean

1222
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,327
You don't know what's going to happen

1223
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:20,191
You can't see into the future so you're going to make it

1224
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
The magical thinking of people who believe that

1225
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
Planet-sized

1226
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
Spaceship out there that

1227
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,103
Enphase in and out of existence

1228
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Oregon

1229
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,991
I don't have a club

1230
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,551
Eddie

1231
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,855
But

1232
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:42,207
God is an idea created by

1233
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,935
Project Camelot

1234
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
Auto

1235
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,503
Carrie and all of them believe in angels

1236
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,295
It like that no doubt

1237
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
Damn

1238
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,839
Geophysics

1239
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,143
Yeezys all kinds

1240
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,959
Title would not become have

1241
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
Is a word

1242
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,079
He has an exit strategy

1243
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,663
There is ships out there waiting too well

1244
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
Not the rapture

1245
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,247
It is an extraction

1246
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,039
Because the final battle

1247
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:42,367
Right here on terra firma

1248
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
All right so what

1249
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:52,095
Interesting that you're being so specific about it and I do appreciate that so people

1250
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,935
Will certainly

1251
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,727
Vibrant

1252
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:02,591
I appreciate it

1253
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
I like

1254
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
I like what she

1255
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
She just did

1256
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
Some Judo right

1257
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,063
How do you mean I mean when she said like

1258
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:19,487
I'm glad you're being so specific you're being so specific about it which I appreciate

1259
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
He was really saying like

1260
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
Don't be specific about it you're saying this dumb s*** on my shows as disprovable I don't I don't want

1261
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,055
This to be I don't want to look like an idiot for having you on don't state-specific s*** this is

1262
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,735
Do you want to continue to be a guest for those years leading up

1263
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:44,063
To the date of your prediction

1264
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,135
Eventually want to write a book I'll help you sell

1265
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,927
You better not

1266
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,231
Can say something

1267
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
So

1268
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,047
You know

1269
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
I think he's full of s***

1270
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
But

1271
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
Man we've got this

1272
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
Everything is leading towards

1273
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
FEMA camps

1274
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,055
Similarity with the world

1275
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,615
And do we get another one

1276
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Huge but

1277
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
I mean there's overlap

1278
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,575
Underneath the Vatican City

1279
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:20,927
That he's referring to another guest of Project Camelot that he is not a fan

1280
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,487
Believe misled Carey

1281
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
Who cares

1282
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,071
You're talkin about a layer

1283
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,119
Draconian in influence

1284
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Ask yourself this

1285
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:34,751
Why did the St Peter's Basilica have a throne

1286
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,311
The Throne of Lucifer

1287
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:45,503
Admiring

1288
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,319
Talking about what

1289
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:52,415
And I can tell you that actually ledwith

1290
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:02,399
I asked him about that

1291
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,215
So are at least acknowledge

1292
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:09,311
We have a whistleblower called Leo zagami

1293
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,063
Did I try to take him over

1294
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:25,183
The last-minute whatnot

1295
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:31,839
Anyway he did a famous interview with us many years ago in which he a great deal

1296
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
To his credit

1297
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
About what was under the Vatican

1298
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,191
And the black cloak

1299
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
And a lot of other things going on there

1300
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:44,639
Live.me is a pretty regular guest on Alex Jones another Infowars program talks about

1301
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,431
Insider stuff about the vodka

1302
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:52,575
Wendy's on Alex Jones Show with mind-controlled

1303
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:59,231
Parking lot

1304
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,071
You gotta know you're already

1305
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,143
Depending on who you're trying to

1306
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,679
Convince

1307
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,447
Drive-thru

1308
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:21,247
Control mix

1309
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
Very strong antihero

1310
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
So I mean what are you going to do

1311
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
Another overlap though

1312
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,415
Someone who's a guest

1313
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,487
On both of their programs and for some reason

1314
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,535
Noah's Leo zagami

1315
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:40,191
He knows everybody in this every single name that anybody out there

1316
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,263
Ronald Reagan

1317
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
Bush

1318
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
Close friends

1319
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,103
Absolute

1320
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,431
I wish I talked about Liam or Leo

1321
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,967
So there's a drink

1322
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
I thought it was

1323
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Just whipped cream

1324
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
Nope

1325
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Wish

1326
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,135
It was whispering

1327
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,951
Unfortunately

1328
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,023
It is not worth creating all right

1329
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:08,095
B well that's what how do we get rid of them

1330
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
For a lot of whipped cream

1331
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Now

1332
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,775
Visionworks

1333
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
What's that

1334
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,895
Chicken

1335
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,175
Worst news

1336
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,711
There's more Draco basis

1337
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,807
John Kerry

1338
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,855
Do you know him

1339
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
A base there

1340
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,183
Otterbase down there for

1341
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
Long time

1342
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
In Antarctica

1343
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,495
We can go about the the

1344
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,615
The battle that took place in

1345
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,175
He f****** just does every conspiracy

1346
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:02,623
There was a battle between

1347
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,159
I don't want to get into this

1348
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,719
Like if this is all based on

1349
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
Sadly mental

1350
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,071
Who ended up committing suicide

1351
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,887
Who created this elaborate hoax

1352
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,191
About being at the door

1353
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
Sea Battle

1354
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
Yeah

1355
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
Because I'm over Bama's

1356
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,335
The fuckout

1357
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:26,431
But there is an episode that me and Marty DeRosa did about the Dulce

1358
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:31,807
Episode where I got into where all of that comes from and all that

1359
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,415
Also another similarity

1360
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,975
Carrie went down to Aunt

1361
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
For some sort of Nefarious reason

1362
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,863
Dr. hamamoto and Owen Shroyer

1363
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,399
Suggested it's for weather weapon

1364
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:53,567
Certainly not mutually exclusive

1365
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
Why wouldn't you

1366
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
Nose

1367
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,431
Just lunch

1368
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,295
You know

1369
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,855
He's running down the gamut of all

1370
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,647
Hitting all this

1371
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
On the

1372
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
SeaWorld

1373
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,119
I apologize

1374
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:24,287
Gobekli Tepe absolutely

1375
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:31,711
Is there when it was first activated by the archaeologist

1376
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,271
Free skeletons there

1377
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,599
Uber 18 ft tall

1378
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
This is a hoax

1379
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,999
Won't you

1380
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:50,399
Yes I know quite a bit about Gobekli Tepe

1381
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:56,799
It's one of the things that I know that this is a place

1382
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,871
Sacrifice

1383
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:06,271
Supposedly also genetically engineering humans

1384
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:14,463
And I'm not surprised that is that what you're saying because there are

1385
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,815
And he work with them

1386
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:24,447
Another guy Jim and I forgot his last name

1387
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,775
They've been touring of the the world

1388
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,615
Documenting the spines of giant skeleton

1389
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,407
Over the world

1390
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
And they found

1391
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,479
Unbelievable numbers

1392
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,183
Specifically North America have been a tremendous number of giant skeletons

1393
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:51,583
Most have been in Egypt

1394
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:57,983
Giant skeleton

1395
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:03,871
Is that the British Museum of

1396
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:07,711
If surgery or something like that I haven't visited when I was in Britain

1397
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,271
Ashley has a giant skeleton

1398
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
Standing right next to a human

1399
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,391
Real skeleton

1400
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:21,023
It's not caused by some kind of a genetic anomaly

1401
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
Just like you just like me

1402
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:32,287
We've already been over this for like what if it was though

1403
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:39,455
Performer

1404
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
To the point of this is not

1405
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,503
It's some sort of like

1406
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:44,319
Annunaki skeleton

1407
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,671
They know who he is and then

1408
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:52,511
Bones released from The West Wing

1409
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,559
Skeleton

1410
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Also the person

1411
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,215
4th Prospect

1412
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:09,919
Much like in a circus show you would have be very very large guy next to the very very small guy

1413
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,991
Kind of old hats

1414
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,623
Sort of archaeological

1415
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,439
Because it does represent a very early

1416
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
That goes back

1417
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,047
2

1418
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
12000

1419
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
4000

1420
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Years ago

1421
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,959
Somewhere in that range

1422
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:39,359
Skeletons found there is it true that was a hoax

1423
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,663
That he is just repeating as if it were

1424
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,455
Right

1425
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,759
Please happy is really much more interesting

1426
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
Conspiracies

1427
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
Would lead you to

1428
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,391
Uno

1429
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,183
Now they found last year

1430
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,975
Occasions that it is

1431
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
Possibly one of the first

1432
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,815
Sculpt

1433
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,863
In history

1434
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
Yeah yeah yeah

1435
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,679
So

1436
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Newsweek

1437
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,751
Gobekli Tepe

1438
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,543
Extremely important archaeological site

1439
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,079
First discovered in the 1960

1440
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Prices of

1441
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,639
Stone slabs

1442
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
A little like you

1443
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,967
UK is Stonehenge

1444
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:16,991
Far older

1445
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
The site is thought to have been used

1446
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,319
First four ritual a religion

1447
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
Purposes rather than domestic

1448
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,159
Meaning it's widely considered the world's first

1449
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,071
Explain skulls for

1450
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,887
Neolithic.

1451
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,423
Discount Tobacco

1452
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,471
Represent the earliest evidence

1453
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
This potentially means that it's

1454
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,055
It's the first Neolithic skull

1455
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,335
Civilization

1456
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,615
Insecurities. Ritual mod

1457
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,895
Applications to skulls

1458
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,967
So they got baby found

1459
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,551
Discovered

1460
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,575
Southeastern

1461
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,391
Versace

1462
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,159
Drilled into

1463
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,975
The Deep incision have been made along the way

1464
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,999
Black Cadillacs

1465
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,047
Running vertically from the forehead

1466
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
To the back of the skull

1467
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:06,143
One of those also had a hole drilled into it from the top left

1468
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Cranium

1469
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
Which they

1470
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,983
Determined to have been done

1471
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,263
Death is assertive

1472
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,824
Ritual thing done with gold

1473
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,152
Those are weird

1474
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Cremation

1475
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,048
I really I should have noticed this way before now

1476
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,584
All of this sounds like

1477
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,864
They're gossiping

1478
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,680
Everything is like

1479
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:46,336
What did you know that they're there were these Giants

1480
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:51,456
Well did you hear what to do if you know there

1481
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,368
The conversation is

1482
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
In reality

1483
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,440
So

1484
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:05,024
Now we've already I believe done a decent

1485
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,304
Service

1486
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
Connecting this to the world

1487
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,424
Through the FEMA camps.

1488
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,264
There's similar faces like Leo zagami popping up in both places

1489
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
Among other people like Robert David

1490
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
Steelers Ben

1491
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,592
On both

1492
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
David Icke

1493
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,664
But you'd expect

1494
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,736
But now we find a very inter

1495
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,552
Similarity David Icke has rare crossover app

1496
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,344
He does

1497
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
Now

1498
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,904
An interesting crossover

1499
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,464
Narratives that are being sold

1500
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,256
On Project a lot

1501
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,792
And there it is that are being sold

1502
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
Jim Baker's were

1503
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,824
The story of Raven Valley

1504
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:58,272
Why were they living

1505
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,576
Dracko

1506
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,304
There was a blue Kachina star

1507
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,376
Blue Kachina star

1508
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,936
Star

1509
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,496
It brought death and destruction

1510
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,848
Is hiding on the other side of the Sun

1511
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,920
The evidence from Raven Rock

1512
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,224
Intex eco

1513
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,600
Where the Anasazi Indians

1514
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
They were Nazis

1515
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,232
Warlord

1516
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,048
Thirsty

1517
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:57,152
It was people in large saucer ciliary Pratt

1518
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,552
A showed

1519
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,344
People peeing

1520
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:11,744
Is exactly the narratives it was being pitched by that Gaston Jim Bakker Show that we covered Wild

1521
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,536
Exactly the same.

1522
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,560
Also

1523
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
Counterpoint

1524
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Do your

1525
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,168
You shouldn't call them Anasazi because that is

1526
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,008
Is the correct term

1527
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,104
And you know why because Anasazi means ancient

1528
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
Enemies

1529
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,408
So

1530
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:36,832
If you're trying to say that they were there

1531
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:42,464
Hollywood's perceptions of native people

1532
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,792
Is accurate

1533
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Yeah

1534
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:51,424
Website

1535
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,728
But the idea that like everyone lived in

1536
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
Harmony also is

1537
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,544
Equally inaccurate

1538
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,872
Just based on their names you're misusing

1539
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,664
Dump

1540
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,296
No yourselves

1541
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Ancient

1542
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,880
Yeah things to do

1543
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,416
It's almost like

1544
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:18,816
Self-contradictory

1545
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,608
What should we what are we

1546
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:27,264
I hate everybody here where the bad boys

1547
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,312
Continent

1548
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,384
So I got there the sharks

1549
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
Next clip

1550
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Earlier made

1551
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,016
McKay's

1552
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,040
Possibly

1553
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,904
Betty Page

1554
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:48,256
Expressing some of his deep-seated feelings about other races

1555
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,096
Through this Draco

1556
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,144
Free ATM division

1557
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
To the world

1558
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,240
Mike down for this next clip

1559
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,568
Because there's some subtleties things he's saying that I want to make

1560
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
You catch all up

1561
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,152
The ones that are left here

1562
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
Like

1563
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:10,272
The real quick he's talking about when those spaceships that he mention

1564
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,296
Earlier pickup

1565
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,576
The people who are cool

1566
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:15,136
Make sure that they don't get caught

1567
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:15,904
Knee wraps

1568
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,048
They will feel the fire they will feel

1569
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,352
The final solution

1570
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,008
Blackbird

1571
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,568
Our program

1572
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Vinyl

1573
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,408
Greenlight as I like to say

1574
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,016
And I will be

1575
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,832
Total Destruction on

1576
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,416
Including

1577
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
Their main mission

1578
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,280
Draconian

1579
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:56,096
Extermination

1580
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,424
You don't have to call Terminix

1581
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,728
We already had this under control

1582
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,520
So within a minute

1583
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:08,640
He references something called the final solution and talks about Exterminating

1584
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:09,920
Demonic

1585
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,480
That he is at

1586
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:18,112
Its tendrils all over the place they have a base under the Vatican

1587
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,440
That's certainly not something that anti-semites

1588
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,048
Hinted at the idea that the papacy is under the control of

1589
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,584
Nebulous

1590
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Jewish

1591
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,400
Cabal that is taking over

1592
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,704
Now I'm not saying that attracts 100%

1593
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,032
Ideas in the language

1594
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,312
Deeply reminiscent

1595
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,616
Of anti-Semitic canards throughout history

1596
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,968
It's a plausible explanation

1597
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:45,248
Some of it

1598
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
He's putting out there in

1599
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
Uncomfortable about it

1600
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,488
Pass on this language

1601
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
And stuff like that

1602
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
Maybe it's

1603
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,840
Just overly dramatic ways that he's expressing himself

1604
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
But I can't

1605
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,680
Because the last time we looked at him and listen to him

1606
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
He was saying

1607
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:09,056
Hey it sucks but you want to hear the racism's write a bunch of the time

1608
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,176
Deeply racist person that I'm not wrong to feel that way

1609
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,968
You kind of have to hear these words

1610
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:16,992
Through that prism

1611
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,320
And when you have such a poorly defined

1612
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
Groups as

1613
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
Free ATMs

1614
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,160
Draconians

1615
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,696
Kinda have to

1616
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,232
To think that maybe your

1617
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
Saucony

1618
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,304
Might be

1619
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,584
Might be

1620
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:36,704
You think you think that was bad

1621
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,728
This coming

1622
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,264
Great good work dude

1623
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,800
So

1624
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,568
At this point

1625
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,360
Carrie brings up

1626
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,176
Something that I know Mark Richards told her

1627
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,968
And that is that idea that we talked about the

1628
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,248
Satellites up there

1629
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:50,784
That are low top

1630
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:54,880
So actually I

1631
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,256
80 Pages responses to life on her pay

1632
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Dumb

1633
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,656
Not worth listening to that necessarily

1634
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,704
Because what comes after it

1635
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,288
Eddie

1636
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,592
You don't get the Laughing anybody

1637
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,640
You don't get to laugh at anybody

1638
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
This Alters the monster

1639
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,200
The fact that I

1640
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,504
Carrie doesn't bring up

1641
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
It was Mark Richards

1642
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
Forgotten

1643
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,648
The Narrative came from

1644
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
Tertiary

1645
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,208
She cares about

1646
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,536
It's Eddy page

1647
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,304
Alexa

1648
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
Haha I can laugh

1649
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,888
You think it's true

1650
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,704
I've become so insinuated in your world

1651
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,800
Is my 5th time on in like 3 months

1652
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
Brett I am taking over

1653
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
To some extent

1654
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
It gets good

1655
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
The power

1656
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,968
But he has on the show

1657
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,528
Come to this

1658
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,320
A f*****-up

1659
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,392
Realized

1660
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
Outside lights

1661
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,048
Around the globe went down

1662
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:12,960
You know I have been hearing that periodically

1663
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,520
Well

1664
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,896
Real

1665
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,088
Let's see something

1666
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,768
Communications right now for your alphabet agency

1667
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:40,096
And we'll just not take it in America

1668
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,632
Well

1669
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,544
I'll be the first

1670
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:55,200
We shut down several military Hi-Tech communication satellite

1671
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
The Chinese are scratching their head

1672
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
What just happened

1673
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
Vladimir Putin saying

1674
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,672
American

1675
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Summit Facebook

1676
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,360
We could be in a bad mood

1677
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,200
Just taking responsibility for satellites

1678
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:32,064
Absolutely I just saw it in your face

1679
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,088
You noticed

1680
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,136
Quirk of his language

1681
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:38,720
Where he said the Chinese were scratching their heads what happened

1682
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,536
Vladimir Putin said I told you so

1683
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,352
Now that's interesting because he's saying

1684
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,632
Or at least Woody's

1685
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,168
Pretending

1686
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,984
Is that his plea alien Brothers

1687
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,544
Is that the force that he's on the side of

1688
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,104
They were the ones who took down the satellite

1689
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,944
Interesting because just recording

1690
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,784
On September 10th 2018 an article came out in Popular Mechanics

1691
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,112
About how the French were accusing Russia of meddling with their satellite

1692
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:10,464
Quote Frances charge the Russian government with one of the biggest ever cases of

1693
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,488
Space espionage

1694
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,536
France's minister

1695
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
France's minister of event

1696
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
Defense defense

1697
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,144
I complained that a Russian

1698
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,960
Maneuver

1699
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,752
Eavesdropping

1700
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:23,776
Advanced music

1701
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:26,848
Accusations flying

1702
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
Approved

1703
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,456
Anomalous

1704
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
Movement

1705
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Patterns

1706
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,784
Among Russian satellite

1707
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,064
That are

1708
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,088
Indicating there

1709
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,112
Engaging

1710
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,184
That would be one thing

1711
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,208
But also

1712
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,512
There's an article that came out in July on

1713
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:48,096
Electronic warfare

1714
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,168
How to turn off

1715
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,192
Install.

1716
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
School bell

1717
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
Yourself

1718
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,784
Just like Alex

1719
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,832
And the rest of the Patriot world

1720
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:09,600
Eddie

1721
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,368
Lowe's

1722
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,392
Vladimir Putin

1723
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,928
What is wrong with it

1724
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
The type of a team that he

1725
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
Yeah

1726
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
We

1727
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,120
He said

1728
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,680
Roland

1729
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:27,008
From all other reputable media

1730
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
So that's

1731
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,688
Drawing

1732
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,712
Just another concrete

1733
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:37,760
Alex Jones

1734
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:38,784
That's interesting

1735
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344
Opens it up

1736
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,112
2 questions

1737
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:42,880
From the audience

1738
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,440
Elitist

1739
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,464
Interesting thing

1740
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,000
Where are

1741
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,072
Possibly.

1742
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
Here's the first

1743
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
Now

1744
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:58,496
Someone is asking you if you know anything about

1745
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,776
Qanon

1746
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:11,296
Qanon 1989

1747
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,576
Actually it's Reagan

1748
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:16,416
Can fake his death in order to become qanon

1749
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:18,720
That sounds like something they might as well

1750
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,536
The first one

1751
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,816
And then the next one

1752
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,632
That's why it's where we're going to end

1753
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,424
That is scary

1754
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,704
Question

1755
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,240
Alien races

1756
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
She talked about about

1757
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
Completely

1758
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,104
Eversource

1759
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,432
Okay well what about the mantle

1760
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:53,280
Long pause.

1761
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,864
Praying mantis from Gobekli Tepe

1762
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,680
That that week we came across

1763
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:03,776
Time they supposedly

1764
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:07,616
Are trying to cross over to the light side

1765
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,200
That's the latest

1766
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,224
Information we have

1767
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:16,832
Simon parkes is The Whistleblower who talked about that quite a bit

1768
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,112
Cool

1769
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,464
I miss Simon parkes he was really fun I want to threaten facts

1770
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,000
Long pause

1771
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:28,096
You can't make this stuff up

1772
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,632
A regretful

1773
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:36,288
Remember what I've made up in the

1774
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
My mind goes

1775
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:44,224
Can't make this stuff up

1776
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,320
The sequence where he's telling what's going to happen to the people

1777
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,344
People who get taken up in

1778
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,184
Right

1779
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,744
I will teach you new ways of energy

1780
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,024
So all will

1781
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,680
Arianism

1782
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,544
Nevermind

1783
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,128
Cuz the powers-that-be that are in charge are out not let you

1784
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
Adopted

1785
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:16,224
Weather being

1786
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:21,344
Justin Jesse if you can do all that just like do a hard pass on those leaders

1787
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
It's convoluted but it makes sense

1788
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,160
If you already

1789
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,952
Primary primer

1790
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,024
Hot loading on

1791
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,864
Where we going

1792
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
A lot

1793
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
I guess

1794
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,008
It was a barrage

1795
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,616
So it's like a collage

1796
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:50,016
Like it was just put all kinds

1797
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
Things he's cock piecemeal from

1798
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,928
Some conspiracy theories that already exist

1799
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:02,560
What we learned is that Eddie page is absolutely read Zechariah kitchens working is just decided

1800
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:08,704
Sounds good girl talk conspiracy

1801
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,240
He's just mixing and matching

1802
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,776
Just he's just remix

1803
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,824
But buried Within

1804
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Similarities

1805
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
To Alex Jones

1806
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,760
This world should make it much more clear why these worlds are connected

1807
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,552
Though what they choose

1808
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,856
Different

1809
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,648
Hey what they decided

1810
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,928
Is becoming conduct

1811
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,952
Might be a little different

1812
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,000
But their worlds are fun to my

1813
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,072
Jordan

1814
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:35,840
Where website

You can also search

1818
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,496
Knowledge and fight

1819
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,776
You can do that

1820
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,544
Yeah

1821
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:49,152
Whenever she overexplained looking great

1822
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:57,856
Go to ww.w.

1823
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:04,768
Sorry I'm late for the game so quick

1824
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:09,120
And then there's foreknowledge underscore there we are

1825

But also going to Rebrand

1833
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,352
Go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

1834
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,144
Place where good people hang out

1835
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
Absolutely

1836
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Places where you can

1837
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:01,600
Cher

1838
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,136
We're not going to do it ourselves

1839
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,416
You want to stay away from

1840
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,376
Rigidly anyone follow those rules

1841
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,216
Alex Jones at all

1842
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
Episode except for the similarities

1843
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,824
Project Camelot

1844
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,384
Remember that he probably killed to do

1845
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:33,088
Alexandra Thurston color
