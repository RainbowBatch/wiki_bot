In full effect

10
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
And I've been getting

11
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
Some feedback

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,920
Some folks that are concerned that the dreamy creamy summer

13
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
May not be

14
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,064
You know there's people with other diets you know that don't involve

15
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Dairy

16
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,184

It is for everyone

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088

Halo wrapped in a blank

33
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
This is a bad movie

34
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
So I bought a new chair and it's

35
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Gamer chair

36
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696

00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,792

38
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072

I don't know if I am allowed to say who gave it to me

44
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
It was broken

45
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,536
Oh and they said you can have this if you could put it back together

46
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,864
Good luck expensive how did it go

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Put it back together

00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,984
Two pieces in my house for about a year

World's broke

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,344
Watch the splc

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,952
A Bitcoin donation that's a regular thing

61
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,536
Pretty cool. Just because I feel like

62
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
We just said on our episode like

63
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Listen to anybody cared about a b****

64
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,447
Just give $1000000 a true

65
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,591
Million-dollar roof true that is a little bit like that someone cares

66
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,711
Also we had just talked about his money bomb was like um maybe you made a million dollars

67
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Spell paper

68
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
Touche I don't know I don't have a whole lot of insight in that that goes beyond two piece

69
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
I hate watch

70
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
People should check that out it's it's

71
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:52,095
Beat me to the punch of what my kind of main theory was

72
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
Do you like okay if it's something to do with Bitcoin and Alex

73
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Probably Max Keiser involved in his name comes up in the the article

74
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,407
But I do have

75
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
This Disaster is episode

76
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879

77
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Wednesday last week was

78
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463

83
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Quite different

84
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
Maybe the tone of someone who has in the intermediate period of time received a Million Dollar Baby

85
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,735
Got an injection of new life possible maybe we're not all going to die after all turns out

Fluid

105
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,327

00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,823
Destiny

116
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Real monsters like Bill Gates

117
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943

Enslaving

Magnificent species

122
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
I just read you a few headlines here

123
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,471
We are on the precipice of a global food prices Goya Foods CEO warranty

124
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
They can't even get beer

125
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,615
So this was an article about a Fox News Fox Business interview that be Gloria Foods

126
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
CEO Bob unani

127
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,711
I did where he discussed the likelihood of a cup

128
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Food crisis

129
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,551
I was just decided to make up the part about how we can't find

130
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,671
I don't know

131
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
In reality to US Foods dry commodity Trend report from April 29th 2022

132
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Dry edible beans are doing fine

133
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
Do planting progress is slightly behind which is quote

134
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
Normal given cool and wet weather conditions

135
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,055
From the beginning report

136
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:50,943
From the daily Bean there's a reality which is a very likely going to be a food crisis

137
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
He's going to be coming and a pack

138
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,831
A lot of the world and it's like we should take very seriously and we can to help offset

139
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,183
There's also a comical fake version of this that Alex has reported based on his imagination

140
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
Which is only interested in as a vehicle to scare his listeners

141
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
But that's what happens when you start with music like yeah he's coming

142
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,263
I'm just so mad I'm just so mad to go from our last episode 2

143
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
Duel of the Fates in

144
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Our planet

145
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
Imagine my world planet

146
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,919
You wear all day

147
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
Yeah the last episode was we're all dead already goodbye I'm going to be gone in a week

148
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
Do get $1000000 and then we're on a magical planet

149
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:36,255
Globalist

150
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
If you ever needed more evidence

151
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
When he's talking about these

152
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,287
Success or failure of the globalist plant

153
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
A hundred percent

154
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
So we also have a new villain in the mix

155
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:57,759
He's been talked about that Yuval Noah Harari fell of the historian the futuristic

156
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Popular Wicked World economic

157
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,903
Forum Circle sure why not that's one person that Alex has been taken

158
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,255
He's really mad at me

159
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,375
Guru

160
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
We must depopulate the Earth

161
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
We need less Shoals

162
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
The Christian

163
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
One more we want last what

164
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
A satanic

165
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Oh man

166
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,199
That's so sweet so satanic

167
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,759
I just got his name is sadhguru but

168
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
He's not actually a joke

169
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Guru

170
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
Woodside

171
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
If you might describe him as a guru in some settings

172
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
But I don't

173
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:45,375
Think that the world economic Forum has gurus in the way that Alex is describing

174
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Do you mean

175
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
In the wave at

176
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
The Reagan's had an astrologist they don't have gurus

177
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
Not like whole lot whole Yogi

178
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Yogi

179
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
India economic Summit in 2019 sadhguru did a four-minute interview which was

180
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,231
Future needed to involve a restructuring of things like how we produce food and how we dress ourselves

181
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
Agriculture and textiles are two major sources

182
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
The pollution and waste

183
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
In the world

184
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
He also touched on how it was wrong the world has turned things like water and air into Commodities instead of

185
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
Remember the central things that make life

186
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Yeah that's a weird thing for him

187
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,711
In the interview he says that the Earth is not imperil

188
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
It will be just

189
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
That's fine

190
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
If we don't make some changes human life on Earth could get

191
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Really cruel

192
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
They could get quite Coronavirus

193
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
Clearview says that people viewing his panel

194
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
Preciate it is Frank Frank

195
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
Do it's that Guru zygote that's my trouble

196
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
All the religious groups are against me because I talked about population

197
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
They want more soil

198
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
I want Less on the plan

199
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Sure sure

200
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
In context it's pretty obvious what he means but it sounds

201
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
Just close enough to him saying that he wants to kill everyone over there against

202
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Just run with that address

203
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
You want to go viral in the right-wing media just go through old world economic Forum videos and see if you can find

204
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,719
Somebody saying something that sounds kind of messed up

205
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Eclipse it sound as bad as possible

206
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,583
I posted with the salacious headline folks like Alex will just

207
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
They can't resist that face

208
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
It'll just be

209
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
All over the place within a week

210
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
The problem is

211
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
They're always choosing people with good faith arguments in order to tear them down like I feel like I have been working

212
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,991
My entire career to make the right wing pull out s*** that I say and then use it

213
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
Developed by me and they never do

214
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
They never do

215
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,695
That's been most of your role on the show is like trying to bait

216
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,095
I have not gone viral one time for being at the Satanist devil that I am

217
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
Well you just got to give it to the world economic forum

218
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
I don't think it's Lucas The Improv anymore probably not this clip is going to be important later

219
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
It's not that important

220
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
This is some of the news

221
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
Is there articles everyday about me so many hundreds of them I can't even

222
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Proximal

223
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Every single one of them

224
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,815
I am telling people that there's a plan to kill the public

225
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,423
In response to a story

226
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
And I can't find

227
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Subway

228
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
Is he saying that his problem is

229
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
We're saying that it

230
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
It's fake and that he is in fact

231
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Saying that people should be violet

232
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
No

233
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
No. He's saying that he's not saying people should be fine with that he's not making this up I think it's okay

234
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:55,071
Okay the whole thing okay yeah but just put a pin in all this for now because this is going to come back in a very serious way later

235
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Alex is mad

236
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,751
But there are articles saying that he's suggesting violence because of this globalist depopulation plant

237
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
It's been a long

238
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Time since when

239
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
It certainly has certainly

240
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,991
The media is gas-lighting

241
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,367
You know much like that you know they say that this plan that this evil plan doesn't exist

242
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
All just an exercise and tried to make it

243
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:27,327
Friday April 29th worldwide transmission

244
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
In defense of human Liberty and hard people future

245
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,847
Our will is strong

246
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
Gaslight

247
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,951
World government

248
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Total surveillance

249
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
Forced injection

250
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,399
Depopulation plans ministries of Truth

251
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Choose your old

252
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,871
Relationships all mainstream news

253
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
Them telling you it's a wonderful

254
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
Fantastic idea

255
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Terrible idea

256
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
And I say that man must be silenced

257
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,559
All the major newspapers

258
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Let me know they are

259
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,543
None of that's real most of it though is too vague to be you even worth paying

260
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
The point about the globalist wanting dictatorship

261
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
That's something that's a little bit easier to identify

262
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
It's more concrete than any of the other stuff like it's

263
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Talking points

264
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
Identifiable globulus want dictatorships and that's why we support Putin in his attempt

265
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,279
What's going on what's an interesting comment about Putin coming up a little bit later

266
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,679
Reports on this whole dictator thing is at the globalist

267
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
Newspaper saying the dictatorships are good however

268
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,895
The reality is just that there was a single operating Bloomberg written by a guy who's been a longtime proponent of the idea of Ben Neville

269
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Dictators

270
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
In developing

271
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Countries

272
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,527
What's actually happening is a far cry from what Alex

273
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
The telling his audience

274
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
That's kind of an illustrative

275
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,999
The rest of this is all just right-wing culture War memes that Alex Azar

276
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,119
He's expressing some level of anger that the regular media doesn't agree with him that these things are real

277
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Tiger rest of the show

278
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
That he's got in front of him

279
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
He wouldn't be able to just

280
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,055
Certify that list of clients

281
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
It's

282
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
But thankfully

283
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,943
He doesn't try know that's a smart move on his part instead

284
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
He just gets

285
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Really angry

286
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Myself

287
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Ron Paul

288
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Fordyce

289
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
We're exposing it and you were exposing it

290
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Who You Are

291
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Call Michelle 25

292
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
5 years

293
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,983
Even fighting in the trenches forever and only recently got a shot to beat these people

294
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
Is it God inspire you to find a truth

295
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
I want to tell you from the bottom of my heart

296
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
I just got it

297
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Unbreakable

298
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Pray for God.

299
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
Pour out his Spirit of strength

300
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Focus and clarity

301
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Honor and creativity and life

302
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
God Eternal Father of the universe thank you for the sacrifice of your son

303
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
I just got a million-dollar

304
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Edit

305
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Thank you God

306
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
Thank you for the Consciousness you given us

307
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
Thank you for the wheel

308
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
Thank you for everything you've done

309
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Parentheses

310
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
I got a belly.

311
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
This news is over-the-top

312
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
It's over-the-top bad

313
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,847
Giving it up to The Luminaries like Ron Paul

314
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,175
Hangry thank you to God

315
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Thank you you

316
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Thank you

317
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
I felt incredibly unsafe

318
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
When

319
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,207
This show is probably has no guardrails to this

320
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
We're in the beginning of the show

321
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,351
Write Alex's furiously thanking God

322
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,471
I mean SS somebody with plenty of experience in in in mood swings

323
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
This is too quick

324
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
Of a mood swing for for him to have

325
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
That's just not possible

326
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
You know and it takes

327
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Years of practice

328
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
And medication

329
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
And also you

330
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Ever

331
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Well

332
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Etherized

333
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
And just leads to like a real

334
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,927
Real protracted bit of Rage

335
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Pedophilia is good they say

336
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
World governments good destroying everyone's good

337
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,007
Depopulating is good all simers is good cell phone radiation is good GMOs good

338
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
We deserve what we get but

339
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,087
On the record

340
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
You are not Superior to me

341
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
It was first Bloom of God

342
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
Oh my God he said it on the record

343
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
Furious

344
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,383
If I been unofficial up till this point

345
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Go on the record

346
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
With that

347
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
Trying to get the sense that their plans can be foiled

348
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,807
Not at this point it's very much

349
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,599
Like free Monday

350
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Mentality

351
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,791
Just not fair you should have to least change your sources

352
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
If we're all going to die verses

353
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
We got a shot to death

354
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,239
Your sources are something as nebulous and pointless as your own

355
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
Thoughts and visions

356
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,103
And who cares if he's willing to accept

357
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
My Visions as a source ever

358
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
You don't need to do anything

359
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,111
It's a particular theme show like hey this is my world going to die I'm taken by show

360
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
To use World economic Forum people and then you're like we can stop the global it would be nice if there was a

361
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,143
Revelation of something new that changes the information

362
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Astro

363
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
This is all nonsense

364
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,263
And it's really a platform for Alex to

365
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,359
Make his audience feel things so he doesn't have to I think

366
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
On the record and Shane class Bob and Bill Gates New World Order

367
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
You are not Superior to me

368
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,599
Are superior to you

369
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,976
Superior

370
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,864
We are not going to let you do the same thing. She is that

371
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Understood

372
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Little man

373
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
Hard hair on your filthy murderous heads

374
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
Odd

375
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,384
Okay alright alright come on now

376
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Come on now

377
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Texas

378
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,784
A little dumb this is like the ultimate

379
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Expression

380
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
Of somebody when

381
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Like

382
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,976
If you are a front runner or you you've got the goods you know like

383
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
When Alex

384
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,144
This is at his lowest I quit I'm gone I'm done we're all going to die everybody's dead f*** all of you a little bit

385
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
More momentum as I guess what and you're like dude you're a f****** week

386
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Coward

387
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,736
The other thing is just brings to mind for me is I was in an acting class when I was in like junior high or something like that

388
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
Couple other people project

389
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,648
And I thought it went pretty well we got some good laughs

390
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
We're getting notes

391
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
It's from the teacher

392
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304
She had to explain to me the difference between acting and overact

393
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,144
Alex that note

394
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
Because overactive appreciate my acting teacher be like we got a nip this in the butt

395
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,176
At your turnover enemy call Matt down

396
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,576
Yeah Jim Carrey would tell Alex to tone it down a notch a little realer

397
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Wolf

398
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,232
Hellboy the beginning of that show comes into play again

399
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
Everyone lying about his violence and all that

400
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,728
Confused about how people can possibly think he was trying to stoke his audience towards violence

401
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
About love

402
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
He's even saying the people shouldn't harm a hair on his enemy's head absolutely not it's just that God should send an angel

403
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Crush Alex's enemies

404
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,600
What the problem is that Alex has on way more than one occasion explained that the way God works

405
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,904
Is that he'll send people to do his bidding

406
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Which includes enacting vengeance

407
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
He's been super clear about

408
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
It's like this time

409
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Is Khat

410
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
How does God deliver

411
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
What God delivers engines thrust

412
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Forever this time

413
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
Vengeance is

414
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Dodge

415
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
God has answered

416
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Avengeance

417
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
That's always the twist to the riddle

418
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
Terrorize Josh

419
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Monopoly Sports

420
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Can't you got strung up while your dungeon

421
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
We're going to terrorize you

422
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Orlando Zoo

423
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:52,736
Good bookshelves with vengeance is mine saith the Lord

424
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
Many

425
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,648
A man and woman in history has been used at the implement

426
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
The engine

427
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
For the

428
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Device

429
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,424
There's a very established talking point on Alex's show at

430
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Winky's doing

431
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
It's really really really transparent

432
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
He knows what

433
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
He's doing this is this is garbage

434
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,736
Yeah I think it's it's maybe a bit of a weak spot in our ability to understand things

435
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Where is

436
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
If somebody calls for violence

437
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,600
On one day you're like

438
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
We got you you call for violence but

439
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Space split

440
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
Concepts up over two days you like

441
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Will never catch

442
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
This guy he's too smart for us

443
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
Sprite or is someone explains a metaphor very frequently and then uses the metaphor

444
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
There's no way to connect these two thoughts right right

445
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,504
Smart for us it's really dangerous kind of

446
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,552
Way to behave in. He should be

447
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Really ashamed

448
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:06,464
Pretending to be confused by people critique why would they keep going

449
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
You will be visited

450
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
By the spirit of God

451
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Which one

452
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
You will be

453
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
You okay buddy

454
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
You are not the angel of death

455
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
Angel of death with Wrath

456
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,648
He doesn't sound like a good dude

457
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
EverStart Plus

458
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,168
Now that I've said that to Satan and his minions

459
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Let us move

460
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,056
Terminators

461
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
I know no no no

462
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
No

463
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
No no no no no

464
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
Absolutely

465
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,624
I'm very close to using now that I said that Satan and his minions let's go to the news as a

466
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,976
Out of context dropped surprise

467
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
That's got to be what it is

468
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Yeah I feel like you sounded a lot

469
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
W like a demon

470
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
Can you tell me why you think that you're just in love and God's as like that

471
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,848
Iowa

472
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:33,248
Get the angel of death doesn't mean it's not bird

473
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Bad

474
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,904
It's not really a bad mood for him but it's

475
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
It's f***** up

476
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
Open smood but because

477
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,816
He was so recently f***** up in the triumphant f***** up

478
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,704
Yeah maybe I don't know if I find it I tried it more and more difficult to try and parse his mood

479
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,544
3:00 there's real-world stuff going on

480
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
It's kind of difficult

481
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
The Parson

482
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Complete f****** weirdo on his show

483
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,784
I don't know I may for the next

484
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Short stretch of time just

485
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
Abdicate responsibility to explain what he's doing cuz

486
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,464
It don't make sense

487
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
You could not

488
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
Come to someone more equipped to tell you how he's feeling

489
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:24,960
And I have no f****** clue what do you want to do

490
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
So

491
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
Yeah it complains about Noah Harari the futurist he's pretty mad about

492
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
Probably there's a clip of him I don't really know what

493
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
2 offensive about

494
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Alex's

495
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
Keegan insight

496
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
Here's a clip

497
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
Yesterday

498
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:51,072
Announcing that they need world government to carry out World tyranny

499
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Dial

500
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
Governments around the world sign onto tree

501
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,216
At the UN Ron their medical response to

502
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
Celtics

503
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,456
That continues on with the weapon talk about sick

504
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Talk about twisted

505
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,088
Curious and his latest disgusting declaration

506
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
It was a huge disappointment

507
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,464
To see the lack of Global Leadership

508
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,048
And the lack of global cooperation over the last two years

509
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,704
And the beginning it was like watching the disaster in slow motion

510
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,288
Around the world

511
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
Decisive action could have stopped it

512
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
And that was like. No adults in the room

513
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,904
Okay let's have an international front

514
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,280
Help the country's most teen eat

515
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Express

516
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,728
And before we have this problem

517
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
Global Leadership

518
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Larry strain

519
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
Far be it from us

520
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
To really criticize somebody talkin over

521
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,968
Sure

522
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,040
I Do's I do think that if you were just doing

523
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,112
Possibly racist defensive voices

524
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,744
I would consider that a worthwhile contribution to our show

525
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,048
Like it that's all Alex's

526
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
You probably just got up he literally can't play this clip

527
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Like this clip

528
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
Is counter to his narrative

529
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,544
He's saying that the guy who is evil who is

530
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,920
Orchestrating this whole thing the UN who is created the vaccine that's not a vaccine was created this

531
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,224
Whole f****** pandemic all of this out of

532
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
Out of himself right

533
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
And this guy part of it

534
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
And this guy saying

535
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Here's the problem our reaction was

536
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
No one knew what the f*** was going on

537
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
It is

538
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
The difficult thing

539
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
And I think

540
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
That Alex makes weird noises to help

541
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
Distract people

542
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:08,032
That's true and then I think this is really simple for him to get around and that is him saying like Alex Wood

543
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Say that

544
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
Yeah Harari is saying this

545
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,176
But that's just because they want to do something even more Draconian next

546
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,320
Right I mean if you are there simple pass around that but the service

547
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
What you're saying makes a lot of sense it would be

548
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,952
It would be just swell in a rational world it would be

549
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,048
But that is not where we are baby

550
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,656
I like to imagine a class bike

551
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,752
Like imagine if you taught a class that was in every respect

552
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:44,640
I completely normal class and everyone gave you answers that were reasonable and understandable and you just kept being like

553
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
Next question sorry we are in

554
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Bonkers world

555
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
Nothing makes sense

556
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,136
You're the teacher now

557
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
I got a lot of feelings by climate change

558
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
You're somebody who's

559
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Zurn

560
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Did you know

561
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,264
That we just need to put more CO2 out

562
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,592
Did you know the best answer

563
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Through to the other side

564
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
All right carbon dioxide in the atmosphere previously

565
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
Oxygen

566
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:39,168
Sahara expanding because of lower carbon dioxide last million years

567
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
Reams the desert

568
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,408
How is this racist

569
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Amazing

570
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
I propose

571
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
We do it very quick

572
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
Simple

573
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Sure okay let's put Alex

574
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Into a room

575
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,864
And boost the CO2 up by several plants in their problem

576
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,728
In order to absorb it up by several magnitudes and see how he does

577
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Sure

578
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:21,408
There is a kernel of Truth to what he saying that is that higher CO2 levels are a factor

579
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
In the Sahara Greening

580
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
That is a good understand

581
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Isn't like

582
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Hey

583
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
Deserts are bad

584
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,648
More plants are good

585
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,720
So therefore we need to put CO2 everywhere

586
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,840
Will fix everything to be like he has a very single variable thinking here and it's

587
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Just

588
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,984
Really dumb it is a bit on those lines of like well plants were bigger in the

589
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,848
The Cretaceous. Because there was a larger amount of CO2 in the air so obviously

590
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
To do is recreate those exact same circumstances

591
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,808
Don't you want really big broccoli

592
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
I Blew Up the Kid that was great

593
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,792
Yeah I thought that maybe that would be something that would make you angrier but I guess you've lost her will to fight lost

594
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
Got it anymore

595
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
Still got anymore

596
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Well good we're all dead

597
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,592
Who invented

598
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Fuel

599
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,784
Old is peseta plant

600
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,832
LaunchPad

601
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,584
Because their transmission their job from this

602
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
I will give you power

603
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
Is that

604
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Okay

605
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
The more I listen to this show in the current day like

606
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
The more I think I start to just

607
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,632
Think okay so the plot is basically that like

608
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
There's a battle to get off of her

609
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,848
Basically the entire storyline about humans want to get off of

610
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
Presumably Maybe

611
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,504
He doesn't say this all the time but maybe because there's a war going on in heaven where we're needed

612
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
Saving by way of the globalist or his minions to metal around and keep us for

613
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
I'm leaving Earth

614
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
All Humanity has the instincts

615
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
To escape from Earth

616
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
And get to the habit

617
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
I guess right

618
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,168
But the globalists are trying to

619
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,704
To take it just for themselves

620
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
No

621
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,336
Well maybe but I like they're involved in the war in heaven

622
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
I mean I don't know

623
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
Christmas is that the idea

624
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,088
That's what I keep coming back to

625
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,184
The way that this makes sense to me

626
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,560
Pologize Advanced Alex efficient what he saying

627
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Sometime

628
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
It feels like

629
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
God needs backup

630
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:28,800
That's why he created man on Earth does he has to see if we're good enough to be the backup and so

631
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Do we have to get off

632
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Planet go up to heaven

633
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,664
It helped out it that wore that fighting with the Devil

634
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
Who also works for

635
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,992
And the most important

636
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,600
Is that so far only one man has proved himself worthy to be God's backup

637
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:46,464
Well I say we put them on a rock

638
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,864
Everybody

639
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,936
Alien Alex's whatever he is sediments together

640
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
It's very confusing but I do

641
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
The show maybe had lost

642
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Applaud

643
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
It's days of being about like

644
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
Fractional Reserve banking right okay so if I recall correctly we need

645
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
To eliminate

646
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,648
Foreign aid is a huge issue need to go back to the gold standard

647
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
Wait

648
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,024
Satan wants to keep us on the planet

649
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Alright

650
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,144
Okay anyway Alex a little bit more

651
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
Anti-Cosmo smart-mouth

Walking around pedone's act like he's all high-and-mighty

Up there laughing about populator symptom really get on it for him

657
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
Let's hear from this piece of garbage

658
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,184
Sew-in.

659
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304

A shotgun in your mouth and blow your brains out buddy

663
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
Pour gasoline on yourself

664
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
Story building

665
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Out of my way

666
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
You want to kill people

667
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,496
Running your freaking mouth talking about it

668
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
What

669
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Turn the lights on

670
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
You want death brother

671
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Besides

672
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:55,488
It's just like it was trying to do a Macho Man Randy Savage promo

673
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
You know

674
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
Just goes to show that this

675
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
This is a man

676
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Cool of

677
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Free speech

678
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
Who wants

679
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:07,264
A diverse array of opinions in his life also quite tolerant

680
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
Absolutely

681
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
Pickle liberal dance

682
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,712
Free Speech I'm really concerned that you're missing the most

683
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,272
Important part of shoot-first-ask-questions-later

684
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Well I got to say

685
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Alex

686
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,280
Real violin

El gross

689
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
God

00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
God is going to stomp you into the ground

691
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216

Nothing says I love you more

699
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,568
It won't be us to go to the furnace it'll be you

700
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
You asked for it

701
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
You are Conjuring us

702
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
You are rising

703
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016

00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
You

707
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
You will die

708
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536

Luciferian

714
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:54,016
Belt run out of steam

715
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,600
That's probably the trouble with his failing cardio

716
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:02,976
If you want to keep insulting people like that

717
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,840
I also think that if you really listen to what he's a few things

718
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:14,240
My followers are going to kill you and it's your fault

719

722
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,552
Murder you

723
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:34,208

724
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
Hi buddy

00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Wild

727
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
Anyway this dude

728
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Asking

Bring

730
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
You asked for it

00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Godzilla

732
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783

Happened to you

736
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
In all your rituals you can do

737
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Karmic energy

738
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Will not be

739
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Thousand

740
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,263
Times stronger and will incinerate you

741
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
Because I am rubber

742
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
Because you are glue

743
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,943
You have announced you want to kill everybody

744
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
Because deep down you know it's you

745
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Todai

746
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
You want us to die

747
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
I got a better idea

748
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
I got a better idea

749
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Pray

750
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,607
Dreamy creamy summer

751
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
For justice

752
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
He asked God

753
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Punished

754
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
If we get hurt

755
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
That's just collateral damage in it

756
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
This is incredibly f***** up

757
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:17,631
No he was going to die everybody's going to die and it was because he was sad and now everybody's going to die cuz he

758
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:22,239
He's wealthy enough to afford it maybe his enemies are going to die

759
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Insane

760
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,591
This is this is a level of like

761
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,151
Being fairly overt about like

762
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
Basically poking the audience be like

763
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Hey

764
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,063
Someone should kill somebody this is unacceptable like

765
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:41,183
It's if we're at the intervention levels normal that's for sure

766
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,023
Exit not good no I was pretty shocked

767
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
I will say that

768
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,655
If you understand the code that he's using essentially

769
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,215
And it's not very difficult you don't need

770
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:58,079
Some kind of a codebreaker to

771
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,663
We're not windtalkers why don't we pray

772
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Right

773
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,063
Why don't we pray for God to punish these people that you and me pray together

774
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,855
So we're going to be praying

775
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,927
For God to do this but we know that God operates

776
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Through

777
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
Alex is audience

778
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
Maybe men and women who want to

779
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,679
Do a little thing for God do God a favor maybe you feel like with the prayer was about

780
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:28,543
You I'm not saying it is I'm not saying it's not spraying for one of his

781
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
Audience members

782
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
Tequila sadguru

783
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Pretty f*****-up

784
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Yeah

785
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Yeah

786
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:41,087
Especially for somebody that he literally did not really care about up until like 20 seconds

787
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743
Can't say that I remember him here hearing him talk about it when he went from zero to murder victim

788
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,279
Very quickly

789
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
Comment that Alex's

790
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,167
Triggered by and going off on this rant about 3 years

791
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
So that's cool

792
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
Anyway Alex also doesn't like how we drive

793
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
That's what it is

794
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
Buggy

795
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Creeping around actonel

796
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Guarantee you

797
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
You put him on the rack

798
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
What

799
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,463
He'll Peckerwood moment

800
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
5 Seconds

801
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
Why are you fighting

802
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
God

803
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Is the Brainerd

804
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
Lucifer

805
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
You little twit

806
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Cool

807
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
John Lennon outfit

808
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,503
Depopulation

809
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,319
Songs about it

810
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
But he lives on

811
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,255
You're not garbage

812
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
Yeah it's a Bradley Joe Biden's murder was a globalist

813
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,727
Who's my it was on me for assuming that it couldn't couldn't

814
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
I wonder if you think

815
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,055
Paul was

816
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
Replaced

817
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,127
That theory

818
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,783
That's not criticizing Indian man

819
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
Inspired by

820
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
Another Indian guy

821
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,951
Yeah yeah yeah it's more like John Lennon was misappropriated

822
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:28,351
And then he's but he's not calling that style of where a John Lennon outfit is kind of telling on yourself in terms of

823
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
It's a little bit like

824
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
Wearing a dashiki now being like seeing it's like what Nancy Pelosi War you're just stealing Nancy Pelosi s*** yeah

825
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:43,199
So Alex is really mad and he's he's getting into this this weird head space

826
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,271
He also has time for a couple headlines here and there

827
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Where's one of them

828
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,879
Challenger coming in and dumping

829
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Thousands in

830
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
Thousands of tractors and trucks for dumping thousand thousand

831
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
No one is buying that macron one by

832
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
15 points or whatever

833
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
Santa Claus

834
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
Rap God

835
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
Are saying you clean it up.

836
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
You go ahead and

837
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
Just enjoy yourself

838
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
We're done

839
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
Sitting through that two tons of manure were dropped outside of a building that houses the office of a politician from macrons political party

840
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,791
And it was done

841
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
In an act of protest

842
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,399
However Alex is failing to mention that this happened in August 29th

843
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:42,847
There is a recent story although it's kind of hard to find good sourcing on it about Farmers dropping manure in front of supermarkets in the

844
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,639
City of Powell as a protest

845
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
How about Rising price

846
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,991
Right they were like we are farmers

847
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
We're done

848
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,671
There's a town about 75,000 people or to compared to u.s. City it's the size of Evans

849
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,279
I'm not sure if this is as big of a deal is Alex's making it out today quite frankly

850
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,095
Also I want to point this out

851
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:09,983
French Farmers protest by dropping manure all the time all the time

852
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
Just Google it

853
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,847
What is while it happens a lot

854
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Can do it man

855
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,175
Yeah kind of farmers protest

856
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
Choice is clearly

857
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,503
Putting manure where people don't want it to be

858
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,319
It just seems too obvious but we don't do it

859
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:32,511
I'm not too I'm not encouraging I don't want I don't want to mess around there

860
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,327
I rather not be right there

861
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
It's not right there

862
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:40,447
So Alex gets off the news cuz

863
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,495
There's more second to talk about and what have you

864
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
I love you

865
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,639
Finished

866
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
About to do

867
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,711
Momentarily. Apparently back to Satan

868
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,295
Alex has made this comparison a bunch of

869
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
The past that like if there was just

870
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,367
The corrupt government

871
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
I wouldn't be like that

872
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,719
We'd love Jessica Rabbit

873
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,071
Bounds on this a little bit and he said some things that are accidentally like really reveal a share

874
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
Again

875
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:14,495
Boss Hog

876
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,799
Hey we should not Boss Hog

877
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,391
Can I do things in the round

878
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,023
That's My Life by Boss Hogg

879
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,103
Boss Hog over here is the old-fashioned thing

880
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,711
King George the third with Boss Hogg not that bad

881
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
What

882
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
But

883
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,487
Not going to go 100% crazy eyes

884
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,839
Into a fight against Boss Hogs cuz I'm a little bit of y'all are

885
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,911
Alex was a loyalist

886
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
Alex would not have fought the Revolutionary War

887
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,335
Because Alex is a coward who loves

888
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:27,455
To kowtow in black boots Revolution

889
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:33,855
F*** you Thomas Jefferson your s*** was b******* why'd you put it on the line for a Boss Hogg it's just a Boss Hog

890
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
Adjustable dog this reveals about Alex 02 and really care about corruption

891
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:46,399
One of his long-running bumpers are we coming back from commercials with is how he's all about fighting corruption but

892
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
Club true at all

893
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,775
Totally fine with corrupt even the large-scale like organized corruption

894
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Apparently

895
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,127
If the corruption is focused in the right direction and it doesn't involve

896
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
Any of the elements of his personal

897
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
Identity being threatened

898
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:04,319
Cuz that's really apparently what he cares about

899
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,367
To the kind of make him sound like a super sensitive baby

900
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,415
And maybe less

901
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Appealing as a

902
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
Guy who goes

903
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:16,607
Growl radio obsessed

904
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
Monster is less

905
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
Interesting then with an ink

906
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,799
Credibly bruised insensitive identity

907
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,847
All the time

908
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,639
Play non-stop Whiting

909
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:35,039
Stop projecting you ever it's like a dog that's left alone that's left home alone all day

910
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,111
Hey you know and zip the dogs owners

911
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
They're at work they don't know how much

912
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,743
The dog whines all day everyday but you walked by there and you know

913
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,791
Alldayeveryday non-stop wine

914
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
That Alex

915
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,935
He's a whining dog just imagine if that dog didn't have a radio show

916
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,543
So Alex I don't know how else to explain this it seems to be him

917
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:00,383
Describing an argument that he had with God within his own head sure

918
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
This is on the radio

919
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,199

And whatever you need you're going to get it

925
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
But you gotta man up

926
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,359
Voice of the Holy Spirit and discernment

927
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Conscience

928
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
Connecting with that

929
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
Program

930
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
He is demanding

931
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
Enough

932
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,791
You are a coward you are weak telling you

933
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,519
And if you don't give me a hundred percent I'm going to dump you in with these people

934
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
I'm just like

935
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:12,575
You're going to do this you signed on for this and you're going to execute this car I'm going

936
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
How much

937
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
And I don't know if you know this person

938
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,119
But just like ballpark in Europe

939
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
How much

940
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,727
Math could you buy with a million in Bitcoin

941
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,055
Look I don't know what's going rate is

942
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,895
I never what I never did know what they're doing right was so

943
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,711
Be tough for me to Ballpark

944
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503
Yeah I mean look

945
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,295
There's there's some problems with

946
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
The mental state

947
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
He's presenting

948
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,207
Like there's delusion

949
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,255
Underneath a lot of

950
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,303
A lot of it is before

951
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
It's a lot of it is just like

952
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,399
He's a himself up at shadow

953
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,703
Incredibly over-the-top and like I said overactive

954
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
And a lot of places

955
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:08,639
But some of these ideas that he's expressing also seem to be somewhat in line with things you said of the path

956
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:13,247
Idea of like I'm really feeling conflicted within his head of

957
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,063
Voices yelling at him to do things out early

958
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,343
Kind of checks out

959
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Yeah

960
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:22,207
I do I do like you about that I do like him being like

961
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
Amman

00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:29,375
You gotta man up and it's like man what's that million Runs Out you are suddenly going to find you're not a man are you

963
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:35,775
I learned that the global plan is so important

964
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
I quit all the time

965
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
Quitter

966
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,919

Please.

968
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:50,879
The New World Order you think I fear the mainstream media

969
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
Deliberate

970
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,839
Focused babe

971
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
Whatever you say

972
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
God says

973
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,999
You want for lunch if you wanted this

974
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
It's so beautiful and so great

975
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Sao Paulo

976
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,775
Everything seems really for

977
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,919
Gravely the lamps with always right there

978
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
What are we doing here

979
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:59,231
This feels voyeuristic yeah I was really gross

980
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
Presence

981
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
I'm ashamed

982
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Call Todd

983
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,631
And so I'm going to hate you

984
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
And I'm going to try to be you

985
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
At the same time

986
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,031
Because I don't like the way you make me feel

987
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
I don't like

988
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
You're so good

989
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
Yes

990
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
10

991
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
That's what goes on and saying bring

992
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,303
Satan has a brain

993
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
Sure

994
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,631
You know what eats

995
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,031
Yeah man I will boy

996
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,335
Hey I'm worried what are we doing

997
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:51,199
I don't know what is happening why are we Whispering about

998
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:57,599
What did Jesus man what are you wearing

999
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Also

1000
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,927
I'm not going to throw this out here

1001
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
I'm going to tell you this right now

1002
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,999
You

1003
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,791
Are required

1004
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,375
To refuse an unlawful order even if it's from God

1005
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:14,495
Is that right it does not protect you legally it does not protect you legally like

1006
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,799
Look if God shows up and he's like hey Jordan

1007
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
You better go genocide those Canaanites

1008
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
No God

1009
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
I refuse

1010
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,199
I think that's

1011
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,527
Brave of you I think I also like

1012
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
I keep running into this

1013
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
I don't know how to put

1014
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
This exactly

1015
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
I think Alex is a terrible spokesman for God

1016
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:39,839
He's really better on the fence about God and I was like this is this is what it looks like

1017
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,375
Not what this thumbs down

1018
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
Yep sounds

1019
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,447
Conflicted even about like

1020
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:48,031
Elementary things about reality utterly insane

1021
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,591
Totally

1022
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
Batman and his

1023
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
His

1024
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,199
Barely in control of his own

1025
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,991
It's simple emotional state

1026
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
Like simple stuff

1027
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
Like let's just pick it back up

1028
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
Thousand feet to the

1029
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,903
Bird's eye view

1030
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
If your impression

1031
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
God is

1032
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
I want you to

1033
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,023

That's bad God of God is you agreed to do this thing for me this

1035
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:20,031
Side mission that you're going on and a hundred percent

1036
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:26,431
Burn you pay weekly to Hell a little weakling how do you feel now you're so weak

1037
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
That's not no bad guy

1038
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:32,831
Impression of God I don't think all of his gods

1039
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,855
Spar

1040
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
Pretty much s***

1041
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,695
They remind me a lot of him ask

1042
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,975
Discernment

1043
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,999
Does not care for

1044
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,351
We have something new to bring to the audience

1045
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
Attention

1046
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,423
From the person who brought you

1047
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
Stachys

1048
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,751
And the person who brought you breaking news

1049
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,543
I know but you

1050
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
Ague

1051
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,759
Brianna k

1052
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,087
Marvel level

1053
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,415
Watch what I'll do to your eggs

1054
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Bugatti

1055
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
God says

1056
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
What

1057
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Why

1058
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,591
Why did God do this because God

1059
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
Did

1060
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,895
What was right

1061
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,967
Why shouldn't God create

1062
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
What

1063
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,903
Why should God create new entities that have free will

1064
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,255
Oh cuz that was selfish of me.

1065
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
To do that

1066
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,655
God is the ultimate fate

1067
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
Your God is the ultimate

1068
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,895
God

1069
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Created

1070
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,687
Freewell

1071
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
God

1072
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,039
Works for God

1073
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343
Oh my God

1074
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,183
God doesn't do what Satan does

1075
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:19,583
Know what God did order Satan to do this

1076
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:25,215
Yes I forgot because I'm free

1077
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,055
See if that was something that I was wondering about myself because

1078
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,663
If you work for somebody and you can't be fired then you don't work for them

1079
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Yeah

1080
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,223
Look

1081
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,343
As I was getting this episode ready I cut some of these clips in

1082
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
I have nothing

1083
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:49,279
I legitimately

1084
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Uberti

1085
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,959
From whatever you get out of that and probably write most of what I took from that is

1086
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:02,847
He's on one and we now have Aggie's

1087
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
It's just like

1088
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,663
Try and make sense

1089
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,479
Of what you're saying about your own beliefs

1090
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,551
Look none of them were great but at least most of them

1091
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
Try to make sense

1092
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,879
Yeah you're out there like 8 listen

1093
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
The ultimate Evil and he's trying

1094
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,743
And kill you God's ultimate good and you created free will

1095
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,559
Satan works for God but God doesn't do with Satan doesn't God

1096
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,863
Tell take me to do that stuff Satan works for God

1097
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,167
God didn't tell him to do that and that beat

1098
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
Val

1099
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:34,335
Clothes swap

1100
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,943
I think he does make some sense I think you'll agree

1101
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,479
Somebody

1102
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,295
I don't know his read some

1103
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
Fantasy novels

1104
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,367
I think you might learn some

1105
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
Put some of this

1106
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,927
We're going to go break

1107
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,519
You go to the next level agency lemonade you're going to realize

1108
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,567
But there is a lot more going on

1109
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
So complex is so fantastic

1110
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
It's so real I can't even interpret

1111
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,967
It's nothing in literature in art

1112
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
Culture

1113
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,783
Totally all of it's just completely

1114
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,855
Go to Hollywood right now

1115
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
The delicious new

1116
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Because

1117
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
The average person

1118
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
No access to it

1119
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
And

1120
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,887
So much of what you see

1121
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
That's what it is

1122
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Puppies

1123
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,671
The whole nine yards

1124
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
What

1125
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
Portal

1126
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Sauron

1127
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,655
LaSalle

1128
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,727
I mean

1129
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,287
Infowars.com tomorrow's news today weather

1130
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
No,

1131
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:18,015
Cuz I got one speaks mad about that from like a nerdy perspective but honestly what I'm really mad about

1132
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,855
Is it somebody needs to put this person into therapy immediately

1133
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:27,231
He's not going to cut it any number of things

1134
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
Specialist

1135
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,303
Why does he have lawyers

1136
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:37,215
He's a busy street surrounded with doctors at all times just like product trying to figure out

1137
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:41,311
What it is that makes him this way

1138
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
Like

1139
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,919
I don't understand

1140
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,271
Dab like me

1141
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,295
ICS

1142
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:56,159
The depths of the metaphysical World beyond Godzilla

1143
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:00,255
It's just like Sarah.

1144
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,327
Clothes wearing in the movie It

1145
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
I could

1146
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,679
Go to Hollywood and be number one

1147
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,775
Because what I've seen is like nothing anyone else have seen there before

1148
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
Here's my example

1149
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:19,455
Something that someone else has seen and done better made a bunch of times

1150
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:24,063
I run into Ziggy's talking about like how this is beyond anyone's imagination of science-fiction and like

1151
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,647
Version of reality is just old science-fiction

1152
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,975
It's all there I don't think is very robust

1153
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:37,375
I mean the Sci-Fi well I'm in the special effects on his imagination stop somewhere around Logan

1154
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
Run

1155
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
I think we're good

1156
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,751
So that was be messed up first hour of the show

1157
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
That was that was

1158
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Yep boy

1159
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
Could you skip that one

1160
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,175
No

1161
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,479
It was intense

1162
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
Yep

1163
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,831
Hernandez

1164
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:01,439
And a lot of these interview is Alex kind of trying to apologize because like

1165
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:04,511
Back when she worked at Infowars you like to go out your woman

1166
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
But you can't go out to

1167
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,327
The protests are too dangerous for a woman

1168
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:13,983
I meant ukulele and I do want to work for the Blazing.

1169
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,007
I should have

1170
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,567
Stuck with you but I'm too much of a

1171
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,615
Kimberly chauvinist

1172
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,151
Workout negative

1173
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:27,551
I don't believe in the potential of women because of it

1174
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
You could have done had

1175
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
Child

1176
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Yeah

1177
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,255
She's in the second hour and I don't care it's not very interesting

1178
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
But

1179
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,351
Gaston comes into the third hour

1180
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,887
Big f****** news

1181
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
But

1182
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
We are now joined

1183
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,775
Tower

1184
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
By the mighty

1185
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,103
Rodger Stone

1186
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,455
Rodger on talk about Elon Musk going about Russia

1187
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,575
Wow

1188
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
I didn't call you want to bug you

1189
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,511
It was banned

1190
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
Add

1191
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,703
The New York Times Washington Post got a rubbing a poster all right here

1192
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,239
And then you text me you go

1193
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,407
Yeah Manhattan

1194
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:32,063
So if it was a fake account that tried to rejoin Twitter is Rodger Stone USA it was someone with a remarkable level of

1195
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
Connection to Rodger

1196
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:39,487
Possibly access to some of his passwords I know who is the rap

1197
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:43,071
Posted on his telegram account well b****** hunt back on Twitter

1198
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,655
I'm anxious to see how strong Elon Musk commitment to freeze peaches

1199
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
So this is just sort of a fake

1200
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:55,103
Twitter they must have access to Rogers telegram account to

1201
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Back when

1202
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:01,247
Credit

1203
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:07,647
The Daily Beast reached out to Rodger for comment and he said quote I posted a new account to prove a point I look forward to whoever May

1204
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,951
Made the decision to suspend getting fired

1205
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,231
Attention Elon Musk

1206
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
So

1207
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,863
It have to be like a fake account that has his telegram password and is able to critically

1208
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,239
Critically impersonate him to eternal atake

1209
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,799
This seems like to be a large-scale

1210
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,359
Security problem on Rogers end of things

1211
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
Obviously what happened to that Rodger created a Twitter account to find a way to save face

1212
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
No at all what the the details are

1213
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,367
Just trying to like

1214
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:44,511
Like I have fake news of the media unfortunately isn't going to play along with Alex

1215
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,095
Because Rodger did make that account okay

1216
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:52,447
Unfortunately Alex lifeson talking and Rodger deflates the hoe

1217
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,031
Moving on from that Rodger still dumped from Twitter

1218
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Almost

1219
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
More

1220
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,223
Latest pieces of disinformation

1221
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,807
So what I did Alex to

1222
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,343
My point was

1223
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,391
Instead of trying to get my

1224
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:14,719
Currently suspended Twitter page

1225
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,255
Reinstated where I had

1226
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,303
Just short of a million followers

1227
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,863
Purposely posted a new Pro

1228
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
Profile

1229
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,655
Confident

1230
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,263
Current walk Staffing Twitter with band me immediately

1231
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:32,383
And it only took six hours early talk to you

1232
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,431
What's an official counter

1233
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:41,087
Also I had my information wrong and then I accused the media of passing off fake story they can't possibly

1234
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,183
Well I had it wrong it's not worried about it

1235
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,279
Now it's kind of funny though Rogers explanation for why

1236
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
He did this

1237
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,887
And it's pretty clear based on his own words and this

1238
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,655
Makes me

1239
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,679
Very sad

1240
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
But then I begin to see

1241
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,799
Lists of those who have

1242
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,079
Unjustly bin

1243
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,615
Deplatform including

1244
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
President Donald Trump

1245
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,943
You of course Alex Jones

1246
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
When

1247
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,087
The others

1248
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,135
Noticed

1249
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:18,207
Missing from all those lists in all honesty

1250
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
Should speakers

1251
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:23,583
Play back in 2017

1252
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,375
Pioneer

1253
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,191
And as you pointed out to me at the time

1254
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,239
Platform

1255
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
No conservatives Rose to my defense

1256
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,895
No other conservatives were outraged

1257
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:43,551
Yeah I know to talkin about him I want to I want to reduce my conservative buddies now

1258
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:49,951
Now that they're willing to come out publicly and drive

1259
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:59,423
Is everybody's a giant piece of s***

1260
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,823
Hey this person needs to get back on Twitter and they forgot about me I need to put myself back in therapy

1261
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:12,223
The original hipster band guy just basically doing a publicity stunt

1262
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,503
By giving himself rehband

1263
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,319
Computer so people remember that he's not

1264
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
San Jose

1265
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,927
Sad very sad so sad

1266
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
Hello

1267
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,255
Vasquez a truth-teller

1268
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,815
Did Rodger measure or sense

1269
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Sore

1270
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,119
What do words mean

1271
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:32,703
No but Rodger is an interesting interpretation

1272
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
Twitter accepting

1273
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,775
Mosques offer

1274
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,151
You're right I just think he's a truth-teller

1275
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,943
Asian entrepreneur

1276
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
And most importantly he understood

1277
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,807
It came to a tender offer

1278
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
Or Twitter

1279
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,367
Money talks and

1280
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,903
Blocks

1281
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,231
At the end of the day

1282
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,535
If they put aside their ideas

1283
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,887
Russian free speech by people like Alex Jones

1284
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,423
And Rodger Stone

1285
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,215
Laura Loomer and others

1286
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
And they talk

1287
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:11,103
The money think it takes for him to get full control like at what point do we get mad

1288
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,175
They hasn't platforms

1289
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,087
Alex can't wait to get mad about not being

1290
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:27,487
I know he wants his turn

1291
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,071
The whole thing redo all over again

1292
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,887
Fake news

1293
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:39,007
Rogers describing like literally shouldn't be possible

1294
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,799
In the world that Alex

1295
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
Does created

1296
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Like

1297
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
The globalist

1298
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,127
I have

1299
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,943
These are Jen does and what have you no amount of money

1300
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,503
Should be possible to buy Twitter

1301
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,527
Because

1302
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,855
They have their ideological agenda Twitter is

1303
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,647
Apparently essential for

1304
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
So it just

1305
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,695
This is nonsense

1306
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,231
Are contradicting your own

1307
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:05,375
Premise your entire the rules of the universe Ilan has to be a globalist or

1308
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
None of it makes

1309
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,935
Well he will be

1310
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:08,959
If

1311
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,799
You know he ends up buying Twitter and then Alex and get back

1312
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:17,151
Preemptively

1313
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,711
When can I make that my narrative

1314
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,735
Yeah

1315
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,551
And he's either to use itching for it

1316
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
Rodger Stone buenaveza

1317
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,695
You know this

1318
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
He loves

1319
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
Adidas

1320
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,863
And it's affected

1321
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Political position

1322
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:42,239
Libertarian conservative

1323
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,823
Pro-abortion

1324
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,919
In Jesus Christ

1325
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,455
Radically I'm now

1326
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
Berry pro-life

1327
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:01,695
You're definitely not faking

1328
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Yeah oh yeah

1329
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,791
I have noticed a thing and I wish that I had

1330
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,815
Little isolated these

1331
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:11,167
Please make a Supercut but pretty much every time Rodger Stone and religion come up

1332
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
Alex is like you're not pregnant

1333
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
Kind of

1334
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
Suspicious

1335
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:34,463
So what are the things that I've noticed that Rodger has been saying a lot when he comes on the show is basically

1336
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,255
How can I

1337
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,559
Grab Victory from the jaws of defeat

1338
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,399
That's why they're in such a hurry Alex is our friend Tucker

1339
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,727
They don't act like people

1340
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,519
Who have the luxury of time

1341
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,079
They know that every single day

1342
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:54,687
Are there more and more Americans are waking up to what's going on

1343
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:01,087
All a very regularly he cites Tucker Carlson is saying that the enemies of the Patriots

1344
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,647
They don't act like people who have a lot of time

1345
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,719
All right in a couple minutes later Rodger says this

1346
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:11,839
America will be won or lost between now and this November

1347
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,399
We do not have the luxury of time folks

1348
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
This is it

1349
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,471
This is the struggle for freedom

1350
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:21,567
What you're acting like you don't have the luxury of that I'm starting to think

1351
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
That maybe

1352
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
Now and throw this out there

1353
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,175
Maybe this is a lot of

1354
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,455
Projection

1355
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:30,015
In order to obtain the results

1356
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,855
As though the instigator was the enemy as opposed to you

1357
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,135
You're with your best friend

1358
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,415
Himself Alex Jones

1359
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:42,303
You might you might be onto something a little bit I guess I just think it's really funny when you use the exact same expression

1360
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,607
About your enemies and then yourself

1361
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,191
I mean are you sad about man

1362
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
Who

1363
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
You know I just

1364
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
I'm just

1365
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:56,639
Grateful in these trying times that Rodger can rely on

1366
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
The Lord's Supper

1367
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,431
Well

1368
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,991
The Lord so far

1369
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,039
If Rodger does a dude he's supposed to

1370
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,599
Obviously

1371
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,903
Rodger is on thin ice with God

1372
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,183
Bi-Rite

1373
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,023
Probation at least

1374
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:17,119
I would keep her on a short leash

1375
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:22,495
Nothing but verify

1376
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,287
Where's your God dealing with

1377
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,103
Option hours

1378
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
It's not going to

1379
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:32,991
I can take his word for it I feel like you're full of s*** man ever heard of you

1380
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:39,391
I've been burned by Nixon Associates before

1381
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:48,607
Your man is Rogers interviews a lot of like

1382
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:53,215
Very repetitive

1383
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,263
Booth with few exceptions

1384
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
But

1385
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
I think

1386
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,663
Definitely tell a changing of tone

1387
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:06,527
I'm kind of interested to see what

1388
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
Ynobe

1389
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
Beginning of this week

1390
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,623
How Alex will be behaving because

1391
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,415
News

1392
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:18,815
About this million dollars a bit going to believe he broke on was that Friday I believe

1393
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:26,751
Forgotten this million-dollar spaghetti then but I'm not entirely sure if I come out

1394
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
I don't know if it come out

1395
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,823
While he's doing the show

1396
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,895
I know that the news came out on Friday

1397
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,735
And that they said he closed the account like two days before they

1398
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:40,575
So yeah so he's got a million dollars hanging out

1399
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,855
Burning a hole in his paw

1400
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
Pocket right now

1401
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
Much like

1402
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
God's judgement

1403
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
Burning a hole in

1404
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:54,399
Yeah I'm interested to see cuz I think that's going to be a much more

1405
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,191
Telling episode

1406
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
One side

1407

Just bring it up at all

1408
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:08,479
Some kind of really unhinged

01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:14,879
Beer what and we'll see we'll see we'll be back on Wednesday to check in on that but tell them Jordan

Audrey mccreamy song

The sex robot

1417
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:39,711
