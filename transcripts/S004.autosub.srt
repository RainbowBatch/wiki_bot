00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:08,960
Welcome back for you

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,872
A little bit of a scheduling difficulty I had to go get my stitches taken out

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,200
From my minor surgery that I had recently

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,808
And so you know what with work schedules whenever you have time to get together

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,904
But I wanted to get something out for you here on this Wednesday to enjoy

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:33,024
It seems to me like perhaps a great opportunity to make a little bit of it

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
About business

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:40,704

11
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,360
And I want to try and sweeten the pot a little bit in terms of what you get if you donate

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
Not great at making buttons or

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,832
Bumper stickers or as we apparently

00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
Knowledge fight podcast

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
That which may be in the works

16
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
I'm not great at that stuff

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,328
But I do like creating content for you and making shows

18
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,472

00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240

31

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
I'm sure that I

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
Start it up and then abandoned about a year-and-a-half ago or so I put out one episode about it

34
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064

You to think existed

45
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
So I felt

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Maybe

47
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,392
We should take this opportunity for you to get a little taste of what the heck show is

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Because

49
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,536
It's a little different than just listening to Alex Bunch certainly different than that

50
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,352
Also here I would like to present to you

51
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,168

55
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712

I don't remember anything about it but I

58
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952

251
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,895
In that world you're never taught

00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
School

253
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479

They tried to take over Europe

259
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Also they believe

260
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
That there was a

261
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
A fountain of youth

262
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,863
Just thought there was all these like

00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Remember

266
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,455

267
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223

00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Parodies like

00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Native people

272
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
And they were so fast

273
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Plaster casts

274
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Their faces

275
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
We're like okay

276
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543

277
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,871

278
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,711
Straw or some type of breathing apparatus.

279
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,271
Ocean

280
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Nazis but

00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,327
Respond

282
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,935
Your point with all that though is that real

283
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,263
Stuff that happened in our history where I'm just like

284
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Who thought this was okay

285
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
DIY pretty crazy

286
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,991
That that mentality does also inform our our modern lives

287
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Send it like

288
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,879
It'd be stupid for us to think that whatever culture is

289
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
Is today

290
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
F*** is that alright

291
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
Short attic is it good gay people how was your day

292
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
And women are trans

293
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,983
That's a very much bleeds into our topic

294
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
I wonder what like even like

295
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
Like when a woman got her. They must have

296
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
Like I know from a lot of

297
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,415
Religious text

298
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
You are unclean yeah you must go to the shack

299
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
Hurry up.

300
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
I have to assume

301
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
Even in caveman times there was like

302
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
Alright you go to that part of the case no one can touch her

303
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
Yeah that's everything I wore their real

304
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
You think those cavemen were popping the cork

305
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,111
Jesus

306
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
Can we strike that from the record

307
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
Why did I say that

308
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
Anyway

309
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
Another another

310
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
It's kind of crazy how there's such an cuz I think I was watching MSNBC

311
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
And they were talking about

312
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,407
51% of women

313
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
So crazy how

314
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
More like so equal a dump

315
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
That's true

316
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
That's weird

317
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
Why is that weird

318
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,903
Why isn't there like 30% men 70% women

319
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
I think because of how you know how genetic coin toss

320
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Yeah basically with coin tosses

321
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
If you have a million coin tosses that'll be a proxy

322
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
500000 heads

323
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Approximately 500

324
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
Seven billion people on the planet

00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Don't know number 7

326
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,199
Yeah it's you have that of course it's going to be about 50

327
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
The coin flip

328
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,855

329
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767

382
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,088
I feel like I wasn't paying attention

383
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
In school which is

384
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Impossibility

385
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Americado a pro wrestling Illustrated

386
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
Folded up in my notebook and

387
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
I was reading it

388
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Taking notes

389
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
Dreaming of one day being the next

390
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,936
Meltzer

391
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
The card that I was going to have

392
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Wrestlers

393
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
I got home

394
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
I could definitely see you being a fanfiction

395
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,944
Felt maybe even still today I love

396
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Witches

397
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
Dark arts

398
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,648
Perfect knuckle tattoos

399
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
And I I

400
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
I also love

401
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
I am passing by the idea of a society

402
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Freaking out

403
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Yeah over some words like

404
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,752
What's even Within

405
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
The context of a

406
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
Trial that went on

407
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,248
Yeah yeah

408
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
Everybody basically accepted that magic in the Supernatural s*** was real

409
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
Part of it

410
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,768
He's almost like the force in some ways from Star Wars

411
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
That there's some of that

412
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
Little bit of context

413
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Situation

414
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,472
From February 16th to May 6th

415
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
1693

416
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
That's ovary

417
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,616
Year it was going on

418
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,944
What does Delaware

419
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
It was in Salem Village

420
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Large

421
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,600
Okay

422
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,160
Man

423
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,704
Village

424
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,264
Cuz there was Salem Village

425
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
There were two different entities

426
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
The time

427
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,640
But we're very closely involved with each other

428
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
Robust

429
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
Tile town

430
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,600
For they were Industries

431
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
1500 dime

432
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
Was a far more agricultural rooted

433
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Area

434
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
So

435
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
You know what I didn't hear it

436
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:41,984
You know what that was that was not where I had a problem with Shyamalan

437
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
Love the idea

438
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
The Purge great idea

439
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
The Purge

440
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
Has my boys

441
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,272
I love Ethan Hawke I love the Hawkeye read the hottest summer his book

442
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,672
Much as I do

443
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Heard it was

444
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,584
Too long congratulatory / 12

445
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
That is super impressive

446
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
They're going to call it 12 years old

447
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Good

448
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,896
Executed

449
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
Over the course of this

450
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Year

451
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
They were familiars

452
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,136
And s*** like that or just

453
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,000
Actually accused of being male

454
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
20 people who were executed

455
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
Free was killed by putting rocks on top of him

456
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,944
Well the reason

457
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,552
Not guilty

458
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,120
If he said not guilty and was found guilty he would have to give up rights to his estate

459
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,240
Giving a please

460
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
He protected his estate

461
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
So

462
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
In situations where they don't give a

463
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,664
You still going to torture a little bit in order to get them to please

464
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,760
So they put a board on top of it and just started pressing rocks on top

465
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,832
Giving rocks

466
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,160
I think it I think it said it took two days

467
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
Of him to be impressed by bored

468
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
The other one

469
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,424
5 people died in prison

470
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
Because of

471
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
Conditions

472
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Incarceration

473
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
Again

474
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Is my eye

475
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
Oftentimes to be misinformed when we're talking

476
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
Nope sound

477
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
YouTube

478
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Think about

479
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Mistrial

480
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
Was that like

481
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,328
Thankfully they do like a witch

482
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
We're going to like light you on fire

483
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
You are a witch

484
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,984
To survive it if you're not well

485
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,848
We were wrong from the English

486
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,896
Oh okay

487
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,272
To do it

488
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,904
Instances in New England of them being again

489
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
You won't drown

490
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
To do more with that

491
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
English variety

492
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Like

493
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,168
Such like flawed logic

494
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,752
Sending out these sentences know that

495
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,616
Because it's a thing works like what the problem solved itself

496
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Either we're right or we were on but she's

497
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,248
It's a lot of

498
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,088
Individual people who

499
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
So much of it makes me think of Socrates

500
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
Cuz

501
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
Greece

502
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,328
He was killed by

503
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
The past on

504
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
And

505
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
The reason

506
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,080
For his execution was

507
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Because he

508
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Didn't want to

509
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,784
Say that there were

510
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
The story that were told

511
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
But if you actually look at the history

512
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
They killed him cuz he was being a dick

513
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Annoyed

514
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,000
He was a schizophrenic who would run around town

515
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,608
I like Pat agresti real life

516
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Theatrics

517
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,776
The dramas

518
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:05,664
Basically that is annoying

519
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
The Socratic method is just like

520
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,064
Constantly asking questions

521
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
People who don't like pro wrestling sound

522
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
You know it's fake

523
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
But the reason that he

524
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,792
Comes to mind is that like people

525
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,352
So you will either kill you or you can

526
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Leave town

527
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
We're going to give you a death sentence

528
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,776
Come and smuggle you away if you want to go

529
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
But the reason

530
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,600
Either way it takes care of the problem people out

531
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,392
So many of these people are just like

532
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
You know

533
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
Weather which or not

534
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
It'll solve our

535
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
I want what I need you to do and I'm sure you'll do it

536
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
People were

537
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,216
Trouble

538
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
What I want to do is lay out

539
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
Play a little bit of a context

540
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
For the world that we're living in

541
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
So we have

542
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,248
Where are all these things

543
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Take place

544
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
Know how far we have to go back but

545
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,184
Dead people who came over from

546
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,024
We're looking for Religious Freedom and choir shirt

547
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,096
They were kind of assholes

548
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
Are religion

549
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Jeffrey Lee

550
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
And also forcing a lot of people

551
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
Yeah not let anyone else do any other

552
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,056
So in the 1600s

553
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,384
People their version of religion was

554
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
Very f*****-up

555
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:46,016
In terms of the devil was a real thing

556
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
Penny Wears Prada

557
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,624
Cheap

558
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
These ideas about ghosts

559
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
And it goes down to Michigan

560
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
Are Georgia Michigan version

561
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Devil went down to Mission

562
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
The one up to Michigan

563
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Yeah you're right

564
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
When was Easter

565
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,800
Instead of the Fiddler's to turntable

566
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Maybe gold

567
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Mittal Steel

568
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
All the wheels

569
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
Pretty good

570
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,016
I want to save the KMC kru

571
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Keep right at the end

572
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,112
I'm going to look it up yeah it's so good

573
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
Devil went up to Michigan

574
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
More people having

580
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:55,648
Q60 93 is when the proper Salem Witch Trials were going on in that Hysteria

581
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
However

582
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,744
50 years before that or so

583
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
There was

584
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
A bunch of other

585
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584

Recognize generally is the first woman who was put to death

589
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288

In the Massachusetts Bay Colony

591
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
For the lady named Alice

592
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Young

593
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
47 years old

594
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
1647

595
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
In Springfield

596
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
To hang for being a witch

597
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,624
Historically

598
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Generally people

599
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
See it as a

600
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Inheritance

601
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280

602
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560

604
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
Hotel

605

Is she has no son

607

There's no one to inherit

608
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
Estate

609
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
Damn to further make that claim

610
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
I heard

611
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
Who could have inherited

612
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
Stop if she got married

613
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Tyrus

614
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,072
With probably acoustic also

615
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
Matter fact

616
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Emojis

617
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
So after that in 1648

618
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,336
48 to 1660

619
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
C3 there's a Proto witch-hunt

Is

626
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
Hilarious

627
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
What constitutes an being witches

628
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
Everything sounds like I'm so glad we live

629
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Europe

630
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Events guys like

631
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
Dammit

632
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
Witchfinder General

633
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:02,112
Cedric the Entertainer were just ask which Hunter

635
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
Emmanuel

636
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
In order to help people find witches

637
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
Course and I'm sure this is going to be real fact-based

638
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Absolutely

639
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Absolutely

640
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
This first technique that he used was

641
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
A technique called

642
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Watching

643
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Okay

644
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:26,176
Daylight with people watching and if they are actually

645
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
Within 24 hours

646
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
An imp will appear

647
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
What's an amp

648
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,624
What lake is familiarly I got like a

649
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,304
And they would show up within 24 hours because they depend on the witch

650
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Graffiti

651
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
So if it's

652
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,592
That that was ever successful

653
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,688
How many times have you come across that being the case

654
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,296
So many.

655
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,880
We would step number one this was used

656
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
The case of Margaret

657
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Her kid was like

658
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Mom

659
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm starving I want breakfast

660
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
Margaret Jones was the

661
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,080
Person who was

662
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,152
60/40 whatever

663
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:34,528
And she was found guilty and fees are the reasons that were given

664
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
Recorded

665
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
The evidence

666
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
It was against her

667
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,208
She had a malignant

668
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,304
The people that treat touch would end up getting sick

669
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
Phil Collins song

670
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
You came in contact with her.

671
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Okay we can

672
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
Very easily arduous

673
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
Communicable diseases

674
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,296

Mother worst discipline

681
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
She could tell the future

682
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
I don't believe is the truth

683
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
Something

684
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Came to pass

685
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
That you should have no knowledge of

686
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
She had upon search and apparent

687
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,672
As fresh as hell

688
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,024
Forced search it was withered

689
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Began on the opposite side of her

690
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
I don't know

691
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
She had titties

692
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Chad weird titties

693
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
I don't know

694
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,496
Okay

695
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
Watching Park

696
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Comes into play

697
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,872
In the prison in clear daylight

698
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
There was more arms

699
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,528
She's sitting on the floor and her clothes up a little child which ran from her into another room

700
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
And the officer following it

701
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Was Vanna

702
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
The like childish

703
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,696
Two other places

704
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
And one made this our Chelsea

705
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
Upon it and was cured by the said Margaret

706
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,864
Who used means to be employed

707
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
Her behavior is very and temperamental

708
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
In the like distemper she died

709
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,432
Disappeared

710
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,272
And then was cute by Margaret

711
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
Was mean in court

712
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
I mean

713
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Maybe a lot of

714
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
Yeah there's a lot of

715
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
There's a lot of stuff like that

716
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
We are

717
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,568
I think I've gotten to the bottom of water

718
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,736
Before we get to the actual Seance there's a couple of other case study that are to me

719
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,064
That we are not dealing with witchcraft pretty much ever

720
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
First case

721
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
We have basically

722
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
Heritance

723
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
Protecting inheritance

724
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,072
Gibbons

725
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
5 she was killed in

726
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
56

727
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
AM 640

728
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Tri suit

729
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Scooter overcharged

730
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
Overcharged Earth

731
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
So they called the church to investigate

732
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,832
Basically

733
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,648
Refuse to apologize

734
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,976
For the Carpenters who committed a crime against her

735
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:59,072
And crawl are

736
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:05,472
I got it

737
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
She just throw it back

738
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,848
And

739
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
Also Adam Carolla

740
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
Because she would apologize who excommunicated

741
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,464
The church accuses her of usurping her husband's Authority

742
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,024
Because of her behavior it because of suing these contractors

743
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,072
Once her husband is dead

744
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
She's tried for being a witch

745
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
So basically she was trying for

746
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
Basically

747
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:43,360
She was not conforming to social role becoming a

748
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
Is the chi was more socially connected the most

749
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
Of the other people who'd ever been accused okay

750
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,600
I feel like it's real easy to Railroad like a loner origin

751
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
You know

752
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
Make her way in the world

753
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Yes

754
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,352
In the Endocrinology be like third

755
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
Linda's produce

756
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Rode me like

757
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
I bet she was tough

758
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
I like to think she

759
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,528
Tell you about her is that her second husband

760
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
He had a

761
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
First wife before hurt

762
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Esther behling

763
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
That's the s***

764
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,472
So I

765
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,776
Was her deceased husband's first wife

766
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,336
Hester's Brother Richard Bellingham

767
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,896
Was the assistant governor of Massachusetts

768
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,968
And was instrumental in am given

769
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
Conviction of being a witch

770
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
Well okay

771
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
Your sister

772
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,672
And her husband married another lady

773
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:08,096
Kind of like a cooze and public and they got there but that's my family

774
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
To his nephew essentially otherwise

775
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
To be a team that is

776
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
Is developing a little better

777
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,920
You were talking about

778
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
In 1648

779
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,760
She's accusing fast and whipped

780
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,440
S*** out of her

781
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,520
Everybody seems like pumpkins in the story more like

782
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
Australia

783
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
The bad rap

784
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
It was a prison

785
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Like

786
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Like

787
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
Call a present

788
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:00,063
But the worst of the worst from England went over there

789
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,183
Whatever

790
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
For here

791
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Are just like

792
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
The biggest weirdo

793
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,911
Super weird

794
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,239
End of religion and Catholicism

795
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,543
If this is all were so religious and weird

796
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Do the whole separate

797
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
I think that came later

798
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,247
That was a good 80 years after all this is going on

799
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
What will find

800
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,367
When this dive down

801
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:39,487
Pretty quickly after that it becomes embarrassing

802
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,791
Yeah because I hope they back on their face

803
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,167
The distinction between Salem Village in Salem

804
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
And a lot of the other is

805
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:57,407
More intellectual centers in like she aware of what's going on for a bit

806
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:02,527
Oh I love it blew my mind

807
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
5 was

808
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
It took eight

809
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Ears

810
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
For its renewal

811
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
To get from England

812
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
To America

813
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
So for eight years

814
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,839
There wasn't a constitutionally bound Authority

815
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,959
Okay X gear and then x + 8

816
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
Alright in the meantime

817
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Governing bodies that everybody

818
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,359
Question their authenticity Lord of the Flies

819
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:32,223
A little bit his is a little more structured but yet

820
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
From the authority to the

821
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Call Anita

822
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
Could take months

823
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
To get from the news

824
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,439
The Philadelphia

825
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
They're killing people with

826
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Rocks

827
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,279
This matching some guy is gay

828
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
You're not going to believe what

829
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
F*** now

830
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
They're blaming women for being witches

831
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Disney collector

832
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,359
Mary Johnson

833
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,223
She was into the devil

834
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
She killed a child

835
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:12,927
Sushi Chicago

836
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
She ever killed child

837
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:27,519
Most likely by Nathaniel rusko who's the guy

838
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,335
Image of like

839
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,943
They're not really taking a lot of power

840
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
The jail

841
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
Cowabunga f**** lady prisoners

842
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:46,207
This is the sort of witch-hunt stuff that have been going on before

843
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,815
So there is a context where and they believe in the devil but at the same time

844
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,631
It's very rarely like a this evil person needs

845
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
Replenished

846
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
There's there's an agenda

847
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,751
Alfred

848
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
Can do a little investigative work like

849
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
If we were their defense

850
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
We were there

851
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Be like

852
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:15,135
I think we got a case

853
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,231
Yeah we were a country

854
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,679
Joseph Granville religious

855
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Are the types

856
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,799
Who believed in this like watching kind of test

857
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,615
And these are things that they believe that they can prove he exists

858
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:42,015
Sense of the Supernatural cast Glenn Beck Rush Limbaugh 100% yes yes

859
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,831
Alex Jones

860
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
He's very religious

861
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Malibu

862
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
Glenn Beck still feels more right

863
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,815
Supposed crying.

864
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Over there

865
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,911
This brings us to the proper beginning in 14

866
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,959
1692

867
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
February

868
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,543
Were the Salem witch trial proper kicks

869
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
About to try

870
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:12,479
I just feel like these women were railroad and there was no right answer and it was either like

871
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
Admit you're a witch okay you're a witch

872
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
We still think you're wet

873
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Started

874
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,511
A Scarlet Letter

875
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,839
Actually

876
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
Inspiration

877
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
I don't

878
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
Nathaniel Hawthorne

879
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Scarlet Letter

880
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Alright so

881
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
This is so much

882
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
Information

883
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,551
69th Terrace

884
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
Because the

885
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:55,487
An ordained minister had a mature ministers

886
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Kind of liked it

887
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,583
Controversial

888
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,423
This Reverend Eli Capistrano open mic comedy club coming sound effect

889
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Be perfect

890
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:09,311
About it

891
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,871
Yeah I mean I know that we have no chance of growth

892
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
Yeah we're having a better time

893
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
I think history would dictate that

894
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,087
Comedy Club coming to town was a bad idea

895
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,391
Metaphorically speaking in Salem

896
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
Okay so Samuel Perez Comes To Town

897
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,767
And down in the middle of what

898
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,095
You could almost look at as a Hatfields and McCoys

899
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,167
Type battle between two families

900
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Bensalem

901
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
The Putnams and the porter

902
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Okay

903
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Okay

904
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
Well you know the Hatfields and The McCoys

905
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
Never heard of

906
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,223
I so can come by her generosity,

907
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
He comes to town

908
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,927
And he's like it in the lay-of-the-land what was going on and he's kind of pinion

909
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,975
If you look at the record that

910
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
No matter what happens

911
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,351
The trials kicked off he was quoted as saying

912
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:12,543
Yeah it's almost

913
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Phuc yea

914
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Display

915
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
Keep it is best sort of think

916
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:23,039
I don't know it's hard to judge a person in hindsight but it seems like

917
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Avoid

918
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,599
The town split

919
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
But he's very

920
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
So

921
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,207
His daughter Betty

922
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
Abigail Williams

923
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,863
In February of 62 start to act really weird

924
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,399
They start to have seizures

925
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,727
They start to have tourettes

926
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:48,383
Start yelling at inappropriate times interrupting church sermons and stuff like that

927
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
And started

928
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,319
Flailing their arms and like

929
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
Bucked up

930
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
Bad news

931
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Nice I like that

932
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,559
Start acting all f***** up

933
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,959
Pretty quickly a bunch of kids in town start acting really f***** up in similar ways

934
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,263
Which as we know from being kids

935
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
Annoying kid

936
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
A lot of that could just be copycat

937
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,711
If you see someone you'll b******* in church b******* in church

938
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
Yeah it's so fun

939
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
You realize that like

940
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,231
I can get away with doing the things that are

941
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Or

942
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
There's just that power

943
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,727
People start being like well we got to figure out what's going on

944
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
That is

945
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Is very mad

946
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,919
He believes that there's a conspiracy involving the devil

947
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:58,783
Especially because he's also a preacher in the idea of sermons getting interrupted is very that's

948
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,415
Hostetter

949
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:10,815
Dealing with hecklers I try to avoid

950
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,935
YouTube John Putnam crushes girl yelling outfit in church

951
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
Did you just get a video.

952
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,799
Call man so people start

953
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,591
You get the idea like I we got to figure out what

954
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Not the fun way

955
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
But also their 9 and 12

956
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
Get that out of your head

957
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,391
Probably trust kids to

958
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
Weird

959
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:41,535
So the three of them accused three women

960
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:48,191
The three women who were first accused Sarah good

961
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,983
She is a homeless beggar

962
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Because

963
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:58,687
Choosing is rejecting fear and ideas of self-control

964
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
Because

965
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,063
Didn't help lead kids on a path to Salvation

966
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
What your kin goes back to the Socrates

967
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
So she wasn't funny

968
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:17,631
Homeless and a beggar

969
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Didn't help kids

970
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Okay

971
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,263
There's no like there's no corrupting influences like

972
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,079
You're saying bulshit

973
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
The ornithologist

974
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,271
The righteous path

975
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,831
Meanwhile As We Know

976
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,439
Whoever was murdered was the coolest

977
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Hero

978
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,583
Osborne

979
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
Sarah

980
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,911
Yeah

981
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,775
Sedona

982
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,871
Shining

983
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:03,455
Socially was the cheated married

984
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:09,343
Error husband Paterson but marrying the indentured servant

985
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
Jeopardize

986
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
The Inheritance

987
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
Again

988
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,695
People really don't like that

989
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
Also

990
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
You can really do

991
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
To make sure the government eminent domain

992
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,263
To make matters worse

993
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
The Sun

994
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,335
Who could theoretically

995
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,383
Get cut out of the inheritance by this marriage

996
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,711
The nephew of John Putnam scene

997
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,295
One of the members of the

998
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Cool

999
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:45,695
Demand the third woman who is Accused with

1000
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,519
Associated with African roots

1001
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
Some of India

1002
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,407
But she would tell Abigail and Betty

1003
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,967
He's fascinating stories that bordered on Vudu

1004
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,855
Convicted of inflaming their imaginations

1005
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,623
So she's guilty

1006
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,695
Yeah it's probably have a little drink or smoke

1007
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,167
You've got the homeless beggar

1008
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
It's probably pretty cool

1009
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:35,359
Social conventions in married an indentured servant which is awesome

1010
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
Lose your mind

1011
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,735
Yes

1012
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
Middle name

1013
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,599
He don't yet I have no idea that Raven

1014
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,231
School Stories

1015
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
I could just imagine

1016
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
So

1017
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
One of the other reasons

1018
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
I think I might just hit my hand

1019
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:14,271
All right one of the other accusers besides Abigail Williams

1020
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,063
Was a junior

1021
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Early on

1022
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Was fingering the

1023
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
People

1024
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
That

1025
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,767
Some of them

1026
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,143
I'm fine I know I'm an adult

1027
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,471
You been on a lineup

1028
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,031
Singers

1029
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,311
Viewing Freddy

1030
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,991
Call are very like a lot of them seem to have weird

1031
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Like the people who are being

1032
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
Sarah Osborne

1033
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,159
It had been sued by

1034
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
John Putnam

1035
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
I'm senior in the past

1036
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,231
Overland

1037
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:00,095
Pop had been sued in the past

1038
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,119
Or it had

1039
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
Beefs

1040
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,727
With the Putnam family

1041
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,823
All I want to do this comes up and it's very suspicious

1042
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,919
Abigail Williams

1043
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Third person

1044
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,711
Who's making accusations

1045
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
Is

1046
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
A member of the Putnam family

1047
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,087
A twelve-year-old child in the Putnam family

1048
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
Go back in time

1049
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:31,071
Now I'm just a comedian

1050
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,935
I don't know about your small-town agricultural Justice

1051
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,983
I feel like the other money

1052
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,175
Also what I would do

1053
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:54,367
Come at me bro styles

1054
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,415
Come at me bro

1055
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
CT impression

1056
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,815
Mycourtcase

1057
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,911
Get accused then

1058
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,703
Get out of here

1059
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:15,103
Like the three of them kind of getting accused well alright

1060
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,967
More the next person is Accused is Martha Corey

1061
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,759
And She's accused

1062
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:25,343
Because she publicly expressed skepticism about the girls accusation

1063
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,207
Okay president

1064
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
You're going down

1065
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,119
Rebecca nurse

1066
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,423
Are both upstanding citizen

1067
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:44,031
Cool then become accused of being witches

1068
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
They aren't homeless

1069
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,335
Start

1070
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,663
To fuel this idea that it can be anybody anybody can be a witch

1071
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Not just

1072
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,783
Porsche people anybody can be at so we all have to accuse each other

1073
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,319
Yeah it's like

1074
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,623
How do I know you're not

1075
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,671
That there was a joke

1076
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:04,255
Type character during the time making lots of which jokes

1077
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,399
Killed so fast which one of you ladies wants to go out

1078
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,471
The next person who's this is where

1079
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,359
In the resurgent this is where my mind broke

1080
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,663
Okay

1081
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Is Dorothy good

1082
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:28,319
Who is the daughter Sarah good the homeless beggar lady years old

1083
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Now she's not

1084
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,647
Convicted of being a witch

1085
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,071
But then also it might be thing word

1086
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,143
I don't know a whole lot about her history

1087
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
From tragedy in

1088
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,495
Was recently almost lost her Lander

1089
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,055
Maybe the Putnam took her lantai noise

1090
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
So

1091
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,663
She wasn't convicted but she was interrogated

1092
00:57:53,919 --> 00:58:00,063
And the answer is yes

1093
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,831
Judges

1094
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,879
Was used to implicate her mother

1095
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
Which is nuts

1096
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,743
Questions

00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,415
No there's no specifics but her testimony

00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,119

1110
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Convicted

1111
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,287
Ended up being killed

You're basically there's a lot of people who get mixed up in it

1141
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:27,775
But a lot of it is just like our side into prison

01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
Wow

There's no doubt

1148
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
So

1149
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,071
At this point

1150
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,631
The accusations become too numerous to list

1151
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,935
And things just spiral out of control again

1152
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
It's like

1153
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,615
And it has got to be knobs.

1154
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
I'd like to think

1155
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
They were staying

1156
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,295
I think the most of the same people laugh

1157
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,343
Jermaine

1158
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:22,047
I think Reverend Burroughs

1159
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Spell differently

1160
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,703
But

1161
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,031
He was involved like being Jewish around these

1162
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,151
If you think they're doing

1163
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
24-hour

1164
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:40,991
Hornswoggle

1165
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
You dangle a bar of gold

1166
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,719
At the beginning you had a bunch of people who were super related to the Putnam Porter

1167
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
The family

1168
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,583
Everything loses control

1169
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,399
And a bunch of people who aren't involved at all get accused

1170
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:03,007
And I think appearances here

1171
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:09,407
So we have to pretend but the things that we were doing before we're real

1172
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,711
Arthur J

1173
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:19,135
40 people

1174
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
I wonder why

1175
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,999
Yeah

1176
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,047
I'm sleep a lot of them are killed

1177
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
They can do that

1178
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,631
Chirp

1179
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
I don't

1180
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,727
Imprisoned

1181
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,847
I'm going back to the Jedi

1182
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,687
What are authorized in German

1183
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,159
So they were just hang up

1184
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
Shallow Grave

1185
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,327
And then generally what would happen is the families would come

1186
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,119
And bring them back to their home

1187
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,239
That's usually

1188
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,799
Was caught up in the end it believe they're witches

1189
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
The shallow grave

1190
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
Is really f***** up stuff

1191
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
Type of this

1192
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:20,063
If you take the human tragedy out of it and I'll just like sadness

1193
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
People dying

1194
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,903
Brooks movie here somewhere

1195
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
Is a comedy of dumbass

1196
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Okay

1197
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,791
Because in court they're legitimately arguing

1198
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,095
Where did Manhattan lawyer

1199
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:37,215
Whether or not a person has to give the devil permission

1200
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
To use their face

1201
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Do torment

1202
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,567
Because

1203
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
These kids

1204
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
Are saying

1205
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
That like

1206
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
Sarah Goode

1207
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,831
It was a shade of you it was an apparition

1208
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,879
The devil was using your form

1209
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
Lawyers are arguing

1210
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,047
Permission

1211
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,631
At one point

1212
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:14,335
It's so like that is very bizarre

1213
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,359
How funny

1214
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,663
Remember from my previous study

1215
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,455
Someone wants to

1216
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
Fidelis to ask

1217
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
The devil tried to overthrow God

1218
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
But your permission

1219
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,439
What the f*** religion worship

1220
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:34,303
Religious my favorite

1221
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:42,751
Do they do there's one of those things that using Court where is like if

1222
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:46,591
Having seizures and stuff like that

1223
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,151
Crutches the person and they are healed

1224
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,431
That proves their witch

1225
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
Because

1226
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,551
They believe that whatever illness I caused you I can

1227
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Secure

1228
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
Because

1229
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,415
Venomous evil comes out of my eyes

1230
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:06,303
And when I talked to truly flows back into my body would almost think that at that point

1231
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
They would almost

1232
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607
I'll try to

1233
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,399
Weaponized

1234
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
Or use them as

1235
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Healers

1236
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,031
Well they can only heal that which they cause

1237
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:20,383
Okay just in case

1238
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,431
I totally understand

1239
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Especially

1240
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:30,367
They hate these Native Americans so much instead of blankets giving these women

1241
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,415
I'm very curious to see

1242
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,695
First of all I have no doubt

1243
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Like Wally World

1244
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,791
I would assume there was some of that

1245
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:43,679
But outside

1246
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
I'm going to give her a king-size

1247
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,775
Like I'm going to have sex with her

1248
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,871
If it might be stretched

1249
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,431
She's a witch

1250
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,735
It does seem like

1251
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,319
Stop is as bad as that but not that

1252
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,647
Formalized into

1253
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,951
Apple stuff

1254
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
Yes I would almost

1255
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
Guarantee

1256
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
One awful

1257
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,607
Not really all that awful B really f****** stupid

1258
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,143
Is the thing called The Witch

1259
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,935
Which cake are you aware of the witch cave

1260
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,215
No but it sounds delicious

1261
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
It's not

1262
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,311
Ate something that they used in court as a method

1263
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
To like trying

1264
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,407
Define delicious piece of cake in front of

1265
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,455
Newegg

1266
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
But you wish that was what they did

1267
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,599
So what they did was make a cake out of

1268
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
And

1269
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,951
The urine of the children that were Bewitched

1270
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,767
So these kids with p and make a cake

1271
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
Campus

1272
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
Repeat it to a dog

1273
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,399
Now their belief was

1274
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,447
The one the dog eats potato

1275
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,727
It will hurt

1276
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:55,359
So you would hear the screams of the witch when the cake is being eaten

1277
01:06:55,615 --> 01:07:01,759
Because some sort of the evil is carried through the children's urine or something like that it's super

1278
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
I was rid of time machine

1279
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,511
And we brought one of the guys back and

1280
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
But hear me out

1281
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
Explained

1282
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
First of all weird to be here in your seat

1283
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Future

1284
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,639
Second of all

1285
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,431
What do you know about

1286
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:34,527
Michelle I want witch cakes

1287
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,087
If you follow my thoughts

1288
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
It's it's

1289
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Stay

1290
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:43,999
If you look at all the scholarly sources tonight

1291
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,791
Full of books about

1292
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
Urine of the child

1293
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
Conduit

1294
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
Make sense

1295
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,031
So they

1296
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,615
Do you have to think that the possibility

1297
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,879
I can't imagine this ever gave concrete evidence

1298
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
To like

1299
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,071
Dumped by my cavity brain also

1300
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
If you want to go

1301
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,167
Imagine the test that didn't get approved

1302
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,567
My forklift

1303
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,759
Afterwards if she's not a witch then get a proper

1304
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:42,879
Well realizer in

1305
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,927
Influence is gone

1306
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
Or you say

1307
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
Evil spirits

1308
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
Got to her

1309
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,047
Tricked out concerto

1310
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
Play learn

1311
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,655
So about 2

1312
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
The end of the relevant information

1313
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,239
Which sucks because I was so much fun

1314
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,775
Information who is the president

1315
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
There wasn't

1316
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,663
Oh I'm sorry I'm sorry for the revolution

1317
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:12,063
I'm sorry

1318
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,159
Who's the president information getting from England

1319
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,951
The Colony took eight years or so

1320
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:23,327
Get their King has no idea about what's going on here

1321
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:29,215
I know imagine this is over and like 7 years later

1322
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:40,479
What the f*** were they doing over there America's at the big game of grab ass

1323
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,295
If you think about it the revolution

1324
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
Start

1325
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,879
60 years after that there now

1326
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
There might be an element of it

1327
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
Kingwood

1328
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
Maybe we can fly to the revolution because it's like the yeah we got to keep up a little bit of appearance

1329
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
Justin likes

1330
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
Is it worth it

1331
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,983
The taxes were bringing in really

1332
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,263
These jerks

1333
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
Maybe America is

1334
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,079
The dumbest of the dumb

1335
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,639
Pretty conceivable

1336
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:12,479
Guess what

1337
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
Hey witch catcher

1338
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,527
Forgot your pit cakes

1339
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
The f*** out of here

1340
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,087
Yeah

1341
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
20 people X

1342
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
Executed

1343
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
5 died in prison

1344
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,231
Two of them little babies

1345
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
Singing prison

1346
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
You also have to wonder

1347
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
Property

1348
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
Yep power

1349
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,335
Money that still is pulled

1350
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
Old now we're talkin

1351
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
Money

1352
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,527
Free land land up

1353
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
For grabbing

1354
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,087
Everything's moving so fast

1355
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,583
Power such an ability

1356
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,167
So there's a lot of theories into in terms of like what was going on

1357
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:06,751
One of the ones that's really popular among people as those other got poisoning

1358
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,287
In the Rye

1359
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
In the city

1360
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,343
Claviceps

1361
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,415
Do the precursor for LSD

1362
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,975
So a lot of people believe that the

1363
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,255
Going to town was infected

1364
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,303
The falls

1365
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,375
But that doesn't explain why a lot of freaking out

1366
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Not entirely sure

1367
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
Sleep paralysis is another explanation

1368
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,519
Infer why kids that have terrifying visions of

1369
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
The people

1370
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,847
Maybe you're a kid and you run into a homeless beggar

1371
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,687
That can be scary just in the affected like

1372
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,711
Sure an adult

1373
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Shouldn't they be not

1374
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,343
Yeah

1375
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,623
You see that person

1376
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,647
In your head

1377
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,439
I'd say what growing up

1378
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
Indiana

1379
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
The Greeks

1380
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Kali merah

1381
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
But

1382
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
The

1383
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
They had like

1384
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,751
The grandmother live

1385
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,943
Course

1386
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,295
Kalispera

1387
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
We didn't like her

1388
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:30,975
Oh no no malaka

1389
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
Carrizo

1390
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:32,767
Oh yeah

1391
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
Malakas

1392
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:37,887
The bad person

1393
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,655
Okay

1394
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:44,543
I don't think I had a work for f*****.

1395
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,311
Evil

1396
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,359
Call Ed Perth

1397
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,383
We are

1398
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:52,991
We doing the backyard freaking out like that

1399
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,039
Sleep paralysis at work

1400
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
Sure my speaker

1401
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:59,135
There's a huge phenomenon of people seeing an old hag

1402
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,671
Call old hags

1403
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
Syndrome

1404
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:04,511
Sleep paralysis and when they come to the hallucinate

1405
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,303
Old woman sitting on their chest

1406
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,351
This is just something that is

1407
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,399
Super bizarre but it does happen

1408
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,447
That's pretty good

1409
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,775
Explanation

1410
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,335
I don't know which way they're boner

1411
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
There's another instant

1412
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,735
Leave the round the time there was an outbreak of

1413
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,551
Bird born encephalitis

1414
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:32,159
Which is a bird carry disease that causes paralysis catatonia

1415
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
Nocturnal

1416
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,999
Not emission emission nope

1417
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,839
Just nocturnality baseball your sleep schedule

1418
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:46,239
Do you have delayed responses to physical and mental stimulus

1419
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,823
My girlfriend's I think would have been considered

1420
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
I can't sleep

1421
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,919
So at the end of it

1422
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,223
I am hundred percent convinced

1423
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,551
That the beginning of it had to do with the porter Putnam

1424
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,599
The two families

1425
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,647
Yeah when you look into them

1426
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,183
The reason

1427
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,231
Loggerhead

1428
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
Was

1429
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
That

1430
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,815
The Putnam family wanted

1431
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
To stay into the app

1432
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
Cultural part of the city

1433
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,703
That's what they were more invested in

1434
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,263
Thomas from salemtowne

1435
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:23,103
The Porter Family saw more promising

1436
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
In progress and the future

1437
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Salemtowne

1438
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,431
Involved in

1439
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,991
And they wanted to be absorbed into salemtowne

1440
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,807
The two families had f******

1441
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,343
It's not like

1442
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
You don't like it

1443
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,135
Someone

1444
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,671
Nowadays near the feud with them

1445
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
Back then

1446
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,743
People who weren't part of their family

1447
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
Would be out drinking

1448
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
Uba uba

1449
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,167
We're sitting here having a beer everything is fine

1450
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
Then

1451
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,983
All of a sudden we're fighting

1452
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,263
Psych player Hogan fans

1453
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
Craigslist

1454
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:57,407
Unrelated parties get involved in the feud

1455
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
Two families philosophy

1456
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,223
It's kind of like bricks

1457
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,807
A little bit in terms of like there's actually leaves Allentown

1458
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,343
Or so to be absorbed into Salem

1459
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,903
Really hot feeling

1460
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
About it

1461
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,695
So

1462
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:15,583
The Reverend Parris becomes Town can't figure out how to solve

1463
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,655
Is more involved

1464
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,935
And the pot

1465
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
Numb side

1466
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
The autonomy side

1467
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
4 Salem

1468
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,799
In addition to that

1469
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
Well

1470
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,639
Here's why it's such b*******

1471
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,455
He's involved with the Putnam side of the philosophy

1472
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,783
His daughter and niece are the first two people

1473
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,063
Who make accusations

1474
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,367
Along with an Putnam Junior

1475
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:43,487
Three people to start making accusations on the Putnam side

1476
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
Or people that the

1477
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
Land disputes with

1478
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
The Putnams

1479
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,287
You just do people constantly being involved

1480
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
What are you do

1481
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,103
If you come to town

1482
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,431
Specifically

1483
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
The land.

1484
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Churches on

1485
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,951
Savannah's pretty good amount

1486
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
You got to fix this

1487
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
What are you doing

1488
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,559
Absolutely

1489
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
Which is siding with these manipulative

1490
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,543
I don't know I mean if you truly believe the Salem should be autonomous from the other Salem

1491
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,847
I don't know what to do

1492
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
Big crew

1493
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
Big strong

1494
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Big stromboli

1495

It really drives me f******

1504
01:16:55,167 --> 01:17:00,543
Just to give you a couple of platinum family members

01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,359
Senior also to use a bunch of people

01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
Adventurist

1512
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,159
Hannah Putnam

1513
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,975
Made a bunch of accusations at blame

1514
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:22,303
For being a witch and killing her eight-year-old child

1515
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,095
Probably sit also backpack

1516
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,631
Kids at table.

1517
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:30,239
Is the biggest dick in the world

01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,055
He's the one who sued bunch of people who all

That Reverend Burroughs that I mentioned earlier

1521
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,247
Reverend Burroughs gets out of town

1522
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,551
Cuz he didn't like the way things were going

1523

Seniors

1524
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:49,439
Yeah

1525
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,231
Everything alright I'll come back

1526
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:56,095
But the two of them.

1527
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,423
Them still don't get along the 15 years later you like

1528
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
Talking to the witch

1529
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,983
Saint Ambrose

1530
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
The ends up being

1531
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:09,151
Yeah

1532
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,479
This dispute it becomes

1533
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,671
Beyond that you do have to wrestle with the fact that it's so against women

1534
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
Kylee Russell

1535
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,999
Welcome.

1536
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,791
Sorry

1537
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,863
Button

1538
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,167
That's not an irrelevant piece of

1539
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
Yeah I think

1540
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,055
For the little too

1541
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Baldi for the

1542
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:43,199
That time

1543
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Survey

1544
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,527
Claiming her own land

1545
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
Church

1546
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,575
Standing up again

1547
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:54,975
Putnam John Putnam Senior as well

1548
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
Threatening

1549
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
I got a lot a lot of it

1550
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,215
Instead of the Salem witch trials

1551
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,751
These might have been called the tailor

1552
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:12,127
The Salem witch trials

1553
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:18,527
We have to wonder to how many like I wouldn't be super surprises

1554
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,575
Were people who rejected men

1555
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:25,695
I would not be at all if some of that was the real reason

1556
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
I mean

1557
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,607
Is there anything you read that were like

1558
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,007
How real is that

1559
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,823
They're also

1560
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,639
Holistic healing

1561
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,431
Now there were those three ladies

1562
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,759
I can't remember I'm trying to come up with

1563
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:54,111
The salt pepper and Spinderella

1564
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,391
Britches

1565
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,671
Microsoft

1566
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,231
I do today are you

1567
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:03,071
Shoot I saw them live their terrible they were terrible

1568
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:09,727
Are there were those three whose names are

1569
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,080
Really they probably just admitted it

1570
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,360
Either because I

1571
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
Hey where we real cool if we admit it

1572
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:23,040
We can blame anybody

1573
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,416
Which is

1574
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:38,144
I think a piece of it too is that like some of these people were on the lower end of society

1575
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,192
I maybe like to drink at night

1576
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,080
Accrue

1577
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
The pleasure

1578
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:52,224
And my Rhymes are a good shop

1579
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,504
Oh really

1580
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Did you welcome people to it

1581
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,600
To bring you in here

1582
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,392
Van Halen

1583
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
Are there is

1584
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
Steven is they wanted to be

1585
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:10,144
Marty what's your what's your feeling on all this

1586
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
It away

1587
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
It does kind of make

1588
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
Acme

1589
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,360
I love hate really

1590
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
Our government

1591
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,176
Tyranitar

1592
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
It does

1593
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
Make me

1594
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
Think like you know

1595
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,088
We kind of do need

1596
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
Somebody in charge

1597
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
To be like what the

1598
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
F*** are you gay

1599
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,000
All of us don't do it someone,

1600
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:36,768
Now

1601
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
At the other hand it's like

1602
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,840
Yep this is what we do

1603
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
There are

1604
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,448
The Salem Witch Trials nowadays

1605
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,264
But there are

1606
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,408
11 weeks

1607
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
Now with

1608
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Eastern Arizona

1609
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,136
That's kind of fueling a lot of the

1610
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,952
The reason for that

1611
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:07,744
Very easy

1612
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,512
Easy also

1613
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792
2

1614
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:11,840
Is one thing

1615
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
To push another

1616
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,912
Nazis did it to

1617
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
Best of

1618
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,752
Charge will take

1619
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,664
But

1620
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
Power

1621
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,224
Like real cool dude

1622
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,808
Take care of a problem but create

1623
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:35,648
Absolutely Bush Administration

1624
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Sure

1625
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:43,584
Another 9/11

1626
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,352
Someone was

1627
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:48,960
Yeah I mean it's just one of those things where it's like

1628
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,008
You look back in history

1629
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,568
Time ago

1630
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
Black Widow video

1631
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,992
Listen to the things like that

1632
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,832
Situation where guy came up to her and was like

1633
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,368
You should have my babies

1634
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:13,280
And she was like No I don't want

1635
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:21,984
Absolutely there is an entitlement there is a like I deserve

1636
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,592
I think a hundred years from now hopefully will be back on that if you like

1637
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,872
I can't believe

1638
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,200
This is Heidi didn't rise up as a whole and erratic

1639
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,224
Quicker

1640
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,600
Mental illness is still a thing

1641
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
We don't fight

1642
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,392
Understand

1643
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
Comprehend

1644
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,976
Madeline says

1645
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,280
I had some mental illness

1646
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,328
Factors

1647
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:50,144
And just by going to the woman on the train saying have my babies

1648
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
Probably

1649
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,216
What's the mental illness

1650
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,800
Absolutely crazy but

1651
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,176
People are crazy

1652
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
Ignore or diminish

1653
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,016
The anti-women acid rain

1654
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,648
Evil in this Witch Trials map of like

1655
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,952
Either fear of women or hatred

1656
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,000
And that

1657
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,560
Bed of amplifier

1658
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,376
There's no power here

1659
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:31,616
And absolute power and no oversight being ignored

1660
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,920
Three some sort of like track

1661
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:40,064
I agree I think all that is true and then also I think

1662
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,344
Absolutely

1663
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,880
John Putnam Senior

1664
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,672
Maybe one of the biggest dicks

1665
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,280
I think he's responsible for 90% of this welcome to the club

1666
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:52,608
Prescott Bush

1667
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:59,264
Adolf Hitler

1668
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,568
The book controversial

1669
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
People to throw in there

1670
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,456
Bubba Bubba

1671
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,224

1672
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,504
Warhol

1673
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,808
Warhol

1674
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,832
I'm an ass-whole

1675
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,880
I'm going to go and throw h.h. Holmes

1676
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,184
Sure sure actual serial killer

1677
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,744
And I'm Night Shyamalan because of the village

1678
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:26,400
I think we found some truth here I think we have I like the first time

1679
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:32,800
You could argue that

1680
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:35,104
Women had to die

1681
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,432
For this episode common thread

1682
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,224
But it also

1683
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
Sheds another

1684
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,320
China Delights OdoBan

1685

White magic

1686
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,720
Just sometimes women are not true

1687
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
And hopefully

1688
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,072
Like it just to me as though if there would have been like

1689
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,376
Warlock

1690
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,400
Trials or something

1691
01:25:59,424 --> 01:25:59,936
Men wear

1692
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,008
I mean

1693
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
It's a

1694
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:05,824
It's one of those things

1695
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,784
Yeah well I mean

1696
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,816
Slavery

1697
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:29,376
It's like one of those like

1698
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,168
Where can I get soup

1699
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:35,776
With WTF WTF podcast

1700
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,336
Witch trials

1701
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:42,688
You want people to pee in a cakewalk

1702
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,968
If there are any

1703
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,528
Salem witch trial apology

1704
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,576
Probably

1705
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,600
I'm

1706
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,136

01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:55,488
I would also like that person on the vodka

1708
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
Let me explain my point of view

1709
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
Yeah

1710
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,312
Repeat that

1711
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,616
Spectral evidence

1712
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
