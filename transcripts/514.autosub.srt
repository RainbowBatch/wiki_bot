1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
And Jordan wedding

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
I need money

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,464
Everybody

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,048
Looks around technology Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

8
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,352
Did we are.

9
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
Quest what's up

10
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,240
Actually told you about already and I'd like to

11
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
To continue my celebration of this

12
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:21,152
And that is rold gold put out a flavor of pretzels

13
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,224
Two different

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Limited-time flavors Buffalo and I dare not try

15
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
Call Yaya

16
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
Of course not but the Savory butter

17
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
I tried that

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
He's so good

19
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
It's okay it's

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
So good is it like butter

21
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,816
Popcorn like that feeling where you get

22
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,912
So much better on that okay

23
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
To get your reaction

24
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
So good

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
It's like real it's like a it's a harsh butter

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
It's a lot of butter

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
It is a lot of butter

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,248
It is maybe too much butter for me but it is it good

29
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
That's good I have eaten half of one and I am

30
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
Full you're very very heavy I expected it to be like a almost non-existent flavor

31
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,048
Little suggestion of butter or something

32
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
But now I'd say it's in your face

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Yeah well done rolled gold

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,496
Know when we were talking about this I was like oh this sounds like a flavor blasted goldfish yeah

35
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
Good that is exactly what it taste like it tastes like a regular old gold

36
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
The pretzel and then they were like

37
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
What if we just

38
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
Hubbard it we just

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,064
Photos

40
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:37,696
My bright spot this Thursday is actually the original Final Fantasy

41
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,816
No I'm Christmas they had like a half off special so it's like five bucks

42
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Sounds like screwing

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
And I started playing it again

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
And I am so happy

45
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
And I'm happy that I did ask

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
Do the Remake 2

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,568
Is because once I got out of midgar

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
I felt

49
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
The same way I did the first time I played it which was just

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,968
Thank Christ I'm out of that funk

51
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
Checking place yeah that's you know the feeling I guess the game

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
I want you to feel

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,136
I totally it the moment you leave midgar and you can

54
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,464
Can see the entire world in front of you and it shows you the world

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,792
Oh my God I thought it was all going to be in midgard like remake is great

56
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
It's really what it's all about

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
Inmate escape

58
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
It's just amazing

59
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Really is beautiful

60
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,800
You make a strong case for me to give the game a shot

61
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
And I met a major

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
It really is just

63
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,224
Second grade definitely a big pretty much all of the finals

64
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
T-Series

65
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,624
Except for the Remake what you made me play a night

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Well

67
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
I'm glad you're enjoying that

68
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Rap-up

69
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Figure for you

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
I'm going to

71
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
I hope everyone

72
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Then I will celebrate

73
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
It's Christmas at a nice Christmas everybody celebrates other

74
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336
Holidays are great holiday time or if you just

75
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
Don't celebrate

76
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,808
I felt it would be emotionally draining for us an episode on Friday

77
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
That was covering

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
What Alex

79
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
It was doing

80
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Not taking his week off but he said he was going to text

81
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,399
Not having a fun time

82
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Surprising I didn't watch

83
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,543
All of his firing everybody made it very hard for me to take a day off

84
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,615
My only friend is very

85
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
I thought they'd be a little bit of shot

86
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,831
Freud in it I think there would be a little bit of us wallowing around in the mud watching the guy being miserable

87
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,951
I mean there's some fun too that we like watching Alex be miserable no but we did that already

88
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,815
That's true first American Turtle episode

89
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,167
Felt almost repetitive and not like it was going to bring anything new to the table

90
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Dan's I worried that once we came to Monday what would we have to cover like maybe there be a Project Camelot

91
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
What episode we could have done for Friday

92
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
But if Alex actually had taken that week off

93
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
We need that for Monday or whatever

94
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
I left me kind of an alert

95
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
Search of what to do answer again I took that break

96
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Here we are back on Monday

97
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,791
Slightly different episodes we're just covering a special report that Alex put out

98
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
And it's Christmas

99
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
There's Hatchet throwing that's implied

100
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,663
Hatchet throwing

101
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
We're going to

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,015
To be talking on this episode about Alex's immediate

103
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
Response to the bombing in Nashville

104
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,927
That's going to be okay if I take a little time

105
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Because I think

106
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
It's it's

107
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Sam

108
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,815
You know it's in that vein of things that I think are really important under

109
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Understand about alley

110
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
And as we go in

111
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
220 21

112
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
My dad is going to anyone

113
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
Intuit

114
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
The demon coming through the portal

115
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
I feel like as we get into that you're one of the things I really want to

116
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,439
Stress and really run redouble my efforts on is

117
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Looking at these things that like a really

118
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
Actually important about Alex

119
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
It's always fun to make fun of him

120
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,751
Breaking down in the studio with guns

121
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,847
But those are things that are almost trivial in a certain way I think you still have a job

122
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,711
This is this is part of that just part of like

123
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Looking back at that field

124
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Thank you for the books

125
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695

132
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111

The star of the Herbie Fully Loaded Lindsay Lohan

134
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231

00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
Freakishly large

143
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,471
Thank you so much as much I say this with

144
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,311
Just saying

145
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
Website or what you could do if you are feeling like

146
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
Your generous spirit is a press

147
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Massive

148
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,671
Global Corporation literally sucking the life

149
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
From the planet then what you should do

150
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Is escape

151
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,583
From that place take your generosity to I don't know.

152
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,167
And then give it to a local charity or bail fund

153
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Specifically

154
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Sounds good

155
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
Alright then I've a special report

156
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
I did not cut anything out of the

157
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
The special report that Alex is playing except for one point where he plays the audio of the bomb going off in Nashville

158
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
He doesn't really add anything interesting to the episode

159
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
To hear an explosion and the audio makes it

160
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,767
Terrible is so loud

161
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,143
It does make me think of that Bill Cooper episode though the day after the Oklahoma City bombing

162
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
In that episode bill made a point to play the audio of the

163
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,543
Explosion of this kind of Echoes here

164
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Dramatically

165
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Built

166
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
Repeatedly

167
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,223
And kind of like almost like a chorus and then he would say something in the middle

168
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Alex pictures of Colin response

169
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Display is a it's very loud

170
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
I'm here is I've just

171
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Cut every time it's clear that Alex is doing

172
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Different take

173
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
Cuz you know what the audio shift slightly can tell that Alex

174
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Just like ran out of steam in LA

175
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Let's try example

176
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,055
Bit better than we've seen in the bathroom

177
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
Try another sentence out his wife is a better producer

178
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Ben Rob do

179
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Fishback

180
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
So here's where we start

181
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Here's the beginning

182
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Today in the early morning

183
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Hours of

184
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
A large

185
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Mom house inside an RV

186
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Exploded

187
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Outside the gates

188
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Do you make munication

189
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Warn the public to get away

190
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Before the bomb

191
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
My broadcast

192
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
The 10 minutes

193
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
There was a bomb on board the vehicle

194
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
911 all service

195
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Play me the gunshots

196
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Been fired in the area

197
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Minutes before the explosion

198
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
The FBI's not report

199
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Confounded

200
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
You can already tell

201
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
911 cut was almost

202
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Joseph Watson

203
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,007
Coming in before the breath is finished

204
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
Cut in the middle of a stream

205
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
I hate it so on Christmas day did not hear about this RV Park

206
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Downtown Nashville

207
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
Have the time of our recording one of the working theory is that people have is it is possible that the person was targeting AT&T building

208
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,463
Which show was quite nearby the blast site

209
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
This as a possible motive for an actor

210
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Domestic Terror makes

211
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Complete set

212
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
If you were going to go through the trouble of carrying out a bombing

213
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
You'd likely want whatever damage you do to have mac

214
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Maximum Impact

215
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,871
AT&T is operations in Nashville are housed at that building so the potential disruption you could cause by damaging that would be huge

216
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Have we seen from The Fallout of the bombing itself

217
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,271
With some people still being without phone service today as we're recording

218
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Pennsylvania

219
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
Tragic turn of events in my heart goes out to the people effect

220
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Acted by this act

221
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,767
Civilian casualties and human remains that were found there

222
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,071
Literally right before we started recording

223
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
I saw it was being reported that they have match

224
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
The DNA

225
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:57,823
There's a lot of stuff that's on my own still about this event but there are definitely some Fair assumptions you can make about it

226
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Obviously

227
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
This wasn't the next

228
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
So there wasn't intention

229
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
He was clearly meant to be aspects

230
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Given that it was playing for

231
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
This morning

232
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Very solemn time for many in this country

233
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,695
My gut tells me based on these pieces of information

234
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
That this was an ideological a

235
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
Who knows what that ideology is at this point

236
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,911
Right I mean it's unfortunate

237
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
That's the vibe I'm getting

238
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
From this whole thing is a Vietnamese

239
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,615
Vietnamese monk self emulating but because they believe

240
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Beds

241
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,479
They allow oceans are going to sneak in through the Earth

242
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Where's like

243
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Yes

244
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
You are making a steak

245
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
The problem

246
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
This isn't it

247
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
I'm not sure I quite

248
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
Follow what you're saying she isn't going to hurt anyone

249
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
Making an assumption here

250
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
You did that but that's the general

251
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
Feeling that people are are some pee passing around waiting on that delineate here

252
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
He's the idea of like what is

253
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575
Responsible speculation and what is not

254
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,207
Speculating that this was motivated by some sort of an ideology based on the actions

255
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
The circle

256
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Stances

257
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
Irresponsible speculation

258
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
Claiming that you know exactly what it is

259
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
Or choosing what

260
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
You know you want the target

261
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,775
You think it might have been ashore then like why would they do that

262
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
That's not

263
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Like Gray

264
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
That's not grounded

265
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
And I think that you know

266
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
It's

267
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,015
I I see I see that possibility like yeah sure

268
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
It could turn out more information comes out and he wants someone who's worried about 5G

269
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,511
Making a claim that that's what's going

270
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
By any means but

271
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
From what I understand so far

272
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
It does have that

273
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Feeling of somebody who is

274
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
I guess sacrificing their own life for something they believe in

275
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
And chances are

276
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
Going after AT&T

277
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
Impact that a little bit more you're still making the giant something

278
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Don't think of it

279
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
Do you know that is substantiated

280
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
104

281
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,303
Could in the future and this is the issue with the wet

282
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
Concrete you got to respect the wet concrete

283
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Until it dries

284
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Because otherwise

285
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
You just f*** it up

286
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,823
It's the point that I've made a lot in that Alex Jones knows that his business model really only works

287
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
Is powered by uncertain

288
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:45,759
The moment that the cement is wet and he can write his initials on there before it dries that is the time he knows he has to go to work

289
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,111
I naturally on Christmas Day when he's already failing to take this week off

290
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,183
You record the special report about the Nashville bombing because

291
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Awesome possibly

292
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Conscious level

293
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,535
He knows that if he waits until his show on Sunday

294
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,863
There's a chance that more details will be known by then it'll be too late run to

295
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
The prophet office

296
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
This tragedy

297
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,495
We watch this unfold in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing it seems

298
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
Kind of likely this is going to be another big push for him now

299
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
A couple of things are different though

300
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Which make the end 2020 a lot more

301
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Complicated for someone like out

302
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,063
41 their tongues people running around online competing for access

303
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
To that wet cement

304
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Alex doesn't have exclusive control over the

305
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Paranoid

306
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,535
Conspiracy space anymore so there are other people who are equally able to put their imprint on stories

307
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Before the information

308
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Public

309
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
The other major difference is the people

310
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
What's now

311
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
In the past he was a lunatic yelling but everyone just stopped and it's best to leave him alone

312
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
He went to far

313
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
I'm finally some people stood up to his bully

314
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
That had a domino effect

315
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
Pics of people not being afraid to burden him with lawsuits when he be famous them

316
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
And that is a chilling effect on someone's ability to defame people freeway

317
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
It should yeah

318
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,903
There are some limitations

319
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,975
Do you legally can speculate about without

320
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
Alex knows that you know that this is just the reality of his life meanwhile

321
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
These other people who want to get access to that wet

322
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:12,287
Cement they're mostly Anonymous weirdos online they're operating fake name to alias

323
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Qanon account

324
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,151
They don't have to worry about being sued because they're essentially internet Phantom

325
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
They are bound by the same Theory

326
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
Consequence but Alex has

327
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
So they're free to speculate and crafts

328
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
Conspiracies anyways Alex is not

329
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Used to be

330
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
Yeah and he can't direct it

331
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
He now has two if something

332
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Gets too popular

333
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
He has to assimilate it

334
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
Instead of being able to kind of

335
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
Push the narrative in any direction that he would

336
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Yeah yeah he's getting

337
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Pushed

338
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823
Well I think I think even to the pastor's even more complicated and pushing simultaneously

339
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,199
Co-opting hot online Trends and then making them

340
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,295
You know Matt's the Infowars narrative

341
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
Yeah well that's the thing

342
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
He could straddle the line

343
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Straddle the line between like the

344
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Part of the internet that nobody goes on anymore

345
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,095
And then come back to the to the real world as being that kind of

346
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Almost Bridge

347
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
Between them and now the

348
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,031
Crazy part is the main internet so that's all over all over the place

349
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,735
The reasons why I decided like if you're overdoing this episode it probably be good

350
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
You talk about Alex's media respond

351
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Because that's

352
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
The concrete wet moment

353
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
Let's see what he can do

354
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
In this new

355
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:38,047
Infowar battlespace

356
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
From when he would be able to

357
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,959
Be the king of the roost

358
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,519
And we'll have to completely different

359
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
Alex

360
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Motive

361
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Carryout

362
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Attacks

363
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Could it be a former employee

364
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Core engineer

365
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Could be an organization

366
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
A sugar group

367
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
A terrorist

368
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
AT&T for there

369
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Politics

370
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Perhaps owning

371
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
The propaganda

372
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Rest assured

373
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
These are the first

374
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Questions

375
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Asking right now

376
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
On the ground

377
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
If you notice the two possibilities that Alex provides for potential enemies with a motive seemed to imply that

378
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
He's sympathetic to the bomb

379
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
Mediately

380
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,159
Maybe it's someone who's everybody

381
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,743
But that's weird that it's really weird

382
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
See it

383
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
All the reasons I'm not saying I'm not saying goes with the same Glee

384
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,007
Here are the reasons that I would bother you

385
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,335
That's that's the feeling

386
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
Wait what

387
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Weird

388
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:08,159
I think of the reasonable reasons to Bob AT&T off the top of my head the ones that I appreciate

389
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,951
Obviously

390
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,559
It's just strange to me that immediately as this special report open

391
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
The options

392
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,959
But he's presenting for why the person did what they did like her motivation or identical beliefs

393
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,823
String totally he's identifying with and sympathizing with

394
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,687
The actor in this case

395
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,527
I don't know maybe they specifically chose was there a note

396
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,135
Brian stelter looks like a pedophile cuz I feel like that my tie back to me

397
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,695
Come up later

398
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
Of course it does Alex

399
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,863
He's planted this Colonel of like AT&T own CNN

400
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Answer that he goes from

401
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
In the summer of

402
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
2080

403
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
Was then adopted

404
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Every other

405
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Cable news

406
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Broadcast News

407
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Organization

408
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
5 States

409
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Donald Trump

410
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Criticizing the Press

411
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Tax on him

412
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Going to trigger

413
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
Terrorist attack

414
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
On their facility

415
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
The murder of

416
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Journalist

417
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
They hammer

418
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Hundred

419
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Hundred hundreds of time

420
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
With no proof

421
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
So what's going on now is it Alex is trying to

422
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,287
Plant the idea that CNN said trumps rhetoric would lead to a rise in attacks on journalists as your operation sure they

423
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:33,407
Christmas Day RV bomb AT&T is Nashville headquarters of AT&T owns CNN

424
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
Even though everyone knows that the CNN centers in Atlanta

425
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,879
This is stupid already been plenty of other examples you can

426
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,183
22 of their rhetoric

427
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,279
Increases the u.s. Press Freedom tracker

428
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
You can little service that document attracts attacks

429
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Journalist in the United States

430
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
In 2018 there were 30

431
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
35

432
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,847
In 2019 34 little progress one last that's good and 74

433
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Like that's a joke

434
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
Yeah some of this is civilians assaulting depressed but

435
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Considerable chunk

436
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,551
Police carrying out these results

437
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
It's hard not to see this kind of ripple effect

438
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,488
What's rhetoric where you labels the press the enemy of the people and also Khan

439
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
Constantly talk about

440
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Can get in trouble

441
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
If I work up I think I might go

442
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,168
Get the signs with the president is trying to subtly

443
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,008
Julie told me to hit a journalist and he'll look the other way

444
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
Midwife

445
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,872
Disagree Outlaw mares agree that you should hit

446
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
People that's grey

447
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,504
There's no need for an RV bomb at the AT&T building to pay off the fears

448
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
Horizon danger for journalists

449
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
That argument

450
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,880
Be easily made without air

451
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
This

452
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,720
Doesn't even really satisfy in terms of like

453
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh so you're going back

454
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
2 years

455
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,864
To something that you yelled about about Sienna and being

456
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Predictive

457
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Elementary

458
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:06,080
Really thin you can see that there has been no right-wing violence

459
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
That thing was crazy

460
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
Thankfully I

461
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:14,272
Exposed it to everybody Alex's careful

462
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
What's make

463
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Quick clarification

464
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
Be crystal clear

465
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Infowars is not

466
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
CNN

467
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
They are the main mouth

468
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Other criminal elements

469
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Of the deep state

470
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
And Shadow government

471
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
They're battling

472
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Controls

473
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
The United States

474
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:38,592
So the clarification is that Alex isn't saying that Sienna is behind the bombing just there a mouthpiece for the evil demon

475
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,896
Globalist or Tractor Salvage control the country

476
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
If you're following his point he saying

477
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
He doesn't want to sue him

478
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
His theory is that

479
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Beetle globalist

480
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
Carried out the bombing to retain to do all of the United States was a danger

481
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
Thank you for clarifying that it was not

482
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
CNN who was behind the

483
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,424
Seems like they're still in on it he could probably get them but

484
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
I don't think there

485
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Hind

486
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
Who's make clip

487
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,896
Received another characteristic of Alex's bulshit is the

488
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,736
Listen pretty much every single thing that he calls a false-flag heap

489
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
Is that why there's a chance it's real

490
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Maybe

491
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
What do you like the reason

492
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,720
What is bomber may have 1%

493
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
It is entirely

494
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
Possible that a lone wolf

495
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Small group

496
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Querida shop

497
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
Look up the history of

498
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
Who stands to gain from

499
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
And all the media DNA programming

500
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
This thing reeks as a

501
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
The possible.

502
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
False flag

503
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
So it's a

504
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
Possible deep state flag operation at this point until 3

505
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,928
Leader in the Special Report

506
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Statement

507
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
I don't know how well it carries over to stay

508
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
What's 2

509
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,936
Been following yeah yeah it takes you longer to get into it warm up today

510
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
It's almost like if you say it first

511
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Then the rest of them don't count

512
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,640
Like I said this the first time so you know that I still mean it on the other way

513
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
This

514
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
He's really

515
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
What are the main thrust I believe of what

516
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,088
He saying is that two years ago CNN did all this s***

517
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
That right they are planning to do this now

518
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Do weird

519
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
In August

520
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
October

521
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
2080

522
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
I went to the airway

523
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Desperately

524
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
The MSN

525
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Clearly

526
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Preconditioning the

527
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
Ceratac

528
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
But they said we reminisce

529
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Kit mainstream media

530
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
That it wasn't

531
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
The fault whatever patch

532
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
Take credit for Donald

533
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Panache Watson

534
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Exact same rhetoric

535
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Before

536
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Right before

537
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
1995

538
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Oklahoma City

539
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
The bombings That Was Then blamed on the Patriot movement

540
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
And rustling

541
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Right

542
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
Sowell

543
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
Had they not

544
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Donuts

545
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
I don't think we would have blamed

546
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,424
Borat well there is

547
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Matter

548
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:16,544
Kind of thinking

549
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
See the connective tissue here

550
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
Even as a conspiracy I think this is soft

551
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Really soft

552
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,832
I think the softest part of it is you are telling me that CNN

553
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:34,208
Is a multibillion-dollar a year Corporation and they spent

554
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
2 years

555
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
Planning this bombing

556
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
This Bobby I feel like the hardest part

557
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,704
Complain about this was the AV system that shouted

558
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:50,848
There's a bomb coming

559
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,920
In terms of timing terms of motive

560
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
In terms of

561
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Method

562
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,040
I got CNN did finally win the war on Chris

563
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
Is that what he's going for is Alex's whole thing is that like

564
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
These false flags are supposed to

565
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Create

566
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Shock and terror is like

567
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Horror then like

568
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Why would

569
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,072
There be a warning to get away from it

570
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
Do you know why would

571
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
The globalist want

572
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:19,776
To kill people they don't care about human life why wouldn't it doesn't make any sense

573
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
His MOS

574
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
It just

575
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
You know what it felt like listening to this

576
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
It's just trying to fit a square peg

577
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
Into around here

578
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Just doesn't work

579
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
He's just

580
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
This is

581
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Grimm

582
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,112
This one might be just too confusing

583
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,720
It's a make a good conspiracy theory out of confusion can be done

584
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
It can't be done can be done

585
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
It requires finesse

586
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
Requires a little bit of

587
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
Trying not ready to try anymore

588
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
Like everyone is not

589
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Scared

590
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,176
Everyone is kind of scratching their head going like

591
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Why

592
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:04,320
I think people are scared and racially

593
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
Traumatic event and I think a lot of

594
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,440
I think a lot of

595
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,768
You know I didn't cause a lot of Destruction

596
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Certainly

597
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
You know it's not I don't think

598
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
I don't

599
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:24,032
Did it scares people in the same way some other much more casualty

600
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,712
But I do still think of people like see something like that in our scared I apologize for minimizing the feelings of the people

601
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
Who are directly affected by it

602
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
I meant more of the people who'll be affected by the

603
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Conspiracy

604
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
You know obviously I'm not going to be like whatever you got blowed up

605
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,304
Right right this though is such a thing

606
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
All of these Q conspiracies and all this stuff kind of bees

607
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Seem to be swirling

608
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
Together but even then

609
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
The traction is just more like

610
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,080
I guess we got to wait until we find out why the guy actually did it

611
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
This this one

612
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,200
Seems tough

613
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,504
I don't describe it as you like

614
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
Trying to walk a little bit fast

615
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
Peter Weber

616
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,952
Holding scissors just worried about slipping

617
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
It doesn't have track

618
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Watching it doesn't

619
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
It doesn't

620
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
It doesn't know it's a weird one

621
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Yeah really weird situation

622
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
Special Report

623
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,824
Just maybe like 20 seconds after he said maybe at 3

624
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
But it was the Deep state

625
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Within days

626
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
The Supreme Court

627
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Michigan declaring

628
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Governor Whitmer

629
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
Was nothing more than a dick

630
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,552
Heather covid lockdowns where you legal

631
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
Suddenly the FBI

632
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
A carousel a militia

633
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
It came out a week later that

634
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
The terror cell was

635
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Lead

636
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Bye

637
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
To FBI

638
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Informant

639
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
And the whole thing of it

640
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Set up

641
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
That is a smaller microcosm

642
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Deep state.

643
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Ashley carryout

644
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Larger terror attack

645
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
We just witnessed

646
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Nashville Tennessee

647
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Po-boy

648
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,664
To be clear out of context

649
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,224
At all when pretty much says it's not

650
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
Spitballing he's not asking

651
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,600
Can't you just literally said that the Tennessee Volunteers carried out by the Deep state

652
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,928
It's in the context of his meeting was rambling but it's still

653
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
The definite statement

654
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,024
Suggesting it's possible that the Deep state did this

655
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,584
He's explicitly arrived at that conclusion

656
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
And that is

657
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
Being put to the audience also

658
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
The Minnesota

659
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,008
Michigan Supreme Court did not declare

660
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
And that was not a fake kidnapping

661
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
No no

662
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,408
You're going to look me in the eye and tell me that

663
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
The devil

664
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
Said to these people

665
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
No death

666
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Yeah yeah that's part of the devils

667
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Turkey

668
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
Hey listen

669
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
Spider injuries only

670
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
So

671
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
You might be asking like

672
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Wonder why

673
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
What does the globalist

674
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,264
Game through this what are the globalist game

675
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
This country is in a Nexus

676
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Battle fighting

677
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Very

678
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Existence

679
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Level of steak

680
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
25 days

681
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Attempt

682
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
Installment

683
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Coordination

684
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Of their ages

685
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Joe Biden

686
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
The mainstream media is on the ropes

687
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
Item

688
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Believe them

689
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
They don't trust

690
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
The medes massive evidence

691
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Collective Alexa

692
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Fraud

693
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Carry On The Deep state

694
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
And their cohorts

695
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
The system need

696
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Something

697
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Could turn themselves into Vic

698
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
This is designed

699
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
Silence the American

700
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
To the great reset

701
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Huge covid-19

702
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
Permanent

703
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
This is just

704
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
See my Giselle

705
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
No no

706
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,208
That's the stupid isn't it strange though like how uninspiring on inspired this is just like

707
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
Really

708
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
Is to make the globalists look like

709
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,424
Victims what is that doesn't that doesn't fit what's going on

710
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,544
At all you know like if is if this was the Boston bombing then you can sell me on on

711
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
Something like that

712
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
But this is just so different

713
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,408
It's just so different

714
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,200
Can't say the same thing

715
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,736
What about something that

716
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,808
This different and what I don't understand is like

717
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,880
The Christmas angle isn't even in it for

718
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
There's no attack on Christmas isn't a war on Christmas

719
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
Christmas at the literal bombing on Chris

720
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,888
She still of the opinion that when

721
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
It comes out

722
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:41,056
The full story it's going to be somebody more on the I hate the people who have the war on Christmas side

723
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,640
So he probably thinks preemptively I don't know if I can pull that one off

724
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
That may be but maybe

725
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
All I know

726
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Is that Alex

727
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,808
Is man with the Deep archives

728
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
India's great

729
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Employees working for him

730
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,440
Pull up every time but he said

731
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
The false flags are coming

732
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
I have been on record

733
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
The times in the last

734
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
We are now

735
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Out in the season

736
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,656
The false flag

737
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
We are now the season of

738
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
The establishment

739
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
The bomb themselves

740
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,312
Three victims and I have our archivist

741
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
Looking for it right now

742
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
But thanks to Media Matters George Soros

743
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
We have to exam

744
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
From 2 years ago

745
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Where I warned and

746
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Foreshadowed

747
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
We now

748
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
So it does not have these activists are working on it

749
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,072
Coming in on Christmas trying to find these clips

750
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,424
To go through to find those short

751
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,800
Got to figure that out

752
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Keep track for

753
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,832
The clips that Alex plays from Media Matters of him

754
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
Predicting

755
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
What

756
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
We saw

757
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
He's a gentleman this is about

758
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:05,536
Taking down America and Trump and the recovery of the entire Free Press

759
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
Like night follows day

760
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
State Fair attacks

761
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Coming

762
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
Big Tech

763
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Government building

764
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
Mainstream media

765
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,688
All the stars will be gone that day all the stelter's will be gone that day

766
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
All the

767
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
Lester Holt's will be gone

768
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
And they are going to drive

769
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
Bomber something into a daycare

770
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,160
CNN rabc or something and

771
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
People shooting everybody you name it

772
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
Reprogramming

773
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,144
I hate that they're saying that it's a cover-up antifa

774
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Rand Paul on all the calls to kidnap Baron and raping

775
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
We've got to get this out

776
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Tropic. Let him know

777
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,616
He says you're big news

778
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
You're lying another races I love Mexicans whatever

779
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Same thing with me

780
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
Stop out of context

781
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Text to build this

782
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,952
I got the media they got the Democrats I got Warner reportedly running at all

783
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Ready

784
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
Quarterback this whole

785
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,072
Crabbing today tomorrow

786
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
Understand

787
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
Peter only probing attack

788
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
The shut it up at a test

789
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
The public will they buy the

790
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
And Hillary

791
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Annabelle

792
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
And Obama is

793
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Victim

794
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
Whine and moan

795
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
Enroll

796
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Big ass truck

797
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,136
Atlanta

798
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
Special meeting that day

799
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Closest

800
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,864
They'll even take out a large group of their top people

801
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
MSNBC ABC

802
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
I have a couple reasons why I don't take anything that Alex blade there is sincere or a meeting for prediction of

803
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
About what actually happened

804
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
On Friday

805
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
The first is italics literally says the target would be CNN Center in Atlanta and it would happen when Brian stelter and Lester Holt

806
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,392
There because they would have Advance warning

807
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
Which we've seen played out

808
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Stelter and Holt

809
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Do not work in tennis

810
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
All right the second major reason that this Rings Hollow to me is that the specific of Alex mentioning a truck bomb and date

811
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
Care Center that's

812
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
Not meaningful in terms of a prediction

813
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
Harkening back

814
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,080
Oklahoma City is very specifically apart of

815
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
Right wing

816
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,944
Terrorist history zeitgeist

817
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,248
The Patriot World they've been done being torn between

818
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
Celebrating Timothy McVeigh

819
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
The third reason I take issue with this prediction

820
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
It's because these clips

821
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,952
We're from two and a half years ago

822
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,304
This article that Alex is planning a Media Matters that clip promise from August

823
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
2018

824
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:52,192
So just stretches any kind of credulity to imagine that the globalist like broadcasting their signal

825
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,008
Pushing the pre-programming so hard that Alec

826
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
What's picked up on them

827
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Then we did

828
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
28 months

829
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,384
And carry out a stage bombing the didn't kill anyone

830
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,712
The building is owned by CNN's parent company but isn't really associated

831
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
Correct this is bensu

832
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
He should be doing

833
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,440
I actually I think what we'll see you tomorrow or Tuesday or when he starts

834
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
Hit the ground rolling on this

835
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
This is a prick

836
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
You have to call this

837
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
The practice run

838
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,376
Before they act

839
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Chili do the real

840
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
You mean like those of the bombing

841
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,776
Yeah

842
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:34,176
I thought you meant this video is a practice

843
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:40,320
Time to make a conspiracy out of that's in heat

844
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,648
You just talkin to a mirror it is all fake

845
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:49,024
That's possible but also the fourth reason I reject this b******* is because Alex

846
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Constantly predict

847
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
False flags and bombings

848
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
And ship that never happened

849
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,960
If I wanted to I could put together a giant compilation of him doing just that

850
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
And it turns out

851
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
I do want

852
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,664
How's the weather Chicago usually I'll just say I could do it but I actually did it

853
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,296
Coming and calling random events

854
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
Speck All rights could have been

855
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,648
So much longer

856
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,256
And it could have been so much longer but I feel like that's already trying already on his way to

857
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,584
Breaking-in were following us earlier just an hour ago

858
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,656
How to stop market was only down 600

859
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,520
Today was just one

860
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Ever

861
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,592
And then founded

862
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,640
800 points

863
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,528
You talk about deep State operation

864
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,600
Goldman Sachs JPMorgan isn't working against the president

865
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,512
This is the type of craziness we've been single come

866
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:58,912
Evidence is mounting that the mega fires in Australia are being orchestrated

867
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:05,312
By multinational forces to clear out she corridors for future development

868
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Elopement

869
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:11,200
And for light rail going in that's being financed by the communist Chinese

870
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,272
They are intending to remove Trump one way or another

871
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,832
They're going to trigger a civil war

872
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,904
Winger's blue stuff up when Trump gets remote

873
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
Truck bomb

874
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
When they removed from

875
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Use that for a total

876
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,144
The economy's going to implode

877
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,728
Then there's going to be homeless running around crazy everywhere

878
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,568
All they got to do is have the Chinese or Supply 90% of the opiates

879
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Tacos off for about a month

880
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
And it's going to look like a zombie apocalypse

881
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
Call alisher Fairmont

882
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
False flag

883
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
False flag event

884
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,776
But I can tell you

885
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Right now

886
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Gentleman bed

887
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
Communist forces

888
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
Party funding combine

889
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
Assaults on

890
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
Stations in federal buildings tonight

891
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
All across the United States

892
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
And when the Austin Police

893
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
Photos and video of this

894
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
To the mayor's office

895
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
Seen the photos I've seen

896
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
This is happening

897
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,432
We knew Governor Northam was declared emergency we knew he was going to try to

898
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
Then they stage a false flag with a provocateur

899
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
An action

900
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Jussie Smollett

901
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
Style

902
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
Steroid

903
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
And then they say look

904
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,608
The gun owners are the evil terrorist or the wife

905
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Supremacist

906
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
And I run the same operation

907
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,704
We saw the Democrat

908
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
Controlled State Police did

909
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,288
A couple years ago in Charlottesville

910
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,848
Escalation

911
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,944
Is assassinating the president

912
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
Beijing Giant

913
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,320
Blaming it on the right-wing Patriots and they're going to do it

914
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,440
Call the clintons and the Obamas

915
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
What's a mental patient

916
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
Roundup on

917
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
Psychotropics in

918
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,752
Hotel room right now

919
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,568
Okay.

920
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Everywhere ready to go

921
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
A couple buttons

922
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
There's no way to stop

923
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,016
Are false Flags unless

924
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
The leadership

925
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
The bobalust he's dealt with

926
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,160
You know what eats real folks there's nothing fake here

927
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:06,560
You think I'm so damn real I can't stand that sometimes control myself

928
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,192
I totally real

929
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Why do you

930
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
People

931
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,920
Author they can't stand that see

932
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
They can't scare me

933
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Probably

934
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
Broadcast I'm your calls but

935
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:48,288
I think they're getting ready to a false flag and they might kill me and I am only seven.

936
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,407
On my way there, you know what I mean

937
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:58,015
I think they could do a nuclear false flag dirty bomb

938
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,855
Or nuclear attack

939
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
Exactly

940
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
Trump

941
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
They blame it on

942
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,231
Patriots are they blame it on Trump

943
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,303
Negotiations with North Korea they could say it's North Korea

944
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,863
Fighting back before Iran

945
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
But they take out Trump

946
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,263
And they take out 200,000 Americans at the same time and then they use that

947
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:24,127
The Blacklist all conservatives all speech online and any dissenting views

948
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,783
This is the plan they have to silence do Alex and they have a silence me before way they wouldn't be taking the rest

949
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
To shut us down

950
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,023
Well before the election they're going to hit us

951
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,119
Biological or nuclear event

952
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
Witches

953
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
It's in the cards

954
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,527
Just like two people running away from

955
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Bioweapon

956
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,263
You can DJ during State of the Union

957
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
Congress shouldn't be in session in the buildings

958
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
President should never be in d.c.

959
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
You're in a Total War people

960
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,439
Is gone from 1% to 95%

961
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
And apologize

962
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
Please eat your happy

963
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:52,191
Yeah I feel like that was a little bit long but the reason I made it that long is because I want to drive home this point

964
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,519
The point is made pretty sure it's driven

965
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,335
This is what he does

966
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
This is not a

967
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
Prediction that Alex is making

968
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Hayden obsession

969
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
The centerpiece of his world

970
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:11,135
On some level he knows that his political alignment is just full of cause playing militia weirdos who lust after the opportunity

971
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:15,487
Violence they can justify being necessary to water the tree of Liberty or whatever

972
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,047
He knows that so the only real option

973
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
We can produce

974
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,375
You can either applaud terrorist Acts

975
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Domestic terrorist activity

976
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,215
Tough or you pretend they don't exist

977
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
If you go the first option

978
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,895
He'll eventually you'll end up ostracizing yourself even from the pseudo acceptable world of the

979
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
The French

980
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
The second option just

981
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,991
Requires a mantra you drill into your audience

982
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
In this case

983
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,575
If there's an act of terrorism that looks like it could have been

984
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
Carried out by someone who believes

985
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
Same shift as me

986
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
It's fake until proven otherwise

987
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,487
The evil nebulous group I'm fighting that's

988
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,791
Just trying to make me look bad to ignore it

989
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,095
And keep pushing deeper into the fanatical world.

990
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
Except rationalizes

991
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Inexcusable

992
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
This kind of activity

993
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,239
And that has nothing to do with what the actual

994
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
Like a result of what

995
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
The event was

996
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Doesn't matter

997
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,503
That was his response is going to be to call it fake

998
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
That itself

999
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
Could implicate his beliefs

1000
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
That's just

1001
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
It's very

1002
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Boring

1003
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
It is boring

1004
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743
And it's it's just hard

1005
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,839
It's really disheartening that it and it is unfair

1006
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:29,471
You can set your watch by right-wing terrorism and so he gets to run interference whenever he wants because it's

1007
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
Going to happen

1008
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
You know

1009
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
It's so f****** annoying

1010
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:39,711
Core The Narrative here this false flag narrative the way that Alex uses it

1011
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,295
Is just a way of weaponizing and making money off denial

1012
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
That's just what you're doing

1013
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,623
And it's

1014
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
Like I said when I say it's a boring

1015
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:54,559
I mean it's really boring when you look at it in the Longview when you look at his career and recognize like

1016
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
All of this

1017
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Dumb s***

1018
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
You keep saying is like research

1019
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,215
Yeah I study the globalist I know there

1020
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,775
Patterns of an every f****** pattern is wrong

1021
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,335
Nothing ends up happening that he says is going to happen

1022
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
And then

1023
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
It's not boring

1024
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,967
The trick itself is not boring trick itself

1025
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Is

1026
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,807
Possibly very dangerous

1027
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,159
Yeah because the first time you're exposed to the idea of a false flag

1028
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,999
And it's not just something that only exist in fiction shirt

1029
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
Cheetos make you think like oh my God everything yeah and that's the danger of that that that

1030
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,423
Tripwire Alex

1031
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
Can set out in front of you

1032
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,239
The same thing happened to Rogan

1033
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,335
When Rogan talks to Alex about the only things that he thinks Alex has been right about

1034
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,407
Told me that agent provocateurs exist

1035
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,991
Okay great your mind was blown by that

1036
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,807
But that mind-blowing event was used for malicious

1037
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Purposes

1038
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
And I think

1039
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
Alex knows

1040
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
On some level

1041
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,951
No matter how stupid

1042
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
This conspiracy is

1043
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
About this bomb

1044
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
No matter how

1045
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
Lacking

1046
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
In connective tissue it is no matter how

1047
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
Sad it looks

1048
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Still look at

1049
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
It might blow someone's mind

1050
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:11,103
Yeah there might be someone that's all they need to hear is a denial

1051
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,919
Of some reality that's in their face

1052
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
So infuriating

1053
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,479
Mimikyu box office at

1054
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,623
Like the thing that weirds me out it's so much less believable

1055
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Because every

1056
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
Right-wing attack terror attack is a false

1057
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
You know

1058
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Look

1059
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
I get it

1060
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,839
Putin one 97% of the

1061
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,471
Alright 99% of all of these right-wing Terror attacks

1062
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
That are

1063
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
People doing the things

1064
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
You say they should do

1065
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,103
Political politically

1066
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,687
99% of them are all false Flags

1067
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
Come on man City Bombing with him well and ninety-nine percent of things that you

1068
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
You make up that don't happen

1069
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
Come on man

1070
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
It's

1071
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:11,007
But he can't muddy the waters because then you're not sure that they're all false right you're not sure

1072
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:17,407
The idea of

1073
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
Real critical thinking

1074
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
That you engage in

1075
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,551
You are with the audience and event allows the audience to engage in

1076
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,367
Maybe this is a false flag

1077
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
I don't know let's see

1078
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
Yeah you can

1079
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,743
Accidentally encourage your audience

1080
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:37,119
To start questioning you don't want them to do that

1081
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
Did any doubt will

1082
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
F*** you up

1083
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:45,311
Yeah and that's why I looks like there's a real 20 seconds later be like

1084
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:51,711
The appearance of questioning and the appearance of critical thinking while at the same time driving home your predetermined

1085
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Conclusion

1086
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Yep at

1087
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Just

1088
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
Unfounded

1089
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,439
So good as all the signatures man it is all the signatures of the false

1090
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
There's a pattern

1091
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
Call swag

1092
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
Luminary stages

1093
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
This fits

1094
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
Completes in

1095
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
To that historical.

1096
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
But regard

1097
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
Authoritarian

1098
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
Will try to use the

1099
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
This event

1100
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031

I've given up

1105
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Years

1106
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,175
Alluding at

As a message

1109

Change to the cords

1110
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
And the system

1111
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
If you don't give us what we wanted

1112
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
You don't let us

1113
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Steal the election

1114
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Install

We will burn

City

1119
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:41,887
Avoid using the word regardless because he's

1120
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:48,287
But regardless

1121
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:54,943
Jodi Arias

1122
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Thoughts

1123
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Which

1124
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
Is his refrain

1125
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
But he says on pretty much every

1126
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Time you want

1127
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,159
Wants to say something stupid about a world event the people are

1128
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
Emotionally effect

1129
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
I got the right to question

1130
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,815
Some things Americans can question thing sure

1131
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
Integrate this is not questioning

1132
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Button clothes

1133
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,423
Never forget

1134
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
The long

1135
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
History of government

1136
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
Another organization

1137
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,311
Staging false-flag terratech

1138
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
The Blinder political app

1139
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
And remember

1140
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
The American Birthright

1141
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Research

1142
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
And question any public event

1143
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,831
I mean yeah research and question whatever you want this is what that

1144
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
Yeah this is

1145
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
Is b******* is a little bit different

1146
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:42,047
It is it is your birthday to research and question things but it is not your Birthright to go on the radio and tell

1147
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
People that are supposed

1148
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,119
Right I feel like that's not right

1149
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:50,239
I don't know if George Washington was it hanging out being like way way way way way

1150
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,543
Eventually working invent the radio

1151
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:57,663
I have a laissez-faire I have a difficult time thinking that

1152
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,479
I mean first of all I don't know I do want to get into a First Amendment

1153
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:05,087
Debate but I don't think it's responsible and questioning Behavior

1154
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Or

1155
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,159
You know like something that has a lot of value in

1156
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,463
Society just get on the radio

1157
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
And with no evidence be like

1158
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
The Deep state

1159
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
That's stupid

1160
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:19,423
That can only lead to negative outcomes I mean

1161
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Regardless of what he's saying

1162
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,263
Regardless of any of that

1163
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,615
When you say I'm only researching and questioning that is a bad

1164
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Faithlife

1165
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:35,039
So I don't give a s*** about what you're talkin about deflection I don't know this isn't even a First Amendment conversate

1166
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
This is a I can

1167
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
Pasaway your b*******

1168
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Because you are already lying to

1169
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
The fuk you it's

1170
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,767
It's basically his in closing statement is

1171
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:49,631
Things have happened before and I can get away with this so

1172
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
Clearly

1173
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
Give some credence

1174
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
To what I'm saying

1175
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
Mild like it's

1176
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,007
Just just

1177
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Justice

1178
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
I can't even

1179
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,103
Words other than weak

1180
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,919
Nothing

1181
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
Yeah it's so disappointing

1182
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,807
One last clip here at Alex closes at the report

1183
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,623
He wants to make you afraid of Eric Holder

1184
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Oh damn right

1185
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
Never forget that Joe Biden

1186
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,719
And it would be incoming

1187
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Are part of the Obama

1188
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Crime Oregon

1189
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Annotation

1190
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
Never forget it was death

1191
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
General Eric Holder

1192
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Who helped cover up

1193
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,543
The same holder carried out the Giants

1194
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Confirm

1195
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Black operation

1196
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
Fast & Fury

1197
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:39,295
Alex not so self-satisfied

1198
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,855
Is Fast & Furious at me

1199
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,927
I'm going to put that one in the win column guys

1200
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,487
Eric Holder even need

1201
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
Talks to be in vitamins

1202
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
Administration

1203
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,887
His name come up

1204
00:52:54,143 --> 00:53:00,031
Rahm Emanuel name is come up more than Eric Holder and he should be tossed into a Galaxy

1205
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,175
Just doesn't have any specifics left me like how fun it was to make people scared of her folder get back on that

1206
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,527
So I was really struck by how weak and desperate that special report that Alex

1207
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,343
Put out in it's absolutely meaningless there's no

1208
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
Teeth behind it at all

1209
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
I almost

1210
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,791
Kind of felt when I was listening to it that he didn't have a theory but he wanted to yell into the void to remind people that he's weird

1211
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Willing to call everything fake with or without reason and he's ready to do it immediately out a beacon like a lighthouse

1212
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,495
Haha

1213
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,079
There's no fury here there's nothing except knee-jerk denialism which Alex

1214
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:38,431
Attempts to justify by pointing to unrelated years ago

1215
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,479
But how the meeting was going to false-flag themselves

1216
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:43,551
Some of it barely even make sense with the details of the bombing

1217
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,087
It's unconvincing it

1218
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
B flat

1219
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
It's also couch

1220
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,975
I'm so much I'm not saying I'm just saying kind of language that it's hard to even imagine him

1221
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Learn about this

1222
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,815
Reckless abandon is easy to mistake for passion

1223
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,119
Tyrone asprea

1224
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Just feel hollow

1225
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:04,799
I was curious about qanon was doing with this bombing so I reached out to Travis over at Tycoon on Anonymous and he directed me

1226
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
Some of the theories

1227
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,871
Better popped up and gain Traction in that world

1228
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,151
They're all nuts

1229
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,943
But they're better than Alex

1230
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,599
They seem to have theories that surround the idea that there was like a secret NSA server at the AT&T building they would somehow prove that the

1231
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Georgia

1232
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
Comprar conspiracies were true

1233
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,463
So the bombing was actually the good guy setting off at

1234
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
Controlled detonation

1235
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
To recover the evidence

1236
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
Stop biting from getting into office

1237
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,887
Or possibly prevent the bad guys from being able to steal the upcoming

1238
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:36,287
Rica run runoff election in Georgia next one

1239
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:42,687
Helping it makes sense with the larger conspiracy that are actually being engaged in the qanon world that's fair

1240
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
The audience

1241
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,039
McEwen on his capture where is Alex's narrative is just dull and uninspired

1242
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,087
It was almost entirely disconnect

1243
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Anything else

1244
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
He's been yelling about except for the fact

1245
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
False Flags

1246
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
The comment which I stressed

1247
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
He does all the

1248
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,303
The time 25.6 minutes

1249
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
Iowa

1250
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
Ipw feeling do it

1251
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,959
No he's not selling it

1252
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,775
You got it look if you got week material you got to

1253
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:11,103
Sell it you know that's the one thing that I've learned from stand-up

1254
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,455
So long if you got weak material you perform the s*** out of that material

1255
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,575
And maybe you'll state by and help you push up the the next level and this

1256
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
You got it

1257
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Yeah it's

1258
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
It's it's almost like

1259
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Kind of

1260
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,767
It has the feeling of a guy in like a like a

1261
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Recliner

1262
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:34,399
Do you like it I told you so

1263
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,191
But there's nothing there being told

1264
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,031
Because that is kind of the idea the I Told You So is him playing the eclipse

1265
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,103
From 2018 very said that's his name is going to be

1266
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,663
It almost feels like a

1267
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Victory lap

1268
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:50,015
But there was no rain

1269
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,343
Yeah he should be petting a cat on his lap just like

1270
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,623
I told all of you

1271
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,415
You what would happens almost

1272
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Confuse

1273
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,815
It's almost disorienting now disconnected it is from anything that feels real

1274
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
Or anything that even make

1275
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
Makes sense as like

1276
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
Conspiracy

1277
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
Water

1278
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:11,007
But that's that's the thing that like when I was looking at these these qanon things

1279
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
Is the Travis

1280
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,055
Pointed me towards Lake

1281
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,847
I was looking at those like I get it

1282
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,431
I get where this is going sure

1283
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:22,271
Media wants to make themselves look like the victims

1284
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Yeah

1285
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
It's not extinct

1286
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
I think on this one the cement is too wet

1287
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
Descendants

1288
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,951
This man is too wet right now

1289
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,279
I think this is going to be the first one where it's like

1290
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:39,679
2 days everyone will have a much better conspiracy there they had more time to Workshop it they got more details to

1291
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
To play with

1292
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
There just aren't enough you know like

1293
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
That's it

1294
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,847
Thank you ate with immediately

1295
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
Suspect

1296
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,175
There's so many different people you could

1297
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,735
Investigating go down and on this one it's like

1298
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,271
I don't even know where to start

1299
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:58,367
That kind of thing and so all these people are just coming up with

1300
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Nonsense

1301
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Yeah

1302
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,975
It's a it's a

1303
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:08,863
Same like in between. Of an election and inauguration and the recount

1304
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,215
Runoff election is it worth it going

1305
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
Anan

1306
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,543
Yeah so much other s*** to deal with

1307
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:22,431
So I'm interested to see where Alex goes with it's cuz I think I mean

1308
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,503
It seems like this is something that's going to

1309
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,783
Yeah has to be something

1310
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
He keeps going

1311
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:32,415
And I'm interested to see what the narrative flushes out to be whether he gets in line with

1312
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
Qanon theories that are

1313
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
Already

1314
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,047
Much Fuller than his

1315
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Becomes

1316
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
I don't know.

1317
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,399
Will become

1318
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,983
I don't know I just think that there is some value in

1319
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
Taking a look

1320
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:47,775
At

1321
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
The immediate reaction

1322
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,615
I agree because this is

1323
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,735
He knew he had to do some

1324
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,367
What he said before he

1325
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,903
He's going to say something to

1326
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
You know like

1327
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:08,255
We have to at least admit this is uninspired

1328
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,815
But this is without question

1329
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Questionnaire

1330
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,119
Easy receipt against

1331
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
Tomorrow's ball

1332
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,959
Maybe even today

1333
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,751
Kind of level

1334
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
Yeah

1335
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Yeah we'll see

1336
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Oh we will

1337
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,223
Please my apologies if anybody felt

1338
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,111
Anything that we discussed or any of our town was flippant about the bombing

1339
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,159
My heart goes out to everybody

1340
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
Affected

1341
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
I don't

1342
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,023
I don't want you to think that you know

1343
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:45,631
My mocking Alex's bees

1344
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,447
People are having it's not brutal

Does not

1347
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,543
That brutal cell

1348
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,079
It is it is just

1349
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,735

If you could please find a local charity or Bellefonte in your area to help out

1352
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
People doing God's work

1353

Insisting that Alex eat that hat
