1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need need money

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Crushing a b after several weeks

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
The practicing attention to it perfectly

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
I don't appreciate positive

10
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,016
Fair enough, what do you appreciate that

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Because my question is what is your bright spot this week

12
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,976
A good people about this and vibrate spot is

13
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
After four and a half years I've decided to take a vacation

14
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
The first time

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,056
In a very long time it's debatable if you days off here and there

16
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,872
I went to visit my parents

17
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
A holiday

18
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Not quite vacation we went to Austin to do a live show

19
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
When you got to

20
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
Book and write it off on Earth

21
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
I don't really know how to relax

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
I'm not really good at that and but finally we've decided to take a vacation

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
And your partner actually going together Nightcore

24
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,520
I will be going to Hawaii

25
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,592
You for a week officially

26
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Exactly

27
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,200
A big part of this is I've been meaning to take a trip back to my childhood home

28
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,832
Honolulu and Aulani Elementary School in

29
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
Go to Waikiki Beach

30
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,720
You know kick around to the spino the old deal with the hots

31
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
Oh yeah.

32
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,400
I have a lot of like sort of vague memories and snapshots in my head that I'd like

33
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Like to experience hasn't

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Adult

35
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
To try and fill in some of those gaps

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
I'm very excited

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
2

38
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
Take this trip and hope I don't freak out

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
From lack of working

40
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,272
Sometimes you're going to stay in your hotel late at night by yourself

41
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Staring up at

42
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
The feeling

43
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
What if I were work

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
King right now

45
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,440
Better I don't doubt that will be the case

46
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,768
Also this is relevant because

47
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
The next three episodes we're going to have to

48
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
Preparing is a

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Of taking off for vacation

50
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Hopefully

51
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
The schedule of release won't be affected At All by

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Notice

53
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
That they will be maybe

54
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:32,224
Hey what's up let's say something happens in the world we may not be aware of we may not know because we're in

55
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
Trump Mike raisbeck

56
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Back to Powerade

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
Definitely will not know

58
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
I don't know I think of anything super crazy happen will probably break into a recording studio somewhere bill

59
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
Hey we got it

60
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,192
Guidon on vacation on Lake January 4th

61
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,336
BFF episodes coming out and we wouldn't be aware that the capital of thunderstorm

62
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
That's what I'm saying

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
View

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Spore

65
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
Alibi you're doing with your breakfast at my partners as you know my partner is

66
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,256
The teacher at school to be unnamed

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
But

68
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Basically

69
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,655
Their new principal started at the beginning of this

70
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
This school year

71
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
You're so

72
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
And she has proven herself to be a

73
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Giant Reese's Pieces

74
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Really bad thing about naming the school

75
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
To the point where all of the PPI bipoc staff and students have

76
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Eventually just gone on f****** revolt

77
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Wow

78
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Unsustainable

79
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
And so today

80
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
These kids organized

81
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
The f****** sit-in

82
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
And then later on a walk out

83
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,447
And my partner sent me a little clip of it and

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
The

85
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
Bipoc students

86
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Leading this s*** are

87
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Absolutely astonishing

88
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
At a certain point all these kids are chanting protect our

89
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
Teachers protect our teachers

90
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
And I'm like

91
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Weeping my balls off

92
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Like these are

93
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
These kids are incredible

94
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,975
Great like truly incredible and that's my price but absolutely

95
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
Put on them

96
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
So Jordan

97
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Today we have an interesting

98
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
Situations get into his eyes I mentioned

99
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,239
Yeah we're going to be pre-recording some episodes and that's going to make it more difficult to be

100
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
In the present-day keeping up with Alex so my plan to you no stay in the past in 2003 problem

101
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
For those episode

102
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
That's why I didn't want to do 2003 episode here

103
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Today

104
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,135
And it so I was like alright present-day let's see what Alex is going at 2

105
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Look

106
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
Alex has been on vacation

107
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
Why don't we coordinate

108
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
He needs to let us know we always have in the past

109
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,335
This is infuriating

110
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,455
I understand the situation israel-palestine

111
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Ray's B big deal

112
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
I do understand that

113
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,343
I don't care what Owen Shroyer has to say about what I salute

114
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,695
I'm interested in the Infowars position and exactly how this is a false flag and

115
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,279
And what happened

116
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
I'm not going to listen to an hour and a half to get a sensitive really don't need to hear Owen say what amounts to

117
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
None of this is

118
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:37,823
Is real it's all Palestine actually attacking themselves and even if Israel was committing genocide

119
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
I support

120
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
I know that's what they would say I'm not I'm not into

121
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
Just didn't hear any of that nonsense from Owen

122
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
There is an update I need to give you about the present day

123
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
Psyop expert

124
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,463
It's been that subtly sneaking his way back onto the show

125
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
Big cannot quit him

126
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,095
Alex

127
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,935
Steve pieczenik is is creeping back

128
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:09,055
And he's just flattering the s*** out of oh and I watched Cory interview to that call you're the best

129
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Horse

130
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,175
Goddamnit these idiots can be tricked in the same way all the time

131
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Time I also noticed that

132
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
When I was watching

133
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
This this interview I noticed that Steve was reading a lot

134
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
Keep clearly looking down at something is rattling off a lot of these details and stuff

135
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
A lot of it

136
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
He's probably

137
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Prepared

138
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Yeah

139
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
I mean

140
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Feel like

141
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
Somehow we're thinking of this

142
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
As a negative thing

143
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
But

144
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Being a guest

145
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
Nbm by far more

146
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,455
Prepared than anything that your host is ever done

147
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
Seems like a positive ion disagree and I support preparation

148
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
I just think

149
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
Think that the wave it's Steve

150
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Uses specific

151
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
And things like that is to

152
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
Create the impression of familiarity

153
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,863
Create the impression of familiarity with the staff of

154
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
You know various administration's it would be kind of not as impressive that he

155
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Dino's people's names

156
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
If it's on a sheet of paper in front of that kind of preparation kind of trying to use

157
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Who's his appearance

158
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
I ended the way you trying to present myself

159
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,367
And rattling off details gives him the appearance of

160
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Having a recall that is

161
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Astonishing

162
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Yes how can

163
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
How can one man possibly

164
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
Play pull all of these things I'll give you making up all of

165
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
The exact

166
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Puryear Steve wouldn't

167
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
The pier on video

168
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:46,079
You'd only be on the phone and there would be like a picture of him from when he was much younger

169
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Sure

170
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
With weird mustache

171
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Yeah but that was because back in those times he had like a bunch of files in front of him and he didn't want to be on

172
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,671
I wonder about that never really thought about things I never really watched

173
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Too closely

174
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
But his eyes were

175
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Definitely reading

176
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
I would also accept

177
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
It wasn't until the pandemic that he insisted that some child in his neighborhood go set up Zoom for him

178
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:18,591
So we can accurately I don't know details

179
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,199
If you do go to the YouTube channel you can see her pressing the start-and-stop button

180
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
That is

181
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Very pretty

182
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,671
It is unfortunately humanizing of a real weirdo

183
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
But it's very cute

184
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,791
So I guess what that leaves us with is

185
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Possibly

186
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
I mean I don't know I don't know

187
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
Can time for us to record anything in the present day.

188
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Our trip

189
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
Right so we may be getting back to Alex in the present day when we get back of not really knowing

190
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
Exactly where to go for this episode luckily

191
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711

192
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
We'll get to it

193
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
After

194

Sometimes

214
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Sometimes

215
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
You know you got to take that

216
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,295
Punch as it comes naturally realize that you was messed up

217
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
Everybody has a plan until they get punched

218
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
In the mouth what is

219
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
A plan but God laughing

220
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
True or something

221
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,303
How's that work no man plans while God laughs

222
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
You got it

223
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
He's going to laugh at anybody for

224
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
For planning nobody it's like that

225
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,871
Oh oh I love this guy so much

00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
F****** offense

229
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
I'm offended by God's God's house of April birthday

00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447

I wish you happy birthday I hope you had a great birthday

233
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
Although I f***** up this one

234
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
I talked to happy birthday back in April

235
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Happy birthday Tanya

236
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,695
It's totally on me I need to do a better job of managing inboxes

237
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Now you're doing

238
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Now

239
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Not all is trouble

240
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,399
Because we also have a present this is coming from Savannah

241
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
Savannah wanted me to give a shout out to their spouse

242
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,103
I wish I was there to Shawna a happy birthday so

243
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Integrate one out there

244
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Perfect

245
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Jordan

246
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
What time do the pass

247
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
When do the present

248
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
We do the middle

249
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
I felt like that might be too confusing me out

250
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Can't go back to that well

251
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
Project Camelot

252
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
I think she got kicked off YouTube

253
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
And now he's back to a membership model

254
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
I don't know about the ethics of using

255
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
I'm back to being an aunt

256
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
Shaky Ground

257
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
I told that leaves us in a bit of a panther

258
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
Okay right got to do something

259
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,903
Is there anything that I've been meaning to do review that

260
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,743
Bottle episode of Breaking Bad

261
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
I have some thoughts okay

262
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
Today

263
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
There is something

264
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Constantly been like

265
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Did you ever do that

266
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
And we had

267
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,823
Broadcast

268
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Just coming up here

269
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,223
That's right

270
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
What are we doing

271
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,623
Feels so weird about the 2001 free 9/11

272
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,231
Noam Chomsky appeared on Infowars

273
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Program

274
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Noam Chomsky

275
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
The linguist

276
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:59,935
Not the very short shows up in your house in the middle of night makes cookies

277
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
Gnome with a G

278
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
No that is not is not

279
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,847
Good gnome chompski alright

280
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,175
It is the the noted intellectual

281
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,807
This actually is one of the more interesting interviews that I've ever heard on Infowars

282
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
3911

283
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
He doesn't have the

284
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
The cachet of predicting 911 yet

285
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,279
I also think that he doesn't have

286
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
Nearly as much of the

287
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
Market share he doesn't have

288
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
As much notoriety I don't think that

289
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,543
People who might be invited to be on his show know much about him

290
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
And so

291
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
But you have you have that

292
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,455
I take it through what is not know that Alex is fighting the literal Deb

293
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
I don't know if Alex knows that

294
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,135
We haven't established that it was pointed the game aware that he was up against

295
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,535
You know I think everleigh is days in his career a lot of it was based around like

296
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
You know making big bubbles

297
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
Distance about trying to get the church

298
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
The Branch Davidians

299
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
3 belt

300
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
He had some notoriety on a regional basis

301
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,591
From that but if you look at the early part of his career really

302
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,711
February 7th

303
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,575
That's got to be all-around 9/11 conspiracy over this is the fourth

304
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
Also another thing that's really weird

305
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Is the day agree about a lot

306
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Of course

307
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,119
Do they actually know they have course they do Alex and Noms

308
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
I agree about a lot of

309
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
CertiFit surface-level of

310
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,407
But when you get down to sort of wet wet what their beliefs are based on

311
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
There's a little bit of difference

312
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
This interview

313
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Could have been

314
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Amazing

315
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
And it could have been

316
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Great

317
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
It is not

318
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
It ends

319
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Very poorly

320
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
I'll let you decide

321
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Alright

322
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
So Alex

323
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
Reed's little bit of

324
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Ibio

325
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
He's a professor of linguistics

326
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
6ya

327
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
And he's written books like Manufacturing

328
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Video

329
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
I'm also called titled manufacture

330
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,463
They will have a supposed to bait on television

331
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
Participating exact implementation

332
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
But just a few degrees

333
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
There's really some

334
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Difference

335
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
Supposedly

336
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Either phony champ

337
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
That's how I put a Chomsky

338
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
Doesn't know it more sophisticated fashion

339
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,487
Manufacturing consent is about the media but it's not necessarily about staging events

340
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,559
Sir false flags are that kind of stuff away Alex's kind of

341
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
Leading in prison

342
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
The general thesis of chomsky's book

343
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:17,311
Largely co-written by Edward Herrmann is it the media engages in self-censoring of ideas that are opposed to the interests of the elite

344
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Corporations

345
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
In such a way that encourages

346
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,431
Acceptance of the policies being put in place by the government

347
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Switch support those enter

348
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Often to the detriment of what's in the interest

349
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
List of normal people

350
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
It's more complicated than what I even what I'm presenting but that's a large part of what Chomsky and Herman called the pro

351
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Propaganda model

352
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,327
It doesn't rely on coercion to operate rather get the product of just Market

353
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Forces

354
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
There's a structural conflict of interest in how the media's organized that creates a disconnect between conveying all of the information that's rather

355
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
Move it to the interest of the upper upper classes

356
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
And those of everyone else

357
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
This is the general

358
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
30000

359
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
Put to you

360
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:02,367
Media were capable of reporting correctly they would be reporting every single day that we should do

361
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
Do everything we can to destroy their billionaire owner

362
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,487
Otherwise their entire journalism is

363
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Interesting

364
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:14,399
I don't think I'll be qualified to give a full breakdown of the idea than that text but I can tell you that I'm also certain

365
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
But Alex has not read it

366
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,495
The propaganda model includes five filters

367
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Theorize is being determined

368
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
About whether certain news is represented in the larger media

369
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,199
The first Fallout 4 our ownership funding sources and flag

370
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:32,063
How to probably find agreement on those for but he absolutely could not accept the 5th

371
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,183
Which is anti-communist

372
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
Strikeout

373
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Difficult

374
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,119
Communism was the preferred media fear Outlet in the time that the book was first

375
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Published

376
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
During the Cold War the massacre went out of style but it is for some people during the Cold War

377
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
For the mass media wasn't going

378
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,431
Going to give a serious chance to an outlet that went at odds with the prevailing narrative which was to be afraid of

379
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
The commies

380
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
In more recent times chomsky's recontextualizing this filters updated

381
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,671
The time where the war on terror is more relevant as a media filter after 9/11 than a communist

382
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
Alex can probably agree the large portions of the media have the

383
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
The same opinion on big issues like a war on terror

384
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,119
And it possibly was meant to scare people into except

385
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Open policies they wouldn't

386
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Maybe otherwise

387
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
But he absolutely couldn't

388
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
Never accepted anti-communist fervor during the Cold War

389
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Was it anyway part of that

390
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,639
Personality

391
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Is built is

392
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
Crumbled

393
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,063
That's kind of interesting what happens is that Alex has

394
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
A predetermined

395
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Set of beliefs

396
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,671
He's just decided the chops

397
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
Ski packs those up

398
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
Or at least enough of them that he

399
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
You can make it look like he supports all

400
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Yes yes

401
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Alex talks

402
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
Before getting into the actual interview

403
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
More about his

404
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,639
This is 2001 the similarities between the left and the right

405
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
Republic has always been very surface

406
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
It's like Republican

407
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Conservative

408
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
The political left

409
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Wear black uniforms

410
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
Police or black uniforms the ski mask around the world

411
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
They just have to

412
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
The police

413
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
In the middle of that system

414
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
More semantical deception

415
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
I think it's strange here is that like

416
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,527
I could hear somebody saying like the left and the right to say and they all wear black ski masks sure

417
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
And it being a metaphor

418
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
Malik I don't think it is

419
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
No it's absolutely Direct

420
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Yeah yeah

421
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,559
If he does not believe that they actually have secret police

422
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,143
Then I don't know what anything is real anymore

423
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
I don't know what's true or what's false

424
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
Batman believes everyone has secret police and ski mask

425
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
Are you believe that like

426
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
Play foundational beliefs system

427
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
He believe he believes it

428
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Small

429
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:13,343
Corporations that have SWAT teams and stuff at this point it's

430
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
I don't even want to know what army

431
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
He thinks AT&T has

432
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
How cute

433
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
I just

434
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,584
I I come away from

435
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Clips like that with a feeling that

436
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Like I don't

437
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
Know-how

438
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
In depth

439
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Any of this

440
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Assessment of

441
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
Like the similarities between left and right off

442
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,896
Cuz I do think you can make a decent argument that there are several are

443
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
Obviously there are

444
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
Entwined interest

445
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
There are

446
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
They're similar priorities

447
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
In some ways but they're also

448
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Huge difference

449
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Email

450
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
And I don't understand how Alex

451
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Never really gives voice to those

452
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,536
Because they're ignores them

453
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Because

454
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
What's the differences make it look like

455
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
They're the people that he actually supports our

456
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Bad

457
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Oh yeah that's right

458
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,616
It is it is hard to be like wow okay there's one difference between

459
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
Democrats do want people to eat food

460
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,784
I was kind of maybe being facetious when I say I don't know why

461
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,856
I realize that I didn't even know that I was being

462
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,464
Here Comes Chomsky

463
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
End of the debate

464
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Sorry babe

465
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Conversation

466
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352
I do have some some agreement and this

467
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
This is a little bit longer clip That's goes Johnson speaks in full sentences

468
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
Oh yeah

469
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,640
Learned his lesson

470
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
Open right now

471
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Okay

472
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,296
98% of people don't even know

473
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,136
The real parameters of power that surround them

474
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,464
Phony paradigms and systems of phony left ride

475
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:59,584
With all the roads leading towards a centralized highly controlled corporate

476
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
Bureaucracy

477
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Think of it as a kind of a footnote

478
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
You're describing is quite purpose

479
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
I'm conscious self-conscious

480
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
The Country Fest

481
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
Pickling 20th century

482
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
There has been a

483
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
Very self-conscious

484
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,488
Speculative

485
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
L say so

486
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
Business Leaders

487
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
Electrostatic

488
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
Scientists know they say

489
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Outer space

490
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Important to

491
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Public remains

492
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
Spectators

493
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Participant

494
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
They're supposed

495
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Directed to other concern

496
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
I'm not interfere with policy formation

497
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,976
Phenomenon

498
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
That's really

499
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
Find Century

500
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
And the reason was very clear

501
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,472
By the early 20th century it was becoming

502
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Difficult

503
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
People

504
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
By other means

505
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,152
Branch of the voting franchise was extending

506
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,992
Labor unions for women were

507
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
Let me know

508
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,392
Ashley England the United States

509
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
Early on

510
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Worser

511
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,120
Property or some other means you

512
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
That was used

513
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
That's what the US public relationship

514
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
Grows out of these experiences and

515
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
They develop put out their papers that I read

516
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,904
The Carnegie endowment others

517
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Mind control

518
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
Haitian is much cheaper and much more effective

519
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
And it's the only thing you can do

520
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,984
Countries you can't control people with a gun

521
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,688
Something that I think is really key here is to notice like where there is

522
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
A salient

523
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Agreement

524
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Between

525
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
And also the way that those two things

526
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
Things are fully

527
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,720
Differently understood by the two-party about the same thing

528
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
No

529
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
I think it is

530
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
Do you know what what time can you bring two

531
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
To the table he's ideas about

532
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
Wanting to keep people disengage

533
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
From some

534
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Publix

535
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Discourse

536
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
Decisions

537
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
They could be detrimental to

538
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Elite corporations

539
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
Centrist

540
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,480
I am in so much as that is in their interest then

541
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
You know

542
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Not having all information

543
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,392
Polly disseminated Works to those goals

544
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
And I didn't invent

545
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Muddying the water

546
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
I would like

547
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:14,656
Like propaganda especially the United States propaganda has been rocking that boat for a long time

548
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:20,032
Roots of advertising other than that what is social media in

549
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Influencers

550
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
Ennard a what

551
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
Any kind of publicity

552
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
A lot of that stuff is

553
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,784
Is just perception management

554
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,672
There is a real conversation that can be had and I

555
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
It's

556
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,792
You know I obviously wouldn't necessarily take this tack but someone should say

557
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
But it literally everybody was

558
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Engaged

559
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,912
In decision-making about every issue

560
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
He'll be impossible

561
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
For a society to function

562
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
And maybe

563
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
2

564
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
A limit

565
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
There is an argument that could be made for

566
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
You know people being disengaged

567
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
Is more

568
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
Is actually a better organizational model I'm not I'm not advocating that should I could see someone making that boy

569
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,696
And I can see tropski having an interesting conversation with that

570
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
On the other hand

571
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
His beliefs

572
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,352
We are so much into the vaccines are meant to make us dumb

573
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
They poison us in our food

574
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
In all this

575
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Video

576
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Even this point of agreement

577
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Is a Point of Departure

578
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
For the two of them

579
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
I find that

580
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
Very

581
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Weird looking

582
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
Yeah I mean it does sound like

583
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,296
Noam Chomsky is describing the phenomena of

584
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Government

585
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:42,976
Destroying the ability of the electorate to honestly engage with their actions

586
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
And Alex responded

587
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,608
So obviously you're talking about mind control

588
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
And I think I think

589
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
Do you know I don't have a good enough glimpse of Alex a2001 Altuve

590
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Based on

591
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Dunno.

592
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
The present day

593
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:02,944
I would guess that he means like someone putting a pendulum

594
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
Zoology

595
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Mind control

596
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Look into my spinning

597
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,160
I think so but I think it's the way you know someone like

598
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Is Castaway

599
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,232
Interactive that is taking that as metaphor

600
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
If Alex was like

601
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,704
So you're in agreement with me they're putting computer chips inside everybody's brain to make them do what they tell them to

602
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
To an old would have gone

603
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
That is

604
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Not what I'm saying at all

605
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
But I don't know what

606
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
That's what Alex is saying back at this point

607
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
That's one of the parts

608
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
There is kind of challenging about this is

609
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
You can hear that

610
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,040
From Alex even as metaphor

611
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
As flourishes speaking

612
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,464
Right as opposed to it being like I have you under my control.

613
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
That does kind of

614
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Point out

615
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
One big issue though

616
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Is that

617
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
All too often

618
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
Can we just assume people are capable of

619
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,544
Well it's interesting that he's talking to a linguist

620
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,480
Borderline the Turing test

621
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,576
What's going on it's borderline Alex trying to fool

622
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,368
Computer addiction YouTube

623
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,000
Chomsky's is shockingly charitable with Alex

624
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,120
It's to his credit is my kind size

625
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,448
Alex talks about how bush in Clint

626
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
This is going to be have to be

627
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
Yeah I guess it would be

628
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
George W bush

629
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
Cuz he just got elected

630
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,688
Has been given the boot yeah and Alex

631
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Facts about how

632
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
They're the same

633
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Keystone of very specific

634
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
6 set of accent

635
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,952
Well take Bush and Clinton they have the exact same policies

636
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,768
On land grabbing selling-out sovereignty

637
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
The industrialization

638
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656
The children

639
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
They have this

640
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
This

641
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,544
This cult like following of their parties and can't admit it's really the same

642
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
Can I call the same

643
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,616
Detroit to corporate

644
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,200
The New World Order

645
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,784
Maybe I'm naive

646
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Publix in there

647
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
My feeling is that

648
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,904
The general public is rather well aware of

649
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,072
Public opinion study

650
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
Pretty trustworthy and various

651
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,224
20 years or so

652
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
Percent of the population

653
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
When they're asked

654
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
What do you think the country

655
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
The government or what it do

656
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,024
The answer that they pick out of a set of choices is

657
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,096
The government works for the fuel in the special interest

658
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,704
Coming at this with the perspective of like

659
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Alright

660
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
A lot of people are aware

661
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,568
There's a different problem

662
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
It needs to be addressed

663
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:16,480
And that'll come up a little bit later in the interview

664
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,088
He's selected criteria upon which Clinton and Bush are the same

665
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
Is weird to me

666
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
It's

667
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Very

668
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
Suspiciously specific

669
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,840
Unfairly articulated

670
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,472
They're both land Grabbers they both children

671
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,872
And then they move on and don't wait what hold on did you see me land-grabbing I assume is code for conservation

672
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,176
Either that or eminent domain

673
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Yeah that could be at this point

674
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,368
It's huge on Alex's mine that could be could be

675
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,720
Oh and also I don't know if Bush's early record with EPA

676
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
Stanford necessarily always good

677
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,120
Drugging the children is the one that's like

678
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Okay you're just talking

679
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Sing about like

680
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:14,336
Psychiatric meds

681
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,664
Was a huge but it's not like bushes putting people up

682
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
No-bull shoe is

683
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,760
Cramming Ritalin down everybody's faces

684
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,576
I forgot the No Child Left Behind

685
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Parentheses was

686
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
With Riddler

687
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
I mean obviously I think that there is

688
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Over-prescription of

689
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
Matthew talked about that we're past

690
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Sure

691
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
I just don't know exactly what

692
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Expect Clinton or bush to Dubai

693
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
If you want to make it illegal

694
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Ted 2 take

695
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
I thought he was for

696
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Drug legalization

697
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
I see want more

698
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,200
Regulation on pharmaceutical Industries

699
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Opposite Direct

700
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,552
If you're going to get your ADHD meds

701
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,136
You should go to the corner like everybody else does with their truck

702
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,184
I think that's what he's trying to say

703
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
If it's not on the corner it's not drugs buddy

704
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
Every

705
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,888
Every other night I go down and get a fifth of whiskey on the corner I know a guy

706
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,424
So well-stocked coat

707
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,800
Where else do you think I get my Lamictal

708
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Yeah

709
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
It's it

710
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Bizarre

711
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
The end again

712
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,016
I think that really illustrates the sort of surface-level and cherry pick

713
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Way in which Alex

714
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
Describes the similarity between the

715
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
YouTube absolute

716
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
I think I

717
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,512
Largely agree with chomsky's analysis that

718
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
More

719
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Groundbreak

720
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
King stuff

721
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Did event

722
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
People

723
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Have an alienation

724
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
From Power solutely

725
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
Random person on the street

726
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,384
You think it's the government or our corporate overlords

727
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
And they'll be like

728
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
Going to go with corporate overlords

729
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
Not surprising to anyone

730
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,648
There's a shift propaganda that Alex has been

731
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Been feeling

732
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,208
Over the last few years

733
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
This is weird

734
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
To hear in 2001 because he says this

735
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
Timbuktu later years to

736
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
But there's been a shift recently

737
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,984
Over the last few years

738
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,032
Anything secret about the globalist

739
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
Throwing it in your face

740
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,408
And Chomsky is brought up the idea of hopeless

741
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Hopelessness

742
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Either response

743
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,880
But people can have to the idea that the government isn't necessarily serving their interests and that is a larger

744
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
That actually

745
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Some of the other

746
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Things that Alex

747
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
Bring up helplessness leads to Hope

748
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,632
I am so Alex is suggesting that this is this shift

749
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Propaganda

750
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,960
From hiding the globalist

751
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,496
To throw it in your face

752
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,544
Is a way of facilitating the total

753
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
That does not go in for that

754
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,736
I've seen a shift in the propaganda the last three years from denying all of this

755
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
Just rolling it North Face

756
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
I am feeling is the roots go back

757
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,168
Really takes off

758
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,008
Screw on the basis of the

759
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
Sensible assumption that was

760
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,616
Free clearly articulated

761
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Does not make

762
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
Democratic

763
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
Fraternities are available

764
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
And leaves us to run

765
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,720
And the way to do it was

766
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,304
Leaders are saying we have to

767
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
APU

768
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,472
We have two people to

769
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,824
Superficial things like fashionable consumption

770
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:07,040
Bread and circuses

771
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
Figure in the US

772
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
Elite media

773
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
He's the one who

774
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
And that is a phrase manufacturer

775
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
And he thought it was necessary

776
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
In order to

777
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
Make sure that we

778
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
Responsible men

779
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,152
I can run the Affairs of the world

780
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
And what they didn't say but what is

781
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Personalize your

782
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,112
The people Beeb, responsible man if you're serving the interests

783
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Concentrated price

784
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
2

785
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,512
He's talking about a position

786
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
And an idea

787
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
He's able to bring up

788
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,960
The people who are the proponents of the opposite of his idea

789
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
He's able to engage

790
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
With this

791
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
How much more thorough weigh

792
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Even in the matter of a minute

793
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,432
Then then Alex is over ever able to

794
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
Strange to hear somebody talk on this show

795
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
And then be like

796
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Wow

797
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,440
Really thought

798
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
Good work man

799
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Good work

800
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
Yeah

801
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,448
I don't even know what to like what to respond with

802
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:34,848
It's just like about these issues but

803
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
Noam Chomsky

804
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,736
I feel like that's what I'm learning from all of this is that somehow

805
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,064
I'll see if people can harass him on Twitter

806
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
F****** Jones gets to talk to Noam Chomsky

807
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
And he doesn't get to listen to me s*** talk him

808
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Wally's explaining the world today

809
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Well

810
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,120
And that is a life is unfair sometimes

811
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
It is so I typed

812
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
This is this is one of the things that makes this

813
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
Kind of difficult

814
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,080
To really even engage with too deeply as

815
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Contact

816
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
Jeremiah

817
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
And is that

818
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
I think

819
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
You can see why

820
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Jobs be saying

821
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
Articulating positions

822
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,832
Yeah clearly I think we're buddy

823
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,184
You know there's some stuff that I maybe don't entirely agree with

824
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
B b b

825
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
It would be the matter of

826
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Teasing

827
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
In-N-Out points

828
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,144
To really get to the bottom of like okay well

829
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
You know

830
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Yes

831
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,752
There is an interest

832
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
In

833
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Media in

834
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Gavin people

835
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
Consumed with

836
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Superficial

837
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
Short course

838
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
How much of that is

839
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Intentional

840
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,136
Strategy driven by people who want people to be distracted

841
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
And how much of that is

842
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,328
Actively that is what people want their is a market

843
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
It for that

844
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Do you know people are feeling that market

845
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
What is the balance by

846
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
Between the two

847
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,032
Yeah I mean it would be hard to argue that the best

848
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
Example of that very thing we

849
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Would be Trump's tweet

850
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
Constantly covering Trump

851
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,016
They almost ensured he would at least

852
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
I have a run it happen

853
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Rashad it become

854
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
President

855
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
At the same time

856
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:27,488
If the public weren't so consumed and so interested it with

857
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,816
With discovering more and more about his dumb

858
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Wait yeah

859
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
Then they wouldn't be copper

860
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
You know

861
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:38,240
Mm2 to this question particularly

862
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,264
About what

863
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,336
But he's bringing up about the media and

864
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,152
Do you know what Alex yells bread and circuses with

865
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
He's

866
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
There's a supply component

867
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Demands component

868
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,064
Ignore either

869
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
I think is

870
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,880
Is not the full picture

871
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,184
And I don't think the chomsky's ignoring

872
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,256
Picture of this conversation

873
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,888
That would be the kind of way I would approach this and I

874
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
The agency makes points

875
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:11,776
Are the points

876
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
Is he had a perfect opportunity

877
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Opportunity

878
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
Cut into Noam Chomsky and be like

879
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,456
Actually I think it goes further back then

880
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
That

881
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,808
To roam red and circuses mr. Chow

882
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:33,280
Your phone now are you alright no could I tell you about that

883
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
Bavarian Illuminati

884
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
I'd like to tell you

885
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,168
Bucked up ideas I have about

886
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
About

887
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
The Illuminati

888
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
I think I think that

889
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
You know John's Keys able to make point

890
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
And so it

891
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,040
It's a foreign concept on Infowars

892
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,112
Aubrey brings up the difference of opinion

893
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
Between the

894
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,440
Sort of elite corporations

895
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,720
And the

896
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
Normal

897
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,304
Person who has a job perhaps in terms of

898
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
The free trade

899
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,144
Okay for the public

900
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,008
Are these International economic agreement

901
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
The trade deficit

902
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,136
40%

903
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
No I'm not

904
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,520
They're also big issues for the business world

905
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,919
Therefore the issues do not arrive

906
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Political campaign

907
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,111
Agreement very little Water Country

908
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Negotiate

909
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,071
Coming to the Americas meeting in

910
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
Anthony mansion

911
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
Negotiation for a couple years

912
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
Managers by trade ministers

913
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
Governments or basic

914
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Potato

915
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,703
Things are still team to be going fairly well.

916
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,031
Between get on board with

917
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,103
Now maybe Alex would view this as

918
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Is the consequence

919
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
An elaborate Shady can

920
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Conspiracy

921
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:04,831
To put this trade deal in in order to enslave white man or something

922
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,671
Where is Chomsky would look at it more as the result of business interest

923
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,791
You know those filters that are brought up in the propaganda model things like

924
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
Ownership of a conglomerate

925
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,959
The sources of news the

926
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,799
Advertising revenues

927
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,615
Things like that create a market environment where

928
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,151
It's not in the best interest

929
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,711
You know people who made profit

930
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
From

931
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
One of these Arrangements

932
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
To cover it

933
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
Too much

934
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,855
If it if it's something that could

935
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Be something that would be very unpopular with

936
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
Subnormal voting Pub

937
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:46,047
One thing I am absolutely seeing that is

938
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Mitigating what I would

939
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Think with so much

940
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Disagreement

941
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,959
Is that Chomsky is elucidating the

942
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,799
Conspiracies that are real that we all know about

943
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
You know like

944
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
We all know that billionaires in the government's work

945
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
Work together to f*** us over

946
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
That's a normal conspiracy

947
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,039
That's what they do and it's not even like

948
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,391
It's not even like their fault they're just creations of the system that is

949
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
Chopping them up and then they

950
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
Continue to

951
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
They do that whole thing

952
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,095
But since he's framing it in that conspiratorial like

953
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
These

954
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,935
Business interests and the government are all working

955
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Sing together

956
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
The fuk is over

957
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
That can

958
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Viewed by Alex

959
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,871
In the same way that the metaphor could be viewed by

960
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
Right right

961
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,503
Oh you're absolutely right there is a conspiracy of

962
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,855
The Rothschild had the government to focus over with the

963
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
Yeah there's enough leeway to this

964
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,719
Was that that Alex

965
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
Can still find it

966
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
Useful

967
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,863
Maybe they want to read into it

968
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,167
It's the sort of Infowars

969
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,727
Narrative structure

970
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,311
Where is it does not necessarily and it's

971
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,431
But a lot more boring than the way that Alex would push

972
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
Batman you can

973
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,039
Absolutely see it like in 2001

974
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,087
That level of like

975
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
Because the government is so f******

976
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
Corrupt

977
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,255
Because Alex is an outright saying he's fighting the devil

978
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,839
You can go on in the Infowars Show & Save the government's f******

979
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,191
Kurupt kurupt and everybody goes

980
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
Incorruptible in 20 years later you're like

981
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
Let's overthrow the government and it's like

982
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,455
Because they're working for the devil

983
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:45,087
Real sweet spot pre 9/11 but

984
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Post

985
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
2000 election

986
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
So much

987
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,767
Que hacen alienation in people

988
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,071
The results of the 2000 election

989
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Turn was such

990
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
A

991
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,655
Awful

992
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,447
I mean he was literally stolen

993
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,799
It was a moment

994
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
Where scales fell from people's eyes

995
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
Waterways

996
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
Across the aisle

997
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,527
Perhaps even this is the way that our process is going through this

998
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
This doesn't feel right Ru telling me that process

999
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
Has been derailed by

1000
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Fake Republic by Republica

1001
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,351
Can a fake dressing up as business people

1002
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,423
What are we doing this our government is this how it works

1003
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
Yeah

1004
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
You had you had that.

1005
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,615
Before 9/11 where people were all over the map

1006
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
In terms of

1007
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Their beliefs

1008
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
About

1009
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
The administration

1010
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,807
Totally people galvanized a lot after 9/11

1011
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,855
Coming together

1012
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
After a national tragedy

1013
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,439
Forever

1014
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
Dennis exist

1015
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,255
In that space before that

1016
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
Where there is

1017
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,399
You know there's a lot of fertile ground for Alex to take advantage of

1018
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
In political disillusioned

1019
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Yeah

1020
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
And so I think

1021
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
No

1022
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
You know I'm Fortune

1023
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Smelly butt

1024
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
I don't think he knows too much about Alex

1025
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,759
And just thinks that he is kind of like an alternative news guy

1026
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
Yeah and

1027
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,599
He eat he says things like

1028
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,415
You know Outlets like yours are in Port

1029
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,511
Right I think that that is a perception that even

1030
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,583
You know I certainly wish I had more of a feeling of

1031
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,119
4 years ago

1032
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,935
Cuz I you know there is there is a

1033
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
There's a reality that

1034
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
People who are outside of the

1035
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,823
The structures of advertising

1036
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,615
Those voices are important

1037
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
And sometimes

1038
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,919
There is value in somebody

1039
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Who's

1040
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
You know

1041
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,063
Maybe wrong sometimes but willing to take a chance

1042
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,623
I think those voices are valuable in the broads

1043
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
Spectrum of

1044
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Of

1045
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Media

1046
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
Totally I mean

1047
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,023
Chomsky's earlier point

1048
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,655
Like if you recalled the media immediately following that stolen election

1049
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
Like they

1050
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,799
Quickly were like a you know what we need to do tonight around our President we need the country to come together

1051
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,383
At no point in time where they like hey we can't have a stolen election

1052
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Can't

1053
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Be a thing

1054
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,783
Yeah yeah and I guess that opens up another conversation of like

1055
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
What would it look like

1056
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,927
If the media had called out the Killer

1057
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Leaving that aside

1058
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,303
I think the chompski has a similar tack

1059
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
2

1060
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
You know what I had

1061
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:43,007
Perhaps before I knew as much about Alex's I do and I think a lot of people if they don't know all that much about him which is just like

1062
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
Euro

1063
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
Guy who's

1064
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:51,455
It was on the outside your guy or are you bringing me and Grover whatever maybe I don't know

1065
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,783
Free with you but there's value in you existing in the media Llano game

1066
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:01,183
And I don't agree with that now that he's engaging with him

1067
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
Radios can be very

1068
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
Instrument

1069
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
There can be

1070
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Involvement

1071
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,447
Highly important educational instrument of their others I mean

1072
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
Nothing that I mention

1073
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,599
Newest Logan and say okay that's what I

1074
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
That's essentially Alec

1075
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
Responding

1076
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,935
To know times you think you can't use sound bites

1077
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,471
And catch phrases with

1078
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,775
More less and a catchphrase yeah

1079
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
Man

1080
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,103
So you're telling me that

1081
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Noam Chomsky

1082
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
Told Alex Jones that he's important

1083
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,735
And Noam Chomsky won't even talk

1084
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,831
That's just bulshit it just b******* it's unfair

1085
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,647
Noam Chomsky I'm calling you out

1086
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,183
But again again

1087
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,767
If you don't know that much about Alex you don't actually list

1088
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,839
Some to his show and I said I don't know too much about

1089
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,119
Exactly what you would like

1090
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
Making 2001

1091
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:20,031
You see there's another area residents career to if you don't know all that much about him

1092
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
You could get the sense that like

1093
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Yeah

1094
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,175
You're not doing

1095
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:33,087
You are getting into the issue is the value of radio I do agree with Chomsky on that

1096
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Not Alex

1097
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,999
Get along pretty well they both seem to hate

1098
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Consumerism

1099
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
$50

1100
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,911
Nike tennis shoes that are so ugly I wouldn't

1101
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
For free

1102
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
My grandchildren

1103
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
I went there

1104
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,711
Subjected to is

1105
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,623
Teaching them from infancy that the only thing in life

1106
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Getting those

1107
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,207
Tennis shoes

1108
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
Or whatever maybe

1109
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
People winner in a variable

1110
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
It's a hard struggle

1111
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,055
Consumerism is a toxic influence

1112
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:29,407
I don't know what what's the answer to it it's an individual process

1113
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,991
It can't be like outlawing adver

1114
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,295
Advertises know that probably won't work

1115
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:41,695
I would say one solution would obviously be to scorched

1116
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,767
The skies and have an AI keep us inside of

1117
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,815
That would be

1118
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
Lucian certainly

1119
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,703
Although even then the AI has propaganda inside of its side

1120
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
Me and you're never going to escape

1121
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,055
No don't let the only way

1122
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
This is productive as a conversation

1123
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Is addressing

1124
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,895
It has an individualistic

1125
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,455
Pursuit recognizing when

1126
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,247
Those kind of advertising

1127
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Checks are being used

1128
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,599
Right I don't actually want that as much as

1129
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,927
I am saying I want it or maybe I do

1130
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,255
Sure you know like advertising I think they'd sometimes

1131
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Is

1132
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,047
Dumb

1133
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,095
But I actually do want with being sold

1134
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
I don't like Taco Bell commercials but I

1135
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,239
I do want Taco Bell. All I want is

1136
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
Like I'm so stoked when I find out something exists that I didn't know exist like commercials were just

1137
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
Hey

1138
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,527
You need to wash your clothes tide I'd be like all these yet I didn't know tide was out there

1139
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,319
Yes you did that's not the point

1140
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,719
That's not the point I mean that experience was exactly what I had at the beginning of April when I saw the commercial for Mortal Kombat

1141
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:54,911
Dad will watch Mortal Kombat commercial is not going to convince me one way or another you're informing me that the

1142
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:59,263
That's all I needed to know ya

1143
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,383
But I think I think that people can do that be very capable of doing

1144
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
And I think that that is what the message

1145
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,295
The chomsky's bringing in many ways is thinking is

1146
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
Is recognizing

1147
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,903
And being able to work around these things

1148
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
Can't really stop them

1149
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,511
And the fact that you can't stop them

1150
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,303
Is what feeds into helper

1151
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
You can't

1152
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
Get rid of advertising

1153
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,167
You're not going to get rid of

1154
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Public relations firm

1155
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
That isn't going

1156
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
Going to happen

1157
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,335
Because I'm even think about it just from a structural

1158
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
Actual perspect

1159
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
How would that happen

1160
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
How could you do that

1161
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,247
Legislate away

1162
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
Those kinds of

1163
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,343
It would be impossible.

1164
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
Turn all the electricity

1165
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,439
Sure then people would just make pants

1166
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,743
Once again I couldn't do it without

1167
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
Electricity to run their printer

1168
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,375
No they just go back to the the old chunk

1169
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,423
Get rid of it get rid of press

1170
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,471
Get rid of ink get rid of ink

1171
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
Wow you're good

1172
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,847
I think the path away from

1173
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
Helplessness

1174
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
That I'm hearing

1175
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Is

1176
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,223
Self-motivated self-driven

1177
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,831
Ways that intellectuals and public speakers can be of help

1178
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,879
Is helping people recognized

1179
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
That is a path

1180
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,207
This conundrum

1181
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
As opposed to

1182
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
Institution

1183
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
Things you can do like perhaps

1184
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,607
Breakup large media entities

1185
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Certainly there's

1186
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,191
There's this organization and things you can do

1187
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:32,959
On that front

1188
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
But

1189
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
The idea of

1190
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Getting rid of

1191
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,615
Influence that is this negative consumerism

1192
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
He's not like

1193
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,479
No that's that is a yeah it's not going back in the box

1194
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
Pandora

1195
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,087
This makes Cooper's really weird

1196
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,903
I don't understand exactly what Alex is saying but I have some

1197
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Some thoughts on

1198
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,023
At 1

1199
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
Crucial part of

1200
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
Is to take

1201
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
Circle service

1202
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
I'm handing over to private

1203
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Power

1204
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
Services are

1205
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:06,751
People with

1206
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
Health education

1207
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,639
Water

1208
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:19,551
A man unlike any other

1209
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,231
Put into private hands unaccountable private hands

1210
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
What's left for the public is

1211
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
What is private

1212
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,751
Take a lower Colorado River Authority here in Texas

1213
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
CR record

1214
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
That's right

1215
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:57,439
I think they would Alex is talking about is the the lower Colorado River Authority

1216
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,511
Is is like you know like damn

1217
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
Yeah like

1218
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Lecture

1219
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Power plant

1220
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
Regards

1221
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:10,239
Around the area

1222
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,031
Private security

1223
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
But

1224
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
What were Trump's key bringing up

1225
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Is privatization

1226
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Accentuate

1227
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,223
And Alex has opposed to that but he also hates big government

1228
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,015
Where is chomsky's answer to this is

1229
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Is public ownership

1230
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,135
An hour to be staunchly opposed to the bat

1231
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,927
He doesn't Publix Lyon Abyss

1232
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,463
He doesn't have

1233
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,255
A coherent answer to this

1234
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
Because on the one hand

1235
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,095
You have public

1236
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
Business

1237
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,911
This is our private business is

1238
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
Should you allow private

1239
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Business

1240
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
Referred necessities

1241
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,127
Should you allow air to be privatized would you allow water to

1242
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
To be privatized

1243
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,711
Alex should be

1244
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,271
Opposed to that but also opposed to the alternative

1245
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,623
Alex has a clear way out of his b*******

1246
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,183
Whenever cornered by

1247
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Noam Chomsky

1248
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
So what you do is you awake

1249
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,143
And Alex tries to bring up

1250
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,191
The difference between a democracy and a republic

1251
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,263
This is opal classic right wing

1252
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
Between a democracy and a

1253
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,383
Republic

1254
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,431
Gnome

1255
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Can I read that

1256
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
What's the name again

1257
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,319
Noam Chomsky all that's who I would do it

1258
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,367
I wouldn't know that other guy

1259
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:35,231
It doesn't go well and I would say this is the turning point

1260
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Of the interview

1261
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,071
This is where things go we're on thin ice

1262
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,655
Republicans Democrats saying democracy that's a semantical.

1263
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,495
Is horrible it's two wolves

1264
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,543
Tennessee voting on what's for dinner

1265
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,615
A republic

1266
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
Bill of Rights

1267
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,175
You can't violate

1268
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
Democracy

1269
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223
50%

1270
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Take that far

1271
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,647
Right there I mean

1272
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,743
We hear this work democracy all the time but we're Republican there's a big difference

1273
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
Actually I

1274
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,071
Surreal

1275
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,607
Elsewhere

1276
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,655
Republic

1277
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,191
Democracy

1278
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Not really

1279
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,567
Founding fathers what they were concerned about James Madison

1280
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,663
But he was concerned about Buddy wanted to have a

1281
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,247
In which power would lie in the hands of

1282
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,527
But he called the wealth of

1283
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,855
The more capable

1284
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,207
Because the goal of government

1285
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
This phrase

1286
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,583
Protect the minority of the opulent

1287
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
To ensure

1288
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Cruel

1289
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,847
I'm at the general public would be fragmented and marginalized

1290
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,711
Middle class

1291
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
Flourish

1292
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
Spell that's

1293
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
Now that's not coming

1294
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:19,679
So Alex is having trouble now because gnome has pointed a finger at the

1295
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Founders

1296
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
Yasso

1297
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,639
Call Alex robots that a middle-class flourish

1298
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
Tear

1299
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
And

1300
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,967
Because of right-wing policies

1301
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,271
I have evidence of it is that

1302
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,599
4% of the population of the world and we had half of the well

1303
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
Yeah right

1304
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
I think jobs he doesn't

1305
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
Understand what he said

1306
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,559
Cuz he's at 4% isn't the middle class

1307
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,191
If he heard Alex and 4% of our population had half of the wealth

1308
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,239
Then that would be the response

1309
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,519
That would be given

1310
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,103
Yeah I still think even if you'd accurately heard what Alex said

1311
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,175
I still think it what are you saying is accurate

1312
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:06,271
That the 4% that had all the wealth wasn't necessarily the middle class

1313
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:11,391
May I ask they were very much nothing middle-class on account of there were only

1314
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,671
4% of 3

1315
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,487
4% is 4% of the world

1316
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
World's population

1317
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,327
Oh yeah yeah

1318
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,399
So you leave the 4% beside

1319
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:27,263
Even if we did have half the wealth it wasn't like evenly distributed

1320
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Among

1321
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
The population

1322
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,127
There may have been a fairly comfortable

1323
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
Middle class

1324
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,503
Yeah I would argue the slave

1325
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
Population

1326
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
Probably wasn't

1327
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
And taken care of

1328
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Yeah

1329
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
So this

1330
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,351
Issue with the founding father

1331
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Is the

1332
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Beginning of

1333
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,959
What is going to become a tear in the fabric of French

1334
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
Sure

1335
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,007
We have

1336
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
This

1337
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Conversation

1338
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
Italians are going to guns

1339
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,967
Cuz of course

1340
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,991
Almost immediately

1341
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
Over the centuries

1342
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,719
The options Republic

1343
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,447
That's not what they meant

1344
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,031
Second Amendment

1345
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:36,127
Open contacts

1346
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
Bear arms

1347
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,967
We're living in a different world racing malicious

1348
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,783
Are the question whether people should have arms is a

1349
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
International Society

1350
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,743
000000

1351
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,535
No did you just say

1352
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:59,935
No

1353
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,263
Neighbors

1354
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,663
Gnome you have hit a very dangerous but me and you can't undo this now you have just told Alex

1355
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,479
His interpretation of the Second Amendment is wrong new world

1356
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759
New world

1357
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
Ono turns out

1358
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Noam Chomsky the shell

1359
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391
The United States has

1360
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
Spectre movie

1361
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
International Society

1362
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:27,583
Do you think people are hopeful you helpful that folks going to wake up

1363
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
People

1364
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:34,751
Again

1365
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,543
That what they feel is help

1366
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,359
To be able to overcome that feeling as hell

1367
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,223
People have organized they have struggle

1368
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,295
David Chief rights we have all kinds of Rights

1369
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Exist

1370
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
Not long ago

1371
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,647
MSB cursive

1372
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Learn

1373
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
Educate

1374
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
Change the world

1375
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,287
We're very privileged we live in a society where

1376
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,591
Penalty for not controlled by force

1377
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,639
Extremely important

1378
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:18,271
Honestly and I really appreciate coming along to tell folks about some your Publications and let you get back to work

1379
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,111
Right there it seemed like a groupthink

1380
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:27,487
Mechanism

1381
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,327
I think America the US has no author from

1382
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
Get out of the main line

1383
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
The rest of the world

1384
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,215
As if I were little

1385
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
Zoe's

1386
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,127
Alex is trying to express this notion that

1387
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:48,735
Are you trying to shame America about guns based on the

1388
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,039
Notion that the rest of the world is

1389
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,623
Is more civilized they don't have guns

1390
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Is

1391
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
Out at this is just

1392
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,999
Galaxy is decided that if you

1393
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,815
Present that kind of position on his show

1394
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
Your f****** s***

1395
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
Alex throws out

1396
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
Literally

1397
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,495
A great degree of agreement

1398
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,775
Oh yeah I know it's all gone

1399
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:18,943
What could have led to a second interview probably could have led to

1400
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,735
I mean eventually would fall apart

1401
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:26,879
There wasn't hostility here there was someone who has a different

1402
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,439
Perspective on some of the similar themes

1403
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
That Alex talks about

1404
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,303
No I I mean with the moments

1405
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,863
Gnome said we live in a

1406
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Country where you can't

1407
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
Control people by force

1408
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,471
All I saw in my head was Alex

1409
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
Pulling a gun and saying

1410
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,567
You take that back

1411
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,407
Guns are not about Force there by politeness

1412
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
So

1413
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,807
I even that

1414
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
Groupthink

1415
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Even though

1416
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
Trump is pretty generous in

1417
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
And measured with his response

1418
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,007
True but if you want my opinion

1419
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,127
Took all the guns

1420
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,735
Hickory high crime

1421
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
It's been

1422
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,463
Real difference between the United

1423
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,327
So it seems like

1424
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,863
Chomsky

1425
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
Just ignoring

1426
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Alex's

1427
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,959
Obviously misrepresented stats

1428
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
No and he's framing

1429
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,079
The conversation where he believes

1430
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
Is it more important

1431
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,615
Witches dance

1432
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,639
Scott Gunn.

1433
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,175
Which is

1434
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
Out of pace

1435
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,503
Swift other industrialized countries

1436
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,039
Alex

1437
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,575
The come at him with that b*******

1438
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
Doesn't seem like Adele

1439
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,743
He might be the first ones might be the first person who comes with this though

1440
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,543
Country

1441
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,359
Australia number one and two now

1442
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
10 deaths by gun

1443
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,711
Yes now they are

1444
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,271
London is now more dangerous

1445
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
4 years ago

1446
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,623
It's now

1447
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,927
Eyeworks in Washington d.c. sir

1448
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,815
I have University

1449
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:47,167
Salon

1450
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,983
Infowars.com

1451
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,519
Take a look

1452
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,871
The reason is

1453
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,431
That there has been an increased availability

1454
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,247
Availability

1455
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
You're right

1456
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,367
Sir

1457
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,119
A always have fun

1458
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
In England

1459
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,543
Even the police

1460
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,567
We're not armed

1461
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:33,247
The police didn't have guns the people have handguns

1462
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
That's a different story

1463
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,031
That is a we're done here

1464
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
Your publication

1465
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:04,479
If there's more availability of guns

1466
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,599
I see I think that there's a really not

1467
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,647
Not bizarre at all very

1468
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,207
4 into Infowars situation

1469
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,255
I'm going on where he's talking to a person

1470
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
Who is is

1471
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
Saying

1472
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,655
That they were talking about glitches

1473
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
Deaths by gun

1474
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
Alex's fudging

1475
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Statistics

1476
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
Making stuff up

1477
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:31,871
You brought up a different issue I'm going to have to let you go

1478
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,175
Monkeys doing

1479
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,223
Is being overly charity

1480
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,295
He's not saying Alex you're a f****** liar

1481
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
Filmmaking

1482
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,367
Stop up you think I would need to take a look at that

1483
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
If that is

1484
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,743
The case here is a potential explanation for why that could be the case

1485
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
And then Alex is taking them

1486
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Pental explanation

1487
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,607
The chompski has 4/8

1488
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,631
Fictitious stats

1489
01:08:55,423 --> 01:09:01,567
Explanation for his fictitious I think I would have said something along the lines of if

1490
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
Australia are one and two in gun deaths I will eat a bowl of my own s*** you idiot

1491
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
I will take that back

1492
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,879
He's doing the Firearms Amendment Act of 1997

1493
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,695
Not in England with your past

1494
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:22,815
In response to the dunblane massacre where a man in his forties carried out a mass shooting at a primary school

1495
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:27,679
The strategy employed was not to confiscate guns but to ban future ownership of mos

1496
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,447
Ghost guns

1497
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:32,031
And let the valid licenses that were active laps and not be renewed

1498
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,639
In response a ton of people voluntarily turned in their guns and Alex's pretending that's account

1499
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
Station

1500
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,503
It did make more guns illegal to own

1501
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,319
It's a pretty strict rules about guns

1502
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,855
In England predata

1503
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,671
He's not far off

1504
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
No it's it

1505
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,999
Alex could get him on a technicality

1506
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,047
If you saying that all guns

1507
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
I've always been a legal right

1508
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,911
Roller or whatever but spiritually he's he's not

1509
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
He's not off

1510
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
No

1511
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,519
Now

1512
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
That

1513
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
Hasn't happened

1514
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Alex

1515
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Besides

1516
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,175
I think I'm going to hang up on this day

1517
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:14,271
Really appreciate you just say this one big part of controlling

1518
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Their system

1519
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,743
Is having people out there

1520
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:29,887
Propaganda

1521
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:37,567
And frankly sir you need to get the information on the guns on the land grabbing all of it because I have it

1522
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
Lightyear

1523
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,639
And I respect your work

1524
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
I just hear talk

1525
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,647
Certainly is

1526
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,231
How did Rockefeller for me

1527
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,279
Wow

1528
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
What a dick

1529
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,935
Sweet dick

1530
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,471
Now

1531
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,311
I've bizarre and to this

1532
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,591
Interview

1533
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,479
Excuse me for about an hour but it turns out that you disagree with me on gun so

1534
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:21,343
You work for David Rockefeller do you lying piece of s*** I hope you die I hope you die

1535
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:26,207
Click that I think is really admirable is

1536
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:31,071
A response to that like

1537
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:31,839
Figure that out

1538
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,143
I'm not getting gauge with your

1539
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,703
Attempt to get you to fight with you or whatever

1540
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
Exactly I like that

1541
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,287
Excuse me Alex

1542
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,103
You realize I'm gnome Trump

1543
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,431
Didn't even go up at all

1544
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
Nope

1545
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,783
I think I figure controlled opposition in a real dick

1546
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,159
Little Liar well I understand your point of view I think people will be smart enough

1547
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,183
To look into it and

1548
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
The difference here

1549
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
And Noam Chomsky

1550
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,303
You're wrong button

1551
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,583
You're busted

1552
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,375
So now that he's gone

1553
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,655
Now we got to talk

1554
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
Oh yeah oh yeah

1555
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:14,335
Chomsky ladies and gentlemen and I read his books and now I'm more sure than ever

1556
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,151
Inside down the other

1557
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,295
Play motor Tinley

1558
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
I mean how many

1559
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
I mean you've seen the video

1560
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,887
Problem cutting the guns and half over there, skating the handguns or rifles

1561
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,471
Three years ago we've read the reports The Economist WorldNetDaily

1562
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,543
Yasemin is just speak freely once he's gone

1563
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,823
I've read his book

1564
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
Now I know for sure

1565
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,175
No idea to get him in there

1566
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,247
And then find something to disagree with

1567
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,855
And then declare him a shelf it has to have been because he has to like

1568
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,439
If it is what I was saying is Trudy's read books

1569
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,767
And suspected that he wasn't in wotl

1570
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,631
I have to be like I'm just looking for a point of disagreement in order to make you an anime

1571
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,935
That's not that's not cool

1572
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:17,823
Suggested that when he was talking about one of the books that you supposed

1573
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,591
Simply Red

1574
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,407
Would be the time to say that

1575
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,175
Hey I think

1576
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,807
Yeah I don't like your position on Auntie, exactly

1577
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
I love my favorite

1578
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,183
People are the anti-communist as hell

1579
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
Yeah

1580
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Dumb

1581
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
I thought that this

1582
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,351
Was really strange

1583
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,167
Alex

1584
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
I don't

1585
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,543
I don't know what he was doing

1586
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,639
I'm completely perplexed

1587
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,175
There's so much Abreva

1588
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Yeah

1589
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:00,063
Now I would have to give up a lot of the turtle more fun elements of his

1590
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
Conspiratorial

1591
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
Nonsense

1592
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,391
If you were to

1593
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,927
Continue engaging with John

1594
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,231
Because that stuff would fall apart

1595
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,303
A lot of it would in some of the

1596
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
The more real

1597
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
Sort of dynamic

1598
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,399
Make the chop speaker bring to

1599
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
To the table

1600
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,983
Are not necessarily as

1601
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,543
Exciting or lucrative

1602
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,615
Maybe there isn't value

1603
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,687
In it for Alex to be an ally of John Prine

1604
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:34,111
No I'm making hard for me to imagine that he did this interview as a trap in order to create this moment at the end

1605
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,647
Yeah

1606
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,951
It just doesn't make sense now

1607
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
It really doesn't

1608
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,511
It also doesn't

1609
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,071
Feel angry enough for it to be like a visceral

1610
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,863
Response on Alex's part where you just like

1611
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,655
F*** it I'm just mad at this guy

1612
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,983
I mean it kind of feels like

1613
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,543
If if I were running

1614
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
Here would be my

1615
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,407
Kind of game plan there which is

1616
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,431
If

1617
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,247
You and Noam Chomsky have an awesome interview

1618
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:04,063
Then you get to say no Chomsky is a

1619
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Fan of yours

1620
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,367
And that legitimate

1621
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
Is you

1622
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:13,023
To a lot of people it would help Alex's arguments of going to being above the left right but

1623
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,583
If you get into a fight with Noam Chomsky

1624
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
You got into a fight

1625
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
With no f***

1626
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:24,031
People will be like hell yeah

1627
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,359
Who's in this scenario I do that I do think that

1628
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
The

1629
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,151
Extreme right

1630
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
Elements

1631
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,943
About this audio

1632
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,479
Which is certainly

1633
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,015
More of the

1634
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,807
The Keystone of it

1635
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
I'm sure then

1636
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Then anything

1637
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,671
Would not like the idea of being

1638
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
Friends with no job

1639
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
Totally

1640
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:50,399
I honestly I've listened to this interview a couple times and I don't really know exactly what happened

1641
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,191
I'm not sure

1642
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,727
It makes no sense to me

1643
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,567
There's a decent chance that we saw there with him

1644
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:04,223
Being like sir you know I believe that this is a group thinking you know I think that you're not being as honest

1645
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,247
Maybe that's

1646
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,039
2001 angry Alex

1647
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:07,807
Could be

1648
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:13,951
You know like maybe we're just judging it based on the bombastic performances of gas that maybe

1649
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,511
Maybe that's how he wasn't angry dick back then

1650
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:23,679
How many years did he been doing this not long

1651
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,727
Mediocre at comedy for 7 years

1652
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,799
So you can imagine it him being

1653
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,359
You know right out the gate the bombastic

1654
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:35,199
Disgusting human being that we expect today

1655
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,551
Antabuse

1656
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
Globalist and hot tubs of snowflake

1657
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
Created

1658
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,695
The character that is

1659
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:51,327
Yeah I don't know anyway

1660
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
Really

1661
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:53,887
Really

1662
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,679
You're a new world order shell

1663
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,287
Both arms tied behind my back

1664
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
Make sense

1665
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,943
It makes me want to puke

1666
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
I might not have been the

1667
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,927
Right thing for him to mock

1668
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,231
Yeah they

1669
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,767
Only human

1670
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,095
So they definitely wanted to protect

1671
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,399
Owning human

1672
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
Yeah

1673
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,215
I think that

1674
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:32,031
If you take anything away from this date

1675
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,055
It's Alex's

1676
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,079
Contention

1677
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:36,895
And that he has more brains with both hands tied behind his back

1678
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,711
Banned completely meaningless Bragg

1679
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,783
Really it really couldn't get

1680
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:47,391
More obviously incongruous for someone to say look how smart I am

1681
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:54,047
I'm going to use a cliche that could not less apply to the very thing that I'm saying I'm

1682
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,119
Yeah I think that really kind of sums it up

1683
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,911
Strategically it even

1684
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
Thumbs up

1685
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,471
What would I look at

1686
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,567
There are very few times that I take

1687
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
You know I look

1688
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,407
Look at something that happened at Alex's past

1689
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
And I'm just

1690
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
Completely flummoxed

1691
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,759
Staff and I really don't know

1692
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
Why this happen

1693
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,087
No

1694
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,623
It's confusing

1695
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
I don't know

1696
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,255
I don't think I have any answers I would like

1697
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,559
Text know how the booker got

1698
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Nope

1699
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,167
Or people are more gettable than we think

1700
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:31,935
That's probably

1701
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,263
I think that a lot of folks that you might want to talk to

1702
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,311
It would just be a matter of a couple email

1703
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,359
Yeah I mean considering

1704
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,199
How much free time I could make

1705
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:50,111
At the drop of a hat in public intellectuals are in a very similar maybe a little bit the last for your time

1706
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,487
The Paragon everytime Jordan

1707
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,303
Yeah I think

1708
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,375
I think about how it differently history could have gone if

1709
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,935
Alex and no became Buddies

1710
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
And instead of Steve pieczenik

1711
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,663
You're not going to make it as many big swings from nowakowski

1712
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,735
I believe you're just not do you came into the fold in 2000

1713
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:23,135
This is 2,000 we got to get a new number

1714
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,975
If the infinite universes is real

1715
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,791
There is a universe is Multiverse Theory

1716
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,607
Where is Steve pieczenik is played by

1717
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,399
The Alex Jones Show

1718
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:37,471
How does that go do you think Noam Chomsky gets crazier Alex

1719
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,239
Gets less crazy

1720
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
I mean if you go

1721
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,591
Solely based on this interview

1722
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
Sure I think I was

1723
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,151
Skip less crazy

1724
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,967
Because to be Trump deceived immovable

1725
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:53,599
He's got a 120 over 80 all day

1726
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
He does not see

1727
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,415
Seem to care too much is willing

1728
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,951
To loosen a position

1729
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,743
And clarify things

1730
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,791
Well just got some pics without

1731
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,071
And I think

1732
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,375
I think that that would

1733
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:09,727
You disappear before he got crazy or be covered

1734
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
I think Alec

1735
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,543
Text believes that he is the wave

1736
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,336
That could wear away The Rock

1737
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
But instead in

1738
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
Noam Chomsky

1739
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,480
And to be honest I think Steve was crazy when he showed up

1740
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:23,040
I think I was just making more crazy

1741
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,320
Crazy when he was working

1742
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
Probably

1743
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,952
When he killed Aldo Moro

1744
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,768
Thinks he killed although Mara

1745
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,328
Keep did he kill Elsa

1746
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Extra

1747
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,144
So anyway

1748
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,168
We will be back

1749
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:42,752
This is been a long overdue

1750
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,544
Checking this box off

1751
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,408
And I wish to bring to a but I honestly don't I think it's just an interesting Glen

1752
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,992
Public intellectual interspec

1753
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,528
Having a conversation with Alex

1754
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,296
Text Babe

1755
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:59,904
That it steps on a number of commonalities between

1756
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,672
Where

1757
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,000
Certain critical historical

1758
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,048
Study overlaps with

1759
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
Do you know

1760
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Pseudo conspiracy

1761
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,424
Right you know and and where there is

1762
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,216
Distinction where there's a Parcher

1763
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,776
And I think you also get a really solid glimpse

1764
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:22,688
Of even in 2001 Alex is so sensitive about gone totally the only things that really

1765
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,712
Play means anything to him

1766
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:25,760
Yeah

1767
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
I mean

1768
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,296
What is

1769
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,600
Everybody danger to a certain extent

1770
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
You know

1771
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,440
Babe so many men treat guns as an extension of

1772
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
Masculinity so

1773
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,768
Maybe that's even more like at

1774
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,304
At the deepest level it's just

1775
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
Toxic Mass

1776
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,888
Masculinity property rights

1777
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,960
Could be a symbol of

1778
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,984
The idea of

1779
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,520
Personal private property

1780
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
I'm sure I don't know

1781
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,848
But it's it's it's strange

1782
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,408
It's strange that he had to make a fight out of

1783
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,432
Essentially

1784
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,504
A decent point

1785
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
Yep yep

1786
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,320
Jordan

1787
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:04,160
We are also on

1788
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,720
We are go to bed

1789
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Drawer

1790
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:13,888
World would you like to download the show please go to iTunes and if you could please

1791
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,192
Find a local charity or bail Fund in your area

1792
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
That'll help out people

1793
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,824
Until then

1794
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,104
And now here comes

1795
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,384
What the sex robot

1796
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
Thanks for holding

1797
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,808
Alexandra Thurston color

1798
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
I love you
