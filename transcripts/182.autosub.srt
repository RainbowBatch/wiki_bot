Alex

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,168
I love your work

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Dan

4
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,624
Summarizing knows what a bit that has run its courses

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
I would tell them we'll be pulling around a bunch

6
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,864
Tourette

7
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:45,568
Here we are in the world I don't know how to start this episode

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
McDonald's

9
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Just a minute ago and

10
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,736
Make me feel like I was running late getting home from

11
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
From the appointment to do this show

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
I was feeling a week from now.

13
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,464
McDonald's

14
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
And I feel worse

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Destroyed I don't know

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
I don't know how to get to Baltimore

17
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,888
Moving in the right direction

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
Kingsley moving and rolling if you got it you got it we got it

19
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
Your belly that's why I haven't even

20
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Yeah today

21
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm always for the good

22
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,856
I hope I can provide my fingers are crossed

23
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
But that will be ready in

24
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Results of it

25
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720
McDonald's

26
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Something I'm less

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,608
Concerned about being great as one of our new donors

28
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,752
Pump it up a little bit we appreciate it thank you so much

29
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Technocrat

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Tell her you're brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,088
Jar Jar Binks

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Thank you so much

33
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:14,656
Thank you very much

34
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Support the share button we haven't heard level clip in a long time and a lot of

35
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
It's been awhile we had some crap man that is hot

36
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Surgeon

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,000
Just feel exactly what was of you know

38
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Almost

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Clear evidence of

40
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
Notice

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,752
Clear notice

42
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Your stone knows a lot more than you

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Being forthright about

44
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:01,504
Especially since immediately after that we got the single greatest

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Example of a president being like

46
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
About it worry about it

47
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Willow Wood

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,472
Grammar police countdown on this morning

49
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,312
Classic

50
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
I don't know

51
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,664
Committed a bunch

52
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
The world is not responding

53
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Woodside pads

54
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
Unfortunately it's not Project Camelot

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Carrie

56
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Kerry Cassidy just recently London I believe Oregon England

57
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,080
Happy f*****-up awake and aware conference

58
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Rich

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
No one needs

60
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
To know this was just a conference at weirdos

61
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,808
Not be lying about being in the secret space program

62
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Here's the fun part

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
Project Camelot was

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Clearly a racist alien

65
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Guess what

66
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
He showed up

67
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
She confronted him about his racism on Aries like yeah but you know what you know what reality is sometimes races

68
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Perfect

69
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Perfect nothing matters nothing

70
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,039
I listen to a bit of god dammit

71
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Stillborn

72
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
So I just decided

73
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,951
I found something very interesting in the world of Jim Bakker

74
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Taking a little trip

75
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
Down to Pleasant Valley or whatever they're lucky closes

76
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
And we we start the show

77
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Something very big

78
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,711
Welcome to the Jim Bakker Show Kung Fu from the village of Morningside Ozark Mountains

79
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
Today where's the daughter

80
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Broadcast

81
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Dr. Irving

82
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Easter

83
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:24,607
I'm your compost Ricky Baker and now most of the Jim Bakker Show in my parents

84
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
Baker

85
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,663
Are you coming down or not being there

86
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,783
The Brothers Brewery

87
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
Hard to say with these Evangelical Christians could put him at 85

88
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,767
104

89
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,863
Absolutely

90
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,031
I don't want to start any kind of sibling rivalry or anything like that before

91
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,359
Charisma I would say

92
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,319
I just like how is Jim Baker's responses

93
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
Well they don't really have a relationship very

94
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,119
It would be to have to be so transactional like

95
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
Everything that they do

96
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
For Jim has to be like a

97
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
It's going to cost you one year's worth of food

98
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
The catch

99
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Very very wild stuff

100
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
Irvin Baxter I know that if you are an actual doctor you should not be

101
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Anywhere near this show

102
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
I got some thoughts about him being a doctor

103
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Are they are all

104
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
No

105
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,071
I don't know how much I want to giveaway

106
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,655
Just right off the top but I will say that Irvin Baxter has no formal education

107
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
A real doctor

108
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
From an article about him in the Dallas Observer

109
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
He's largely self-taught he finished high school but never attended college or seminary

110
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,135
Galloping and preaching his particular version of the end times

111
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
In which this massive war will kill a third of humanity

112
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,071
And Jesus Christ will return to whiskeys followers heavenward after vanquishing the Antichrist

113
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
So did he get a

114
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Did he get a PhD in

115
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Ivy's write a few books

116
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
I think he's easy like a

117
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
What's a doctor of theology like to go down to get the

118
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
Real srilanka is plans for the end times you know like being a doctor of the all

119
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
Ecology is like a you have to go to school

120
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Did you could just get it for my car

121
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,767
Diploma

122
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Let's face it

123
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,631
If you believe in this s*** you but your every meal is it

124
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
I didn't do enough that I can do a background check on this guy or anything

125
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Abuse in there

126
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,199
Guessing it's not fair to have a pattern of behavior

127
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:24,319
I'm not sure that's what it is

128
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
A very important pattern

129
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Spoilertv

130
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
But also there's other things

131
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
That are are like

132
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Guys racist

133
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
Controls about sunset

134
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,263
I'm so like I said he is a x guy

135
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Let's not let's just jump in

136
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
The two of them should hit it off famously

137
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
We are in

138
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Is that right

139
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Dr. Baxter

140
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Hayward

141
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
Maybe the end time of the end time is coming

142
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
The end time has arrived

143
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
We are in the middle of it

144
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
Let's thank God

145
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
To get to the

146
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Right we are there

147
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
You know and

148
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
You don't get

149
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
Right

150
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Little different plant but

151
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
No

152
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Open the word

153
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Even when you

154
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Bass

155
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
You teach on the Bible

156
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
You know what's

157
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
Bear bear

158
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
Sarahah

159
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Famous catch

160
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
Rejection of premise

161
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Is vacate these are both to post

162
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
Trib Rapture guys clearly from what they're saying

163
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,247
Then they would have to that admit that they should have been raptured

164
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
And are now

165
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Orders mid-trib Rapture and we haven't gotten to the halfway point believe that

166
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
There's mid trap

167
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,839
This is from that article in the Dallas Observer

168
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
This is me editorializing before I get to the quote

169
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Seems like this guy's a little nut

170
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
19 times in 30 days

171
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,015
He quit his job as an internal auditor to become an evangelist

172
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,159
He studied and prayed all day and preached at night delivering a sermon almost daily for 8 years

173
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,719
He said he was able to identify three Modern Age

174
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
Represented by biblical Beast

175
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
In the Book of Daniel

176
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
England was the lion

177
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
United States

178
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
The eagle and Russia the bear

179
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
But the 4th

180
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,031
Quote I woke up 1 Monday morning and God said go buy a newspaper

181
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,591
Mr. Baxter

182
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,735
He's Evangelical travels found him in a small town in Louisiana and a paper wasn't easy to find

183
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,087
The headline

184
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
The mystery

185
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,207
On the front page it said Germany sells leopard tanks to the Netherlands

186
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Germany was the

187
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
If you get

188
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
This from

189
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Just making it up

190
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,287
I mean just like call the Bible the Book of Daniel specifically pointing out

191
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Lions

192
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Bears

193
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Eagles

194
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
And then leopard

195
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,735
Especially especially since

196
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
I'm going to go by just

197
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
The geography

198
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Add how biology

199
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,767
In the Book of Daniel they would not have had any idea what a leopard

200
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Probably not

201
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Also

202
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,167
Interesting that Germany is not widely associated with leopards

203
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,519
It is just one headlight

204
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
Then the writer of The Book of Daniel would have had to know that one day

205
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
What's a urban Baxter would be proselytizing in a small town in Louisiana

206
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
Equator

207
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Germany and leopards

208
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Who prophesied that and put it into the canonical Bible

209
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
Possible

210
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,679
When you know you know that you know that you know

211
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Clearly

212
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
He is

213
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
And

214
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Is

215
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
Brett now Daniel

216
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
About leopards

217
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Sure

218
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Mustard

219
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,135
You know you know you know

220
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
You know you know when you know

221
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Jimmy's Egg

222
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Your prediction

223
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Antoine because

224
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Irvin Baxter fancies himself a bit of a profit

225
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
I don't think he specifically using that

226
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
To describe Irvin Baxter

227
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
That is

228
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
Now that is a in evengelical

229
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Like bulwark

230
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
Believe this b******* always comes down to if you start to confront them with

231
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
It's like reality I've had my mom and my dad both say you know

232
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,303
When you're you know when you know I understand but he's also talking about Baxter's prediction

233
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Bridging it over to his prediction

234
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Yeah I'm just saying that it's not specific

235
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
And it's not like he always

236
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
But don't talk about Baxter

237
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
So let's

238
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
From an article in the religion

239
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,599
Irvin Baxter took a deep breath and surveyed the more than 2,500 faithful

240
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
Then

241
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Some current events

242
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Voice to dire

243
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
The world's population

244
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,095
Quote two billion people will die but Mr Baxter

245
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Who's fiery oration Sunday at Garland

246
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,495
Connected Homeland Security measure the real ID Act

247
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
With Satan plant

248
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Enslave Humanity

249
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
Quote we have either just entered or we are just before the beginning of the seven-year period that will end it Armageddon

250
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
He said

251
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
This article came out

252
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
2006

253
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
We have either just entered

254
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
It is or were the middle

255
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
But it could be over

256
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
That article came out at 12

257
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Prediction

258
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
And is

259
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
Anytime you know you know

260
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
Explain that away by saying quote

261
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367
I mean if we find out the Rapture is going to happen

262
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
Days would you like us to send you a letter

263
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Good Goodwin

264
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
That's pretty smooth

265
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Of course

266
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
Because forgot only does snail

267
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
Because these guys are always con men

268
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Don't stop calling

269
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
It should be pointed out that the contact information card through that people to fill out we're also subscription cards to use magazine

270
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
Skype good

271
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
I think it's one of those like we get you up for free and then you got a recurring sale

272
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
It's weird that it's a $30 a month

273
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Subscription for

274
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
4 Page magazine

275
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
So he's just

276
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
Traveling itinerant

277
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Preacher I don't think anymore

278
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,431
But back in these days he's just randomly going around

279
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
Who gets out of town before you realized

280
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
What's happened

281
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
You still in monorail

282
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
Little bit further in the past

283
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
And talk about what he

284
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
I'd say about the Iraq War

285
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Alright

286
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
Article in the Washington Post

287
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:08,703
Call Sarah lifelong student of Old and New Testament prophecies said casualties will be tremendous

288
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,311
Not only of combatants in Iraq put people in neighboring countries hit by retaliatory missiles of mass

289
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Destruction

290
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
An American to fall victim to terrorist

291
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Disarm the portable nuclear weapon

292
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,479
In other and other countries will take the opportunity

293
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Pursue their own interest

294
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
China trying to retake Taiwan or India

295
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
An all-out assault on Kashmir

296
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
Leading to World War 3

297
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
He said the results back to Baxter

298
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,839
Conclude could be nuclear Holocaust that takes the lies of two billion people the 1/3 of mankind

299
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Revelation

300
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
Constantly trying to work that 1/3

301
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Also

302
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
That is not technically a third

303
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Scores from 2003 so far

304
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
I also in his March April

305
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,439
2013 and Time Magazine Baxter reported the quote Iran's nuclear program is complete

306
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
Citing a quote Source in the revolution

307
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Guards

308
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Intelligence unit

309
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,655
I don't think or talk to him

310
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Hold on

311
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
How did you get ahold of this song

312
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
I need to know that

313
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,383
I need I need information about that clay

314
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
I unfortunately

315
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
I was traveling around

316
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Preaching the Lord's word

317
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,695
As the Bible tells me to do in Perrine one more

318
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
And God said to me

319
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
Fly to tehran's see what happens

320
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
So I did and I bought a newspaper

321
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
First off

322
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Lotta Love

323
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
I met a member of the royal Revolution

324
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
I explained

325
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
And he was like dude

326
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,711
You have no idea how great the end times is going to be

327
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
We're going to start

328
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,783
Perfect

329
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
Two possible option

330
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Most likely

331
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Exciting without sliding

332
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
Some sort of Republican

333
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
And they're making it up and he

334
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Poorly reporting app

335
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Predictions

336
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
Regan picknsave that was just a cursory glance

337
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
We can see that

338
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
You're like it's always

339
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
A third of humanity

340
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
But it's the context in

341
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
Change

342
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
About almost everything

343
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Do the same material

344
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,951
3 years if you're going to be an itinerant preacher

345
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
So

346
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,911
You might be thinking that he's calling this is going to be the end of the world

347
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,519
Be wrong

348
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Reveal

349
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,455
Kind of tip their hand here a little bit

350
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,551
Got that on the other end of this clip because I make it clear what they're interested in

351
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
Watchmore

352
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
What is enchantment

353
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Well

354
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
I have people

355
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,095
What are you do I see why I'm the founder president I'm Ministries

356
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
The backup freeze

357
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
And I said no stop

358
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895
Call Dad

359
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
And the beginning of

360
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
The kingdom of God

361
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
The present government

362
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Are coming down

363
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
The Bible says in Daniel

364
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
79 I beheld of a Thrones work

365
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
And the extra days that's it

366
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
4 long

367
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,839
Good politics is bad politics and Squirtle get rid of them all and Jesus

368
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,703
Surprised

369
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,799
Blerg

370
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
But like the it is it is important to

371
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,599
To point this out because like the 1000 year reign of Christ on Earth

372
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,463
They're fine with starting that without Christ showing up

373
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Isn't he going all of us though

374
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,143
So if you want a thousand year reign of Christ you have to have the people

375
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,007
With whom Christ is inside kill the rest

376
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,847
And that's how the end

377
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
No no no I got would never allow that they have a little bit of a crusade actually go a little bit more

378
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Murdertown guy in the in the Book of Revelations

379
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
And the old test

380
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
And everywhere that's not Jesus saying please don't murder me

381
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
Jesus

382
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
I never really thought about it too much

383
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:03,615
What the end times as a like

384
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,711
Considered until I heard him phrase it that way

385
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,831
Maybe that's the part that I don't consider

386
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
By default

387
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Religious

388
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Messaging

389
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,816
Call obvious

390
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Iskcon people Express

391
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
These sorts of ideas

392
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
Like I said I think

393
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
I can't put it better than to say

394
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
They're fine starting without God

395
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,640
Define starting without actual Jesus appearing they don't need that part

396
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
Bill McDonald make filmmaker

397
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
She would ruin it

398
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
I think

399
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
Thank you to have trouble selling those buckets

400
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
I don't think Jesus would be thrilled at the buckets

401
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,048
I think you'd be really offended by The Carter 4

402
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
Disorder

403
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
Ministry

404
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Yeah

405
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:07,616
So you know what I'm sorry for sorry

406
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,456
The one the one thing that I really hear now that I I

407
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
I haven't for awhile is like

408
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,392
The cuz most people when they're doing the end times Ministry don't do the the second part the Thousand-Year reign

409
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Christ

410
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,256
And I think that's mainly because now we know how long time is

411
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
And that's not that long

412
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
You don't get a while like back then no it is a while but back then 1,000 years is all of the time that there

413
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
Aware of sure sure

414
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,736
3 billion years old 7 years is not that long even if you want to go with us though the Earth being only six

415
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Thousand years old

416
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:51,392
A thousand years is still not that long what can happen after the Thousand Years

417
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
I don't know

418
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,072
Yeah. It only fine with us 6th of the length of time that the

419
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,400
You're putting your finger on that something

420
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,960
It's interesting is the human aspect of these

421
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Supposedly divinely

422
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,104
Inspired ideas

423
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
History

424
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Help

425
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
But

426
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Impressive

427
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
We don't worry about those things

428
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
We spell

429
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Battleship

430
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
It's so

431
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
Jesus

432
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,024
Read another commercial for those water bottles

433
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
Do not

434
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:37,472
Drink the water no

435
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Is the life

436
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
The sales going on

437
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,832
Give me the second part of this commercial it's really fascinating that their sales pitch

438
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Is basically

439
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,904
You find yourself going to be helpful

440
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
It's great

441
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
Find anywhere else

442
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,144
Breaks down at the airport for a couple bucks

443
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:12,544
Do you need this $80 bottle of water bottle with a filter

444
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
In high altitude

445
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,664
What's the problem at all cuz you know he used it on Riverwalk

446
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,040
Mister Fantastic

447
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Scooped up

448
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
We're having

449
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,280
Three of these for just my birthday

450
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Free shipping

451
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
I mean

452
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
You're still a 205 dollar value

453
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,008
For $78

454
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
And that's my

455
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
My birthday special

456
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
But I don't get any of that

457
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
That is

458
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
All goes

459
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Keep this ministry on the air

460
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
But this

461
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
Is the king of all bombs

462
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
You can take water out of a mud puddle

463
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
And filter

464
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
And drink it

465
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
You drink water out of the Mist

466
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Zippy when it

467
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Villanova

468
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
You did out of this bottle

469
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
He's obsessed with this river water

470
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Loved

471
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
Special but don't worry

472
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Go fuc yourself

473
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848

$5

477
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
The Cure

478
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
F******

479
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Gulliver

480
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,904
Almost makes me want to buy one

481
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Just like

482
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
The blatancy of that scam

483
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
Is so

484
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
It's hard to imagine me not being like

485
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Listen

486
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
You got me on this

487
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
I love it

488
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
I love it

489
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,776
Good call I love obscenely overpriced dumbshit

490
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
You can't beat that kind of savings

491
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
205 bucks 47

492
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
What you going to do I don't know

493
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
So what are the things you should know is

494
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Much like all of these

495
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
Sort of area into the end times

496
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
Doomsday

497
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
Pro-israel

498
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
He's really into Israel

499
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
And of course

500
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Is very celebratory of trump

501
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Change

502
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Empathy

503
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,264
It's all they talk about it here and then I just have a weird thought

504
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
Father Kurt to me while I was looking

505
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Episode

506
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
We will discuss on the other end of this

507
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
On December 6th

508
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
I'm sure you know what I'm referring

509
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
Donald Trump decided

510
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
He was going to recognize Jerusalem

511
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
As the Capo

512
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
Business

513
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
Is going to be there

514
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
Oh so quiet

515
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
Doesn't run around the world

516
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
He's going to Israel

517
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,544
Literally be there on the 70th anniversary

518
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,384
And be there when they open up the embassy

519
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
Is that it

520
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Just a thought that I have two thoughts

521
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
Jim Bakker sister haven't stopped talking to

522
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,120
Crazy I have no idea

523
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Transact

524
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
Everything is transactional

525
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,264
To me like when you have somebody who has had such

526
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
The career of like

527
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Manipulation and lies based crime

528
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Bed like a stealer like

529
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,968
I'm going to go I'm going to go to the hangout at Morningview

530
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,624
I'm going to still associate with him at some point say that such a don't exist in a

531
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:44,768
Meijer on one level

532
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
Is it a promise of a lot of buckets of food when the end could be the knowledge

533
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,568
She was there when snipers were shooting

534
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
Down there for a nice maybe cracking the champagne bottle

535
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
She was actually there when

536
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Murders

537
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Where I continue

538
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
Looking for a pallet

539
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
It's a nurse

540
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,656
That was the best I could do

541
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,496
The exact nature of the israeli-palestinian conflict

542
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
It's something that people smarter than us

543
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:34,688
Can do a much better job better job than Irvin Baxter

544
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
At the dedication of the first temple

545
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
God said I will put my name

546
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
In Jerusalem

547
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,720
Alaska reasons been more Warriors than any other city on earth

548
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Because

549
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,584
You want your name there

550
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
Guess where I want my

551
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,448
And the final war Armageddon

552
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,104
The biggest shoe that I have there is I don't

553
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Like the idea

554
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Like

555
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Petulant

556
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Siblings

557
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,880
Is God and the devil like I really don't I don't I'm not a fan of that

558
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,976
You have a ball in your brother wants it

559
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
I don't

560
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,328
Creator of universe

561
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,912
I'm not into it I find it also to be

562
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
A profound

563
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Failing

564
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
Our intellectual

565
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872

619
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304

620
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Eating you

621
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664

624
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
To pay the bill

625
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,840
My guess knows where Jesus is coming back and he's taking it out for

626
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:41,216
Festival seating blanket down maybe have a brunch

627
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
Little little little picnic

628
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Absolutely

629
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Then

630
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,856
Pivot on your own

631
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,512
And hate guys in order for us to continue scaring about the end of the world

632
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:08,864
Continue this feedback cycle weed eater

633
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,216
How many very similar to Alex Jones

634
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Experian

635
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Thousands of years of the end times are happening

636
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Now

637
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
Christians going to accept

638
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,688
Before they're like

639
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
Maybe the end times

640
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
It seems infinite

641
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
It does kind of seem infinite right

642
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
The years that I've been an adult

643
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
The weather of

644
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,464
Funeral like II we've gone through this

645
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
Over and over

646
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
The end times going to happen

647
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,496
Right right thousands of years has said we are living through the end

648
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
But some of that might just have to

649
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
To do is like a

650
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
A lot of these

651
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
These Prophets

652
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
And speculators

653
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Con man

654
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
Being unwilling or unable to

655
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
To wrestle with metaphor

656
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
Historical context

657
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
We're written

658
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
Lego bring together books that were written

659
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Hundreds of years apart

660
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,768
History of

661
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,096
The socio-political climate was different

662
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
This is what you know there's

663
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
Lumos

664
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
Well one day

665
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
God told him to turn his

666
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
TV on

667
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
To National

668
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
Right and he saw a

669
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
And as we all know

670
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
Hawks are represent

671
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
Chirp

672
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
That Hawk

673
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Coming

674
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
Ferrari

675
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,488
That's what's going on

676
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,632
We are either in the beginning or

677
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:51,264
Do you know if you know you know

678
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,104
That last clip was a pretty harsh

679
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Add pivots

680
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
But nothing could have

681
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Like prepared me for

682
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Jim Bakker

683
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,552
Accidentally saying something that I think is profound

684
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
On-air about his money

685
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Stop

686
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,440
Just shortly after

687
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
I have to pay the bill

688
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Fiorinal

689
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
TV station

690
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
Don't they just give you that time

691
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,312
Some cost me $17,000 for 1 hour

692
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
TV for about 50

693
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,040
Seitan everyday

694
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,696
America

695
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488

699
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432

You're peeing to be on of course anybody can be on AirPlay pay for it

00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:11,136
Like I'm on all these

702
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
But also

703
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
I don't think Alex Jones is nearly

704
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Guilty

705
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Time slots are probably broke

706
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
Programming on radio station

707
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,936
Windsor

708
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:29,824
You know like that's all that really likes

709
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Again

710
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
The right-wing

711
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
Talk radio

712
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
This is what like freedomworks

713
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,016
Americans for Prosperity and the Heritage Foundation

714
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
Booster careers

715
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,368
I'd like a Rush Limbaugh

716
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
And that Glenn Beck in particular Mark Levin

717
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
All these people they would do

718
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Embedded commercials

719
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
Open stuff like that for the Heritage Foundation

720
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,864
It always talk about how positive there

721
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,168
Their information that was coming out was

722
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,472
And it was because they were buying all there at

723
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,800
They were both stirring them they were buying their books in bulk

724
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
To make it look like they were bestsellers

725
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
This is

726
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,688
The scams that goes on

727
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
This is the next

728
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
Level of the media scam

729
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Keyscan behind

730
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
The scam

731
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
Like Jim Bakker is on are scamming Granny's

732
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
You tell them water bottles

733
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
Is it like that they'll never know

734
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
They're selling unless they go to the

735
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
River selling these food

736
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Gates and stuff like that

737
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Super level scam

738
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
I meant the business

739
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Behind it

740
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
I wish I think Jim Bakker

741
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
He probably does have to

742
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
You know Pony up and buy every

743
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Still he's making money off

744
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
You can't afford $17,000 for an hour unless you are make

745
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
Lot of money

746
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,976
I have to pay for all this and I break you

747
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,512
Nope not a f****** turn outage

748
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
I'm beat. The other side of it is

749
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
The people like the rush

750
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
Who

751
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
You know whatever their career is now.

752
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
15 years ago

753
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,568
They were only in the position they were in because of those

754
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
Benefactor

755
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Just like that

756
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,736
There's not very there isn't that on the left

757
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,856
We don't have that evil about it

758
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,184
No but everyone wants to pretend that that's what Soros is doing

759
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,536
Eva wants to pretend that that's what's happening but it's not I know you are but what am I

760
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
I8

761
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
It will never it will never end

762
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
The

763
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,216
The Brilliance of the the right wing

764
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
To do the most

765
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Evil ship

766
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
And then simultaneous

767
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
Easley accuse their enemies of doing eggs

768
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
Exactly what they're due

769
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
As a way to preempt you

770
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,016
From criticizing them for doing what they're doing

771
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
See Rodger

772
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
Stone in August

773
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
It's

774
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Really

775
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
It is awful and that

776
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,488
That's why we lose that's why we lose

777
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Like

778
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Strongco Highway

779
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
I'm not even positive how you do it

780
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Necessarily

781
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Really

782
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
It's works

783
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
They might be

784
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Socialism

785
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
Maybe I don't know

786
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,712
The do certain things are certainly beyond our capabilities as broadcasters we don't f****** know

787
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
What the answer is we just no problem

788
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,064
There it is look at it

789
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:24,416
That's the other name of this show. Look at look at them

790
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,256
They're all con men and looking

791
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Look at it

792
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
Stare into the abyss

793
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,376
There were similarities

794
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
Make this episode of

795
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Very relevant

796
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Do the Alex Jones

797
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
That we know

798
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,896
And the topics that we cover for play structure that to Jim Bakker

799
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Expressing I don't think that

800
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Maybe not

801
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
The biggest

802
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,064
Parallel I think there's some overlap and nothing I can prove

803
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
He's probably dishes

804
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
For some of those Channel

805
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
War room

806
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
But be that as it may

807
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
To me is

808
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Like

809
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,752
As a businessman Alex

810
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
That's not a terrible idea

811
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
We don't know that

812
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
We don't know that

813
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,272
I know that you will soon

814
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Like this is like

815
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
You might as well have Alex Jones

816
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
On the Jim Bakker

817
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
The Jerusalem Embassy

818
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
Pastor 1995 IR Congress

819
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
Which is a half

820
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Move the embassy

821
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Buttery

822
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
They put an algae

823
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,776
Security the president can sign a waiver

824
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,104
So guess what 44 time

825
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,688
The presence of sign waivers online

826
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,528
And then

827
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
Afraid of the enemies of their afraid of offending

828
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
The un's destined to be

829
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
A Wonderful World

830
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,560
Actually we're going to go straight directly against

831
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
Do you win

832
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
V

833
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,216
Because that's serious

834
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
The One World Government

835
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
I'll just

836
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
Is outside

837
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
Charter

838
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,944
That just I mean that's just not yelling Alex

839
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
And that's why we need

840
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Strong

841
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Nationalist movement

842
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,112
That aligns itself with other name

843
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
In order to make sure everybody's nationalist

844
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,256
In a global unified front

845
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
Yeah that makes sense

846
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
Could it also be

847
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Now I'm going to positive

848
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,728
Could also be that the reason

849
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
That the waivers have been signed 44 times

850
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
They were aware of the

851
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Mass murder

852
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,223
And

853
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
Instability of the region that we

854
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
With results

855
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
From

856
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
That's an interesting Theory

857
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
I'm just saying

858
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,719
Possible possible

859
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:12,863
I'm just saying that it might be that our government has known is real would be willing to murder any and everybody

860
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,495
I want to focus more on Irvin Baxter

861
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,335
He believes in a satanic One World Government

862
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,175
Even further parallels of Alex here in a little bit revelation

863
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,967
I want to talk about something very specific

864
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
This guy

865
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
It's been making money

866
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
That's kind of what he does

867
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
That's one of the ways you Stokes up here

868
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
So what do you think

869
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
Married to you here what do you think about that

870
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,583
The signing of an arab-israeli peace treaty will be the most important prophetic fulfillment

871
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
The crucifixion

872
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Jesus

873
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,679
According to the Bible the signing of this treaty will begin

874
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,495
The last 7 years before the final battle of Armageddon

875
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,567
In the middle of the seven-year. The Great Tribulation begin

876
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
That's something he wrote

877
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Okay

878
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Now

879
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
Little lessons

880
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,527
Sincere when you realize that he wrote that

881
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
In 1990

882
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,087
D2

883
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:15,071
Still got time to be right then

884
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,631
He's not he's talking about the tallest Noah Court

885
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,471
7 years is a lot longer in God

886
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,103
The date of God is a thousand years exactly

887
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
The tree will be signed in 1993 is it coincidental that 1993 is 7 years from the year 2000

888
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,783
Yes

889
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,671
As always

890
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Is it part of a con

891
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,255
The article that you wrote goes on to say

892
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,631
We want to send out 1 million magazines in America this month as the treaty is signed

893
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
People will not respond

894
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,263
Is that what they do not know this special emergency edition of end time

895
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,079
We'll explain the arab-israeli treaty and its role in Prophecy

896
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,639
The cost of printing and mailing a million magazines

897
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Is $400,000

898
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
We're opening a emergency fund savings

899
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,575
All who would like to help awaken America May contribute to this emergency fund

900
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,903
After four issues event time we will have 10,000 subscription

901
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,255
If 10000 people give $40 a piece we could all wake in America

902
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
I'm sure all of the

903
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
The money in that for

904
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
Awakening America

905
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
Looking to go to that

906
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
Secure

907
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
I guarantee that all of the money that

908
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Yeah

909
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Just going to go right back out to the

910
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
It's very easy to see through game

911
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Like I said

912
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
Much more similar

913
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Alex

914
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
It starts in this next clip and it made me

915
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Stutter

916
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,463
We often refer to International Community

917
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,999
New World Order

918
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:53,887
World community

919
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
Hurting this whole world

920
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Then you can control

921
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
Every person on Earth

922
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,223
And he intends to control every person on Earth

923
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
You know what he wants to do

924
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
He wants you

925
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
To worship

926
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Him

927
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,439
Instead of you and me worshipping God

928
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
He wants us to worship

929
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
And he's got a plan to her the whole human race

930
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
It's true this one world government

931
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,167
They call it globalism

932
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Oh boy

933
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,615
How fun is that

934
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
You know I have

935
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,943
Okay

936
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
So

937
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
Satan wants everybody to worship

938
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
At bright

939
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,319
He wants the balls at

940
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,695
Has it has any ever put forth a good reason why that bad

941
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,023
You mean as God or Jesus before the reason

942
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,351
Yeah or or even Irvin Baxter

943
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,167
If Satan wants everybody in the planet to worship Him

944
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,215
Because he's old scratch

945
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:07,615
He's a liar but I feel like if everybody agreed

946
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
Solo piano

947
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:14,271
So how is it different if the One World Government Old Scratch

948
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,671
It's still two supernatural beings with

949
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,463
Infinite power

950
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,791
Can do whatever it is they want and we're just

951
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Why would you want to be part of that.

952
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,887
I think if you want it

953
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,727
Look at it from a humanistic standpoint and take the lot of the

954
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
Window-dressing away

955
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,639
I think the argument that they would make would have something to do with like God has your best interest in heart

956
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,711
Read the Bible

957
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,527
He does I think he kind of doesn't like

958
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
It's case-by-case

959
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,927
The argument that they would make his Vic God respect

960
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Man and

961
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
Old Scratch

962
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Just wants to trick

963
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
I mean but if he gets what he wants

964
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
Why would he continue to trick

965
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Because

966
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:10,079
Jim Bakker went to prison for fraud

967
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Wait what

968
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,503
What that argument is four or the equivalent of the

969
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
The devil getting his way

970
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
In some ways because it's the logical fruition of the

971
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Xcamy was pulling

972
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,927
Okay

973
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:30,815
Keep doing it after he'd already played it outright I would argue him going to prison is not a failure necessarily

974
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,375
Okay

975
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
A money to meet the day he got out of prison

976
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,543
True no arguments for yourself

977
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
Hey Auntie idea that he can't keep

978
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
Keep doing it again

979
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
Like you can't just like that

980
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,967
I was wrong

981
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
Wicked

982
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,295
Stupid pet to me is the devil getting his way

983
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:56,415
I'm probably wrong about the really not following

984
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,535
Really don't know what to draw

985
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
It would be

986
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,703
I don't know why does Alex keep lying now.

987
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
Trump's president

988
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
More games

989
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Metro

990
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,359
So maybe it's that maybe the devil gets in charge of everything and 90s

991
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,271
And then he would protect Jesus was trying to

992
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,343
Destroy things from behind the scenes

993
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
You know it would be something like that

994
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Did the games

995
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,303
We played with lies Never End never end

996
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,375
No that's depressing

997
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
Real f*****-up

998
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
If you're like

999
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:46,079
Globalism and globalist

1000
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
People who are

1001
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,199
In alignment with him without

1002
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,503
Pulling the whole enzymes

1003
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
Right

1004
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,599
So some of that but not nearly as overt as this

1005
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
But yeah

1006
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
Definitely listen

1007
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
Infowars but I wouldn't

1008
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Surprise

1009
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,791
Or at least is like in that community

1010
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
Like that that weird

1011
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,703
If you ran into white make

1012
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Perfect sense

1013
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,151
Infowars a Json so the people that you know

1014
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:27,551
No info ideas made Popular by something Irvin Baxter

1015
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Yearly is in

1016
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
And that's not good

1017
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,951
Text Cliff also because a lot of these ideas are based on

1018
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Protocols of the Elders of Zion

1019
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,839
Course

1020
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
We get to hear another similarity

1021
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
With Alex Jones

1022
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
Am I

1023
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
017 Republican

1024
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,407
All the sudden he starts speaking against

1025
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Wait a minute

1026
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Good

1027
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
Speak against globalism

1028
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,623
And then he spoke again

1029
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
The establishment

1030
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
I need it for 50 years

1031
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,999
The same power control both

1032
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,095
Republican and Democratic Party

1033
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:16,703
There's a private club in America + 50

1034
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,263
What are the Republicans on power or the Democrats

1035
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
I wonder why

1036
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
Isis does.

1037
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Under

1038
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,159
A politician

1039
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:42,559
I can't imagine what would happen

1040
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:50,239
Somebody who's willing to update or perhaps the corrupt

1041
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:58,687
I think every three weeks we have a politician running on upending the establishment

1042
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
I think this is a good story

1043
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
For a person

1044
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,271
The towels because

1045
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,111
Bury the lede of like I heard him saying really f***** up stuff and I was like

1046
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,439
He's going to be repressive

1047
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,487
2

1048
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
I heard

1049
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Donald's

1050
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Olmec

1051
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
I've never heard of her

1052
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,191
Say that before

1053
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,031
You don't want to be the guy going on Jim Bakker Show

1054
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:29,151
He was against the establishment

1055
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
That you can grab them by the p**** I was

1056
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
Absolutely

1057
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,855
I read about him raping his wife

1058
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
So

1059
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Like

1060
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,999
I don't know

1061
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
You know you have

1062
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,303
You have this guest

1063
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Jim Bakker

1064
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
Gershow super into

1065
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,191
Real inaccurate end time prophecies

1066
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
And it turns out he also believes the same

1067
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Alex Jones about

1068
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,311
Superfund

1069
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Hey

1070
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
Also this is super fun

1071
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
I don't think

1072
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,991
I think that he was a good example of Evan Baxter talkingshit

1073
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,039
The Bible actually tells us

1074
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
September's a great harvest coming

1075
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,415
Because we've got these two witnesses you know

1076
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,975
Satan has his two ages

1077
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,511
Antichrist and false prophet

1078
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
They're alive somewhere today

1079
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,959
Do you know who I am Christ

1080
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,823
But these two are on the York right now

1081
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,151
Because

1082
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
He will send his

1083
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
Two witnesses

1084
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
They called them

1085
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
The two witnesses are the two Prophets

1086
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,855
Alexana prophesy for 1260 days

1087
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
And these two

1088
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Bistro

1089
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Preacher

1090
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Powerful

1091
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,535
They're going to be at the option to turn off

1092
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,911
Sometimes the water will be turned in

1093
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,079
Are pass-through turn off water

1094
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,151
You know what

1095
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,455
What you going to do that's what happened to Flint Michigan

1096
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,551
God for a little bit too long Waters oil now

1097
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,623
So we got the false prophet and

1098
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,439
Impersonate Christ

1099
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,279
Right arm in the Falls prophet bolsters

1100
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:26,655
Turn off rain

1101
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,567
I don't know I don't like this like superhero match I don't like it this is the worst Avengers movie

1102
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,919
Good side

1103
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
What is the other guy do

1104
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:45,855
The other guys

1105
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,207
How deep is Run DMC

1106
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,791
All right we got this is this is over

1107
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,887
This is a run the jewels you got your Killer Mike you got your lp1

1108
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
Not the best rapper

1109
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
The other guys

1110
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
Spits Hot Fire

1111
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,751
Subway ghost

1112
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:08,895
Now we now you're going to disagree with me about LP.

1113
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,343
Well that's what a lot of people

1114
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,487
Like in these circles believe

1115
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
Antichrist

1116
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,607
Evil

1117
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
B Pope

1118
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
He's telling us

1119
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,775
Should survive and we shouldn't destroy

1120
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,823
He is saying that it's okay

1121
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,383
Be a human being and accept other people

1122
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,175
And there's only one

1123
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,223
Call Abbott

1124
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:48,575
Salt as opposed to the other Pope who was a Nazi

1125
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,623
What that was a great talk

1126
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,559
The pope who covered up sexual abuse that wasn't the false prophet that was a great Pope

1127
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,119
The thing that I love about this

1128
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,423
Is that so

1129
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
It's so Evan backs

1130
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,751
Hairstyle to be like

1131
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,103
He's very careful not to make these specific predict

1132
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Send about Doomsday's

1133
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,175
Which is able to very easily

1134
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,479
Come up with a couple

1135
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:23,391
Years B you would never be dumb enough to be like I know who the Antichrist messenger is

1136
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,927
Is the false prophet

1137
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
Honest

1138
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
Listen to

1139
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,047
You don't get any cash out of that it's not fun

1140
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,607
Set sexy when you're wrong all the time

1141
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,655
I love

1142
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,447
This level of psycho

1143
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
Like serial killers

1144
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,567
Is there such a bummer

1145
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:47,455
They're fascinating but they're bomber like this level of psychopathy

1146
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:54,367
And sleep so well probably another day in the factory School

1147
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,671
People out of money I am good

1148
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
He probably has left

1149
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
Concern of like

1150
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
People hurting him

1151
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,303
And more like the IRS

1152
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,679
Beer is kind of like know when I'm in trouble

1153
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,895
They always think they're going to outsmart whoever's coming after that

1154
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
So

1155
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,223
The only

1156
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,271
I had that reinforced

1157
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
Out of prison

1158
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,599
And jumping back into this game is like

1159
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:32,255
All they did to me was put me away for a few years but now I just hang out in a cell with Lyndon larouche

1160
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:42,239
I can do this again the parameters of what's not acceptable I know my limits now

1161
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,055
All over again I came in with a

1162
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
Marijuana and I came out with a bachelor's in

1163
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,919
Cocaine or whatever

1164
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
All this is

1165
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
Is to say that this is just

1166
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,087
Banging the same gone over and over

1167
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Goddamn car

1168
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
Just trying to

1169
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
This game granny

1170
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
Out of money

1171
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,535
Poor people who've been caught up in the fear cycle

1172
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,327
More importantly

1173
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,607
Do what there is

1174
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,167
Espousing has real-world consequences

1175
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,959
And it's awesome

1176
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
Easy to

1177
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,079
To say they don't really care about the consequences just want the money

1178
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,615
But sometimes

1179
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
They accidentally

1180
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Depakote

1181
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,087
Kind of want to hurt the people that they end up here

1182
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,135
So they're like a they're like

1183
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
First

1184
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
Bright close second

1185
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,327
Remind me

1186
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,607
I don't even know but

1187
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
Ariel

1188
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
And then

1189
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
With the next

1190
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Video

1191
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Is the first

1192
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,007
Armageddon

1193
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
We probably vote

1194
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Started

1195
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
And I'll just

1196
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,919
Hit the Hat just a little bit

1197
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
And that is

1198
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,551
And I believe it was November 29th of 2012

1199
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:04,927
The general assembly of the UN

1200
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
As

1201
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,999
A non-member state

1202
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
Recognized

1203
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Join

1204
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,447
The world Court

1205
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,983
I must have become

1206
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,287
The international criminal court

1207
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,103
They have the right to file charges against Israel

1208
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
Put the leaders of Israel on

1209
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,063
So this was the first step

1210
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
Please protect your DVD

1211
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,487
That's another aspect of the understand

1212
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,559
Are you need to know because

1213
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
The king is coming back

1214
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,167
You know all hell's going to break loose

1215
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
So

1216
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,031
He is super afraid of the idea of Palestinians haven't right

1217
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:58,431
That's a terrible the right of

1218
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
Recourse

1219
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
You start giving people rides

1220
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
We've seen this

1221
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
Time and time again throughout his

1222
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
You start giving people rice

1223
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
Eminem

1224
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
That is true

1225
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
That is true

1226
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,791
The only the only the end time for one thing

1227
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,119
But I don't need

1228
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
It's not even

1229
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:25,823
I think we're probably talking about like white supremacy

1230
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
It's more than that it's

1231
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,431
Cuz it's not just about what

1232
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:36,319
Minority-majority

1233
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:42,463
System of Oppression South Africa

1234
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,327
People and then being really pissed when 90% of the population

1235
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,399
They aren't we human beings

1236
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
No

1237
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:58,335
No interest in the status quo being equitable

1238
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,359
Wrong can have

1239
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,151
Recourse other than

1240
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,967
Protesting in getting shot outside a wall

1241
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
So

1242
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,295
Cool we let them have their protest

1243
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087

01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,159
Do whatever they want

1245
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Do what thou wilt

1246
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,791
Take me to rule the world

Play One More clip

1250
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:32,895

I'm have that guy stand Deo on

1252

Jim Bakker

1259
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,583

Could very well happen

1274
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
In your life

Destiny

1296
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,015
Most people think

1297
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
America doesn't have much

1298
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,207
Really I haven't seen this one yet

Be like Israel

1300
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,559
Comedy is at the end

1301
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327

You knew it's b******* because if I understand the volcano under Yellowstone correctly

1309
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,559
That is an extinction-level event

1310
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,095
If it if it erupts

1311
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,655
It's going to kill the planet

1312
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447

Estimates say that I don't know

1316
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,151
The definite thing or sort of a

1317
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
Worse than

01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455

I think I think regardless it's like a climate change in your phone

1321
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
You know

1322
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:30,303
Like and all the stuff that he's talking about climate change is already doing as we speak like people are

1323
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
Absolutely

1324
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,911
Displacement

1325
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:41,311
Leading to increased nationalism which ones have leading to Wars

1326
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
Caesars

1327
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,407
And respect the outcomes when it's presented

1328
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,711
You as a science fiction movie premise

1329
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,807
Like Yellowstone blowing up

1330
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:56,927
Spirit really happening in the world around you

1331
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
Whatever

1332
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,607
Sing the thing that I

1333
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Notice

1334
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,447
Most as far as a parallel

1335
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
Baker and

1336
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,383
When you go down to the lowest levels

1337
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
The blue stuff

1338
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
It's.

1339
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
And what bums

1340
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
Doubt about that

1341
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,783
Christian

1342
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Are like

1343
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,111
Well we would never be taken in by that

1344
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,159
You mean like out

1345
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:33,791
We would never adjust Dominican Republic we would never be taken in by

1346
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,679
You just go up 11 with the same f****** scam and they're just better at it

1347
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:45,823
Go down all the way to the bottom and then you can extrapolate do this whole thing is a f******

1348
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,663
These guys that were looking at all the time or the desperate con

1349
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,943
Exist

1350
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Either tricks

1351
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,807
Very easily

1352
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
On higher level

1353
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
Absolutely

1354
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,415
That's the contention that I hold very strongly

1355
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,631
To me what's fascinating is that there

1356
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,215
Think I would be

1357
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Wave

1358
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,591
Better off with myself if I was taken in by like a really good,

1359
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,871
You know like the best

1360
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Con man

1361
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,175
There's no shame in that

1362
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,735
You know you got taken in by the best

1363
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:31,135
Going to get you still good

1364
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:37,535
Would be better if I could call it would be better that it be a good one

1365
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,543
You got me

1366
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,943
When you're taken and Christians are are pissed off about what and that's why they can't get back

1367
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,015
Is because they keep they get to look down on people

1368
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
Taken in by the

1369
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,135
Cuz it makes them feel better about being taken in by a better comment

1370
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,487
At least I got a better one

1371
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,839
Stupid for the comfort of the con

1372
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,375
To hear the bark

1373
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,983
The conman isn't just offering you a way to get rid of money they're offering you a presentation

1374
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:19,775
So for like

1375
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,799
Jim Bakker

1376
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Minions

1377
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,639
Maybe not his supporters

1378
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,175
People who

1379
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,503
His minions are his children they get fake food out of it

1380
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,343
Time to get the comfort of checking that off the list

1381
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,183
Right in reality there's probably no need for those buckets ever if they're gross

1382
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,231
And you don't want them

1383
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,559
The fact that you have them in your home get rid of some sort of in

1384
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,095
Insecurities that

1385
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:44,863
Created in

1386
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,167
MSN way that Alex Jones

1387
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,215
Because the world is so scary

1388
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
And so can

1389
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:50,751
Fusing

1390
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
He is able to

1391
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,311
Contextualize the world

1392
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Adolescent

1393
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:57,663
The people are really like it gives you a comfort if you

1394
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,759
You think that all the world is this one group of people who are messy

1395
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Things up

1396
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:08,159
Trying to get us all to fight with each other or whatever because I want a One World Government

1397
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Strapped whole thing

1398
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:15,071
That's much easier than being like now man there's Rogue agents all over the place people are selfish

1399
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,887
People often miscommunicate thing sometimes

1400
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,167
Things happen by accident

1401
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,959
You know that there is

1402
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,751
That's hard to deal with because

1403
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
Chaos of it

1404
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,055
Leaves you with

1405
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,079
Anon

1406
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:33,247
Really verbal anxiety because I never going to be able to know all of it so if you

1407
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
Berryville

1408
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:38,111
Blah blah blah

1409
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Your house offers

1410
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,183
And that's that's the part of me that I think

1411
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,999
Open up part of me that's a part of this that I find the most

1412
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Gross

1413
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Is it

1414
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:51,935
Anxieties in order to relieve them

1415
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,519
The hegelian dialect if you will problem reaction

1416
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:59,871
Solution on are on a psychological level they are offering that to their listeners

1417
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,919
And the solution is always money

1418
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,991
Always the queen to get might give us money

1419
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,063
It will either give you a thing or we'll fight the globalist for you

1420
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,647
And that will solve your problems and you can go out your life

1421
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,207
Bright

1422
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
You are taking

1423
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:20,607
Arrows but still be afraid of not white.

1424
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
Because they're usually up something Soros is paying

1425
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
To be mad at you

1426
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,239
Bruno's I am

1427
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
The

1428
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
Fears that they have of the mm

1429
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
Like the

1430
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
The devil

1431
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,455
Like all of those things

1432
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
Light

1433
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,527
It is interesting to me

1434
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,295
Cuz

1435
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
The real

1436
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,135
Reality is so much of this s*** is

1437
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,159
Actually just psycho

1438
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,791
Does not have the ability to feel emotions

1439
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,815
For other human being

1440
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
He is a

1441
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,607
True psycho

1442
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,631
Hey what's up

1443
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:59,007
His daughter

1444
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,847
Like so many of you know they do that they do the surveys and all that

1445
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,895
Like what is the highest

1446
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,687
Is possibility of finding a psychopath

1447
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
Go to work

1448
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,527
What is the highest place where you can find psychopath

1449
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,551
Go to d.c.

1450
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,855
Like all of these places of power we're stuck

1451
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
Psychopath Kongregate

1452
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
In order

1453
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,207
To f*** you over

1454
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:23,839
Getaround

1455
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
Squeeze just a human being

1456
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,655
That is a psychopath

1457
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:33,055
As opposed to an actual malicious devil taking over and imbuing them with a psychopathy

1458
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,615
Kernel of Truth

1459
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
Extrapolated

1460
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
People like Alex in order to

1461
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,015
Create this vision of

1462
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,063
A team of psychopath

1463
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,647
Like this idea that yes, power is Blake recycle

1464
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927
Congregate

1465
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
Except which

1466
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,767
I mean it does make some sense if

1467
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
If you don't

1468
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,815
Really understand housing

1469
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,911
Like if there are a ton of psychopath they get together and psychopath together

1470
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
But generally they

1471
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,983
Kimberly work together all that well

1472
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,519
Generators going

1473
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,335
You don't usually see serial killers working as a tea

1474
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,431
The Army that's very very rare

1475
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
Examples of

1476
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:16,063
You have the hillside stranglers

1477
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:23,231
There's way more loan for that is generally people of that mental

1478
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
Frame

1479
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,327
Don't work well with others

1480
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,375
So they can be type A and

1481
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
Focused

1482
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
Driven enough

1483
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,959
To the top of the business world

1484
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,263
Like crushing other people to get up

1485
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:39,871
Stuff like that idea of all banded together

1486
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
To fleece

1487
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,199
The rest of the world challenge

1488
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,479
Say is what they're doing

1489
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Is just

1490
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,343
Psychology work

1491
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,927
Is I would really prefer that if it came down to

1492
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,231
There would be two Psychopaths

1493
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,511
Who

1494
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,839
Who are fighting against two Psychopaths

1495
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
And some of them

1496
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
Could turn off the ray

1497
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
Exactly

1498
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:09,823
Bible songs question who will stop the rain

1499
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
Who won of God's messenger

1500
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:18,015
You're welcome in a purely punitive way for no reason

1501
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
For not respecting God enough

1502
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Yeah if there's a

1503
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
REI

1504
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,463
Really really that's one of the things that I really

1505
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Wish

1506
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
Is that

1507
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
People could

1508
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,559
Get past that

1509
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
Primitive

1510
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,607
Reactionary

1511
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Idea of

1512
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
The way to solve things

1513
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Punishment

1514
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
Like

1515
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,007
Even if got a God's messenger

1516
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Their plan

1517
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,871
Is to f****** punish people who don't like

1518
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,223
Is built into that the hard right

1519
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,271
Evangelico b******* is like

1520
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,831
Of course poor people shouldn't have money

1521
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,647
They need to be punished for being poor

1522
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,439
To get over the poorness

1523
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
Makes perfect sense

1524
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,535
That's the same f****** idea

1525
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,119
Oh oh course these people aren't acting the way God wants

1526
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,423
So we kill them

1527
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:14,079
We don't kill them but where we celebrate that they got killed

1528
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,151
We don't want to have the agency of it they were thrilled

1529
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,687
The result

1530
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
CB Express

1531
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,503
That's gross

1532
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
Engross

1533
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,599
Regarding Palestinians

1534
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
I think that's what I said

1535
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,303
It's not that's what I meant

1536
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
Alright

1537
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,167
12

1538
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:56,063
How much they hated it whenever people had right it's almost like they had a financial incentive

1539
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,671
So anyway

1540
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,207
Eclipse

1541
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,327
I don't want to come up person I don't care cuz I

1542
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
To obvious

1543
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
There is only one

1544
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Ricky Baker

1545
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,591
No I'm going to go with Jim Bakker sister what are you doing lady

1546
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,919

01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:27,551
She was in Israel has unknown sister

1548
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:36,255
Alexandra Thurston color
