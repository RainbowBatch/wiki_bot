Hey everybody welcome back to an hour

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,384
Welcome back to these wonderful

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,248
Slightly less wonderful than they were before you left America States

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
Louder

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
This

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,416
Considerably

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
You did a great job but

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,304
This cannot be replicated

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,656
Whatever we're doing

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,960
The wonderful surprise

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,776
In-depth analysis of Alex Jones's bulshit

14
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:50,432
Market orders that I've ever had

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,296
Like to figure out what my true purpose is here we are super thrilled to be able to help you discover

16
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,856
Again welcome back

17
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,928
We're drinking a wonderful red wines from Bogle Vineyards

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,768
In honor of our Lord and savior vocal

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
Praise be

20
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
We got so much

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
On our plate

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,216
While we analyze the World of Alex Jones and Infowars

23
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
We can't banter back and forth for the first 20 minutes

24
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
The soundry can't do that

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
Through the b*******

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Will definitely stay on target I think honestly the message or the the mission of the show is

27
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
A hundred percent

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
But we have to get through our own bulshit

29
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,840
Yeah,

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,632
On the

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
6th and 27th

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Episode

33
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
Of the Alex Jones

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
I wanted to be up to

35
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
Speed rap

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
The present day

37
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,176
What is AJ

38
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,736
February 1st

39
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Yes

40
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,600
Everyone in on Monday and Tuesday's show the 30th

41
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
A 31st

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
What is it Alex

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
On both episodes

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
It's the last day of January

45
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Give me David Knight both.

46
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,592
The globalist 28th through the 31st

47
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
Months should be modeled on February

48
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Everyday

49
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
The show every morning

50
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
He's shocked

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,672
Reflection everyday

52
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
Goddamn dog

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:45,376
I don't want to cover everything I don't have clips from because it doesn't really matter mostly

54
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Making vague threat

55
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
To the people who might try and hurt Trump 41

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Pluckers

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Institute of Muslim

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,528
Yeah

59
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,624
If the weight of the world on your shoulders like

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,744
Exactly like Alex Jones he wants everyone to know that if something happens

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
The Trump

62
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
You're walking on the

63
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,632
The Fightin side of Alex Jones also he has a

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,216
What is he actually saying that if

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Gets murdered

66
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
It is his personal job.

67
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
To find and bring the killer to Jess

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
No

69
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
He's rallying the

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,016
Can you saying that if it goes down it's time to shoot people in the streets

71
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,160
Alaska is also saying that all you people out there who were fine with Trump being killed

72
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
If it happens

73
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
You will find No Quarter

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh

75
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,144
So it's a good thing to be selling guns gun parts

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
All the parts you need to make a gun

77
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,080
Also is that a big thing that goes over on Mondays show

78
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,896
Like in different parts and then being like

79
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,904
We sell we sold bananas ice cream and then other things that are in bananas

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah big part is he talks about the shooting in

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Nickelback

82
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,631
That got shot up 617 believe

83
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
As we know now

84
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,079
From police reports it was a white dude who is supporter

85
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,175
Literally everybody should have assumed immediately

86
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
It seems like

87
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,087
We live in the world

88
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
That's the sensible approach

89
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Globalist

90
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Zombie

91
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
Search

92
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,887
Realize that what actually happened was that it was Muslim shooting up a mosque

93
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
Because they were the more radical Muslims

94
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
And they were shooting up a progressive Muslim

95
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
You just basically saying

96
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
That like

97
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
The biggest victims of Islam are people who are

98
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Like make the argument that it was

99
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:17,183
Is a failed false flag it was already a failed fault

100
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,023
Because they have tons of people who are out of these airports protesting

101
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
And this false flag happened

102
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Now they're activate

103
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
Now they shut down everything

104
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Chaos Bedlam in the streets

105
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Alright

106
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Wait what

107
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
You don't do not understand the premise

108
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,247
Protesters have been mobilized and paid by George Soros

109
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Gotcha

110
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Are going to

111
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Star Trek

112
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Because of this false flag

113
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Shooting

114
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
NHK back Moss

115
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
So the globalist

116
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Tired

117
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Yes

118
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,751
Fake news

119
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Nope

120
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
Absolutely. It's all complete nonsense

121
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
And the fact make that episode 8

122
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Incredibly embarrassing

123
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
I really want to

124
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
Alex

125
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
Humanity

126
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
Beyond Beyond

127
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,047
He did repeat that claim on Tuesday

128
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,887
Of course he's real doesn't mean

129
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Tell them it's not like they're real I don't really want to dissect

130
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Too deeply because

131
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,895
A tragedy is obviously fake

132
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,479
And I don't really feel super-great about laughing about

133
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
A mass murder

134
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
I don't feel super good about waking up everyday

135
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
I mean

136
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
I wrestle with this like

137
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
If Sandy Hook

138
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Comes back up on his show

139
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
How do we cover that

140
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Cuz he's a denier right yeah

141
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Tell me what do we do I don't

142
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
I don't want to

143
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,895
Well here's what I would like to his craziness but I don't want to diminish

144
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:18,527
Know what it would be is just an hour and 45 minutes of me barking into the microphone

145
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
Like an angry dog

146
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:28,767
Realistically you're probably right

147
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
Do we get a big piece of news

148
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,471
And that is opening up a Washington Bureau of Infowars

149
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,591
Thank you Jesus needed a reason to become relevant

150
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
Yes I got an editor

151
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:51,295
We just got radicalized what just happened right

152
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
Editor

153
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
And this is very exciting

154
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Piece of news

155
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,055
We have to run the Washington Bureau

156
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Corsi

157
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
I don't know if you've ever heard of this cat

158
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Sounds fake

159
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,711
He is a seventy-year-old man

160
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
Who wrote an entire book about

161
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
Barack Obama

162
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Having a fake person

163
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
How do you write an

164
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Book about

165
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Didn't that just a sentence

166
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
I might actually be overstating that he did

167
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,375
Scathing book about Barack Obama's one of his

168
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
Pieces was that Obama has a

169
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,519
True

170
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,103
Well as we know now since he's been deported

171
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
F****** muslim ban

172
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,087
Hold on let me walk back my walking back Jerome corsi wrote the book

173
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
Where's the birth certificate

174
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
A book questions Obama's America

175
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,255
May 2011

176
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,351
The book enjoyed abuzz building teaser article and a heavy heavily trafficked

177
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Drudge Report website

178
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
Whenever Wendy's use that

179
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,015
Also wrote many articles about how the USA is about

180
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
The merge with Mexican

181
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Canada

182
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
That would be fun

183
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
So he's a seventy-year-old

184
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,303
Great tacos maple syrup conglomerate

185
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
I don't know I don't

186
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
I don't know

187
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
You have

188
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
A lot of

189
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Just moving freely among

190
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Enjoying nature

191
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Yeah

192
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:53,407
Basically the big things from Monday and Tuesday is show but now

193
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
It's important that we get back

194
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
To the 26th

195
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Alright

196
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
I remember

197
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
A lot more

198
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
See stuff happened on the 26th and 27th

199
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
We're going to have to wrestle with

200
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,127
Alright what would you rather do

201
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
Choice you get an A or a B

202
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,295
Would you like to do with matters of the east or matters of the South

203
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
God I tried

204
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Assume it's going to be way more racist when we go to

205
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
So let's do it

206
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
Some boy

207
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887

Okay so one of Alex's

210
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
Massive narratives on the 26th

211
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
China

212
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
Points about

213
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
China

214
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:08,671
Stories.com

215
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767

216
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Is Infowars

217
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
Call Noah

218
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,639
No it's just a vlog

219
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Movies I go to see you

220
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,807
Pro communist Chinese propaganda

221
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,719
So will take a little bit of a step back here and

222
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
Unpack this

223
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Chinese

224
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Companies

225
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Maybe

226
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
Just rearrange Chinese Communist and then

227
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
He might be

228
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,311
Yeah

229
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Something like that you know

230
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
These are so he has big feet

231
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
I mean that's fine

232
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
I guess

233
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
Where somebody came from he would probably use that

234
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
After all

235
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
Yeah

236
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
He has this

237
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Sing that he doesn't understand

238
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Massive emerging mark

239
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Especially for entertain

240
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
Yeah so a lot of movies are going to

241
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,823
To be harshly critical of China in the way he might want

242
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
What

243
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Which movies

244
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,759
Really mad at Michael Bay

245
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
Jingoistic filmmaker there's ever been in a minute

246
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
Which is a jerk off americafest

247
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Except for Ben Affleck

248
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
Somebody positive messages about the Chinese

249
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
Revenge of the Fallen Transformers movie

250
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
All these movies that are probably full of

251
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
Chinese propaganda

252
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
That is

253
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Is not possible

254
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,599
Family propaganda of unconventional

255
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Family unit

256
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,439
Yeah Mi cramp a crime involves family

257
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
Astigmatism

258
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,191
The movie is the best

259
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Clips

260
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,223
Any episode of The Alex Jones Show

261
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
Chinese are buying up Hollywood

262
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,695
And in order because one guy

263
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Now it's

264
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
To fully put that b******* to bed

265
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
So

266
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,751
He cites an article on infowars.com

267
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
He's dating

268
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
Something more

269
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Yeah

270
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Otso

271
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,711
It gives it credibility because there's a link to it on Drudge

272
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:17,855
And the only link as a source that they

273
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
Is a

274
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Piece of tech

275
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
Like the Chinese are buying up Hollywood Studios

276
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
I clicked on that

277
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,863
It goes to another

278
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,935
That is just a video clip of Alex

279
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,359
So

280
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,759
Video if you watch it Alex flashes up an article from The Hollywood Reporter

281
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
That is about this guy

282
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Who is the

283
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Very relevant pieces

284
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Information

285
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,535
From that article that Alex willfully ignored

286
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
In order to make his bulshit propaganda points

287
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
You have been

288
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Saving up to

289
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Until you're bringing a lot more

290
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
A quote from the guy Wanda

291
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
The company

292
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,967
That he owns a billionaire

293
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
I wanted to acquire

294
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
The weather has a different story

295
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
It's uncertain

296
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,927
I might as well start from wherever I can such a

297
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Through investment with all 6

298
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Bluntly

299
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,583
Strategy we will continue to work on a potential acquisition

300
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
But it won't

301
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
Participating investment

302
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
It seems like a wise choice for

303
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
The time being

304
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,079
Okay so is plan actually is to buy one of the studio

305
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,431
Yeah and what he's doing to get his foot in the door is investing in all of them

306
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,015
Hoping that sooner or later one of them

307
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,647
Even if you're building a Hollywood studio

308
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,487
Time Warner AOL merger

309
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,583
You know it doesn't happen because one guy is like okay aol's mine now

310
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
Yeah

311
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
Azzam interviews with people who know him and know them

312
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Movie business

313
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
One of them

314
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,663
Closer to the notion that Wanda is motivated where would ever be foolish enough

315
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Have to try and force

316
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Anything resembling

317
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Chinese propaganda

318
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Quote

319
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
Since Hollywood is already altering their films to make them shine

320
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Or at least

321
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
Girl to gain Market access there

322
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
I don't think you wanted to buy into really changed

323
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
To Stanley Rosen

324
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
The professor

325
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
Of political science

326
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
Hola start sending email saying we are under tremendous pressure from to make protein

327
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
China film

328
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
Sing to their business all over the world

329
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
Thomas toll founder and CEO of legendary

330
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Kohl's management team in place

331
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,039
Has given no indication of wanting to save the Studio's contest

332
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
He's an unabashed business

333
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
What is the bottom line

334
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,399
If what he said made sense we wouldn't live in the world we live in what do you mean

335
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Just because he wouldn't put pressure on people

336
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
How to put a proton

337
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
It's like it's like

338
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Whenever they cover

339
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
They don't

340
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Purposefully

341
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Cover

342
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Certain things

343
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Georgia prison

344
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Certain

345
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
The owner

346
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Stead

347
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
But just by the virtue

348
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Two of them being working

349
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
For this guy

350
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
They feel an implicit

351
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
To avoid

352
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,031
Yeah but billionaires one billionaire who knows what they really want

353
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
William

354
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
That's fine if you're putting pro-china

355
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Into something

356
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
That wouldn't be as damaging as people would

357
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,671
Maybe I also think I found the quote from this article that really is what this is all about this is a quote from

358
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Rwanda

359
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Isabel

360
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,655
Oh boy as a businessman I believe he's somewhat successful but not extremely

361
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Successful

362
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,823
Makes money from his name

363
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
But I do consider him to have achieved real success

364
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
He doesn't compare to America's real Megara

365
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
Rich Bill Gates for example or other great-aunt

366
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Turner's

367
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
What this is about

368
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Just

369
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,951
The guy is singing this guy is talking a little bit of s*** and Alex's

370
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,071
Got to make him the figurehead of my full propaganda campaign

371
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,375
Against

372
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,935
You trying to buy all 6 Studios

373
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
Now if you want to hear something else that makes this guy

374
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,943
When I asked when you're the end of our time together what's the

375
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Contemplates the improbable Arc of his life

376
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
He says

377
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
He mostly feels lucky

378
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Lucky to have come of age

379
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
When China was undergoing a

380
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Reform

381
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Quote

382
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,487
30 years ago people in China all had the same life

383
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
We were given rations of food

384
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
The reform gave us the right to

385
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
Virtues and the freedom of choice allowed people with a will and an ambition to achieve

386
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
In the past

387
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
Only if the emperor could

388
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Drink this tea

389
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
Why I said Wang before we part

390
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
With one of his biggest grin

391
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
In the morning

392
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
Today anyone with enough money

393
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Can buy it

394
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,991
That seems like it's right in the vein of f******

395
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Capitalism

396
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
Yeah md-80s they did

397
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
Switch over to a

398
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
One of the big things

399
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
Russia is not a communist Society

400
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
China is not a communist Society

401
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:55,007
What they're using communist is shorthand for isn't oligarchical

402
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Society

403
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
Because

404
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Is not a cyst

405
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
System of governance

406
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Capitalistic

407
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
We talked about this on the first episode

408
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
Alex Jones is

409
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
Ramada socialism leads

410
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,975
Communism and capitalism isn't, authoritarian rule of the state

411
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,071
Right like love we had

412
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,887
To create forever

413
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,543
It looks that way it seems like he wants that right

414
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Trump

415
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
More less

416
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,735
Either way we have differences in opinion on this guy

417
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Oh me too

418
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,183
But as long as we start as far as billionaires go he seems like he's in the top

419
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
B

420
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,255
Like he's the most billionaires

421
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
Yeah

422
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,775
Taking old no way indicates that he wants to buy all 6 Studios

423
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
Mount it has nothing to do with that

424
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Absolutely

425
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,431
Movies with his

426
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,063
And picking the Chinese and Asian stories are underrepresented in the media and stuff like that

427
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,696
And if you have a market share that

428
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,792
Growing movies bomb here gets saved

429
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Buy overseas Market

430
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,168
The red delinia poem

431
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
Warcraft

432
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,568
The one that was based on that ship

433
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,688
Yeah well over there

434
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Because

435
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
They are great movies but they're excited

436
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
They are excited

437
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
The cross culture

438
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Because they're excited

439
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
Alex is pissed about

440
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Some stuff

441
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
About to try,

442
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
It's insulting to America

443
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Of course

444
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
We're going to

445
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,936
And find just a little

446
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
You've got nothing

447
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
Straight face

448
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,384
Hollywood is set to Begin work on Little America

449
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,600

Even more

458
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
A joke

459
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:44,992

But do you realize what was going on there he's got nothing

467
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:35,168
It's so important to illustrate when he has something that he's going on he has nothing

468
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,984
All he has are is that terrible dick joke

Special Forces guys going in to save his own daughter when he billionaires.

00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
I suppose instead of it being the plot to

00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
It's once removed the plot to take

505
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760

That's worse than Doctor Robotnik Sonic games

575
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
So f****** fake Final Fantasy 10

576
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,704
So Alex wants to wrap up with the

577
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,032
The Hollywood storyline

578
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
This

579
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Little gem

580
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,224
And they're openly

581
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:24,160
I almost want to say to all the evil people who want to serve this.

582
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
Crazy people

583
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Screaming kill Trump and for other students

584
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,424
I hear the students freaking out the background

585
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,520
So he's talking about a cliff he played earlier of a teacher

586
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,080
Projector screen

587
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
In her classroom of the Trump inauguration

588
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
Water gun

589
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Shooting at the things I

590
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,040
But also I don't know if

591
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,416
I don't think it's from the clip

592
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
You really

593
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:03,584
It is no indication there's anyone else in the room lights

594
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
She might have been

595
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,216
I don't know that to be true I have no idea

596
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
From

597
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
Source given

598
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
It could just be I mean

599
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Was it a false

600
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
It might have been

601
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
The dirty.

602
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
Vistaprint

603
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,536
You're running your mouth your going to get hurt

604
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,608
Talk s*** get hit

605
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,912
Running my mouth

606
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Look what

607
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
We've done

608
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
In 21 years

609
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
Information War

610
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:56,320
Everybody has really gotten normalcy bias a learned helplessness

611
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
Or we just accept

612
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
And I'm sorry

613
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:07,584
Trump Easter

614
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
It's going down

615
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
So fast

616
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,496
But he needs to come out now

617
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
Has any

618
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,176
I bet you can't

619
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Liana Brackett

620
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,136
Domino's Watson and his brother

621
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,256
This is an electronic cultural Red Dawn by the

622
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,376
They're going to keep us in line

623
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Now I need

624
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,568
To ask you to enjoy a sip of wine

625
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,896
Cuz what about to happen is a string of

626
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Crazy threats

627
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
That are

628
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
Sacrifice thousand dollars

629
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,488
First of all there's no way he could afford to do that

630
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
At all

631
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
He couldn't do that

632
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,704
Jesus went into the money changers

633
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,776
Because they were screwing up the temple in the sacred place

634
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
Broken

635
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
But here's where he

636
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,736
The weasel

637
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Has he ever read

638
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
Probably

639
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:09,440
Calendar something like that

640
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Like those

641
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,816
Work memes

642
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
At an office which is probably

643
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Keep your chin up

644
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Border

645
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
I think we got a verse right here

646
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
2nd Thessalonians 3

647
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
New calendar

648
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Pray for us

649
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
But the word of the Lord may have

650
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
Free course and be glorified

651
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
Even as it is with you

652
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Oh well then

653
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
Avocado

654
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Sing where he's going to be like

655
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,672
Showing everyone's decadence

656
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
And showing everyone's Love of Money

657
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,048
But here's

658
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
What is a weasel

659
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:02,176
Azerfreedom everything else does

660
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,720
It's just a form of advertising

661
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
Buck

662
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,144
His whole life is a metaphorical

663
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
No the only reason today

664
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,848
Jester have any power is the sacrificing of the

665
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,640
These are manipulative suck

666
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,944
Understand most of what anything

667
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Looked away my hands up

668
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
Here is where the

669
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Start

670
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
Okay

671
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
So

672
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,184
Fuckingawesome

673
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Zach call

674
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,920
The whole pie

675
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
Or your business work with you

676
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,904
Not working and brainwashed everything's going to burn down

677
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,936
I want to go to war

678
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
Visit

679
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,864
That was f******. That was

680
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
That's crazy

681
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
That was

682
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,240
That was from Troy

683
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:07,360
Rage

684
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Cheeses that

685
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
How how f******

686
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Fake is that anger

687
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
That was

688
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:26,048
Religious fervor to that

689
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,120
In the middle

690
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:34,496
Like I can't even do his voice when I yell at

691
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:39,360
Stove

692
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,432
Lord bring them low

693
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,480
Bricks

694
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Swing low

695
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
Weedjies

696
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:54,976
I don't really know

697
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
Remember what it is

698
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:01,120
The label inside jerk-off fantasy about scum

699
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
So

700
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
Probably pretty anchors

701
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
And their whole future is based on how well we do

702
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,440
They're delusional because they imagine they're with the power structure

703
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,792
And they believe because they're in

704
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,224
Weather

705
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,624
Publix, Traders are

706
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:31,488
You're all going to be held up as the standard of Filth

707
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,840
You defeat will will will

708
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
Millennium

709
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,800
Supporters

710
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,384
You truly have created

711
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,736
Fallen scared frightened confused metal bases

712
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,440
Far gone I've seen them

713
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,232
They're gone

714
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Weather

715
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:16,544
Madonna the opposite of the beautiful spirit of Womanhood you are monsters

716
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,200
You are what you claim men are trying to do

717
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:29,600
You're there to dominate The Spirit of women

718
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Lose Yourself

719
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
In the metaphysical version of who was that

720
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
Famous Royal that would kill babies and bathe in their blood

721
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,264
Let's go out to break

722
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
Wait did he say that

723
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
A rich Act

724
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Purses

725
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
Will know that the Cosmetic products

726
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,135
Project Veritas videos something like that

727
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,927
I feel like you might be right

728
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,999
I'm not sure but I feel

729
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,847
What did they switch to babies to save money like what happened on Shark Tank

730
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,223
Mister mister wonderful or whatever

731
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
I put them in actresses lips

732
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,599
20 million dollars

733
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
What bank

734
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:43,071
It seems bizarre

735
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,607
You're good at busy

736
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Cuz we're in

737
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Shockingly accurate that was just

738
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,847
AJ / 0 Phantom

739
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,711
He will be held up as the examples

740
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
If you're going to win a war

741
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
Culture War

742
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,111
I would say don't tell other people

743
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,951
Bond villain lair

744
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Keep that a secret

745
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Like it's not just good

746
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:18,655
It's like a Bond movie where the guy gives away too much in the bottoms up

747
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:25,055
Well now that we know how we're going to be just don't know how we're going to be held

748
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
Generations

749
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Succumb

750
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
Scum

751
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,967
Also

752
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,295
Basically what he said is to irrelevant

753
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
Older women

754
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
Sucking at the Spirit of

755
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Real woman

756
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Right here

757
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,767
Madonna gave a speech at the women's March

758
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
And she mentioned

759
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,911
Yeah but in it she said that she at times feels like she wants

760
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,703
How to blow up the White House but she does

761
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,775
Yeah and that's taken out of context and

762
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
No

763
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,639
Positive does Madonna have the resources to

764
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:06,271
She was married to Guy Ritchie and he's been known to do a lot of caper movies

765
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,343
Great

766
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,415
No cuz it wouldn't sell that.

767
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,719
Swept Away whatever the movie

768
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:21,119
Amazon fire box office

769
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,447
And Sherlock Holmes is going to

770
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
The White House being a

771
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Exploded by a bomb

772
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
Baja

773
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
But

774
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,895
He's going to be radical

775
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
Sure sure sure

776
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Radicalized

777
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
No no

778
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
Watson

779
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,463
It just a blind follower okay until the very end

780
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
Is Martin Freeman

781
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Is amazing

782
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,327
But he's not in the movie version

783
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,143
Subway is Moriarty a patriot

784
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Where's your globalist

785
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
I mean

786
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
Okay well it's

787
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
Alex Jones

788
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Moriarty's unabashed app

789
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,575
People who need

790
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
People need weapons

791
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,719
It's supply and demand

792
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Does that make us

793
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:25,887
Holmes and Watson I mean my last name is home so I'm going to take

794
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,287
I'm going to take

795
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,455
Unhinged the opiates

796
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
So

797
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
Do we had all this

798
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
This Tricom stuff that's weird

799
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
Jackoff fantasy

800
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:51,999
But that's not all Alex was on on the 26th is also into another narrative

801
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,071
That has to do with why it's totally cool

802
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
To build a wall

803
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Explain

804
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,639
Because he said in Spanish

805
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,343
Trouble

806
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,743
I'm going to have to f****** ask you not to talk over these quick

807
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:28,863
Other Mexico we're going to have an affair conversation on app

808
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,703
Agree with you that.

809
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,239
Of course

810
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
We need to stop talking over Clips alright I'm sorry I want to give you your 40 I want to keep this

811
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,711
Trump card this Donald Trump card

812
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,879
God help me deposit of a point

813
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
I'm sorry

814
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Homes

815
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
You speak in Spanish which is already suspect

816
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
Well

817
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,775
No

818
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,567
English or nothing a******

819
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,895
Getting out of it

820
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,431
If it's defending English

821
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,623
Bubble

822
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,439
Basically what Mexico's economy collapse

823
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
And

824
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,095
It's a good thing

825
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
Turn of the premise

826
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,679
And this narrative

827
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,543
But they have a wall with Guatemala

828
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,103
And their hypocritical because they want us

829
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
To not have a wall between the United

830
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Do they have a

831
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Nope

832
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,575
No but isn't that the Bedrock of his

833
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
Yep

834
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
But it doesn't exist

835
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
I would encourage

836
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Everyone

837
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
Listening

838
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
To look up some pictures of

839
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:05,887
The border between Guatemala and Mexico know there's gorgeous

840
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:12,287
It's just gorgeous Lush nature beautiful

841
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,359
But you if you do Google it you'll find some meme

842
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,175
Of people who have posted pictures

843
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
Purporting to be a wall

844
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
Between Mexico

845
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
Guatemala

846
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
And if you reverse image search

847
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Bu

848
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
You find

849
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,415
Better bunch of them

850
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,975
Between Mexico and Arizona

851
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
Therapy

852
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,047
That's between Mexico and Arizona

853
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:40,447
Reported to be between

854
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
New Mexico

855
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Guatemala it is not

856
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
Another one they have

857
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
That Alex put on

858
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:52,223
On Infowars

859
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Is

860
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,575
A giant wall in Israel

861
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,927
Purported to be between Mexico and Guatemala

862
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
It's not

863
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
It's b*******

864
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
F******

865
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
Can you do that

866
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,655
He doesn't not know

867
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
He's a liar

868
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
Absolutely is lying

869
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
If not

870
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,103
She's literally the worst journalist in the world

871
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Cuz I figured that out with

872
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
3 seconds on Google

873
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,503
Okay but here's

874
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,647
Meme of there being 3 million immigrants

875
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,463
Illegal immigrant to vote

876
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Of course

877
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Think there was a good to be

878
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
What is there a 10000000

879
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:49,055
How come you like the number the 3 million is already

880
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
It's not

881
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,711
Studies

882
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,807
Everytime I assure you I assure you will get back

883
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
I'm just saying

884
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,207
It's something that was based on no evidence there was actually just

885
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
AIDS

886
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,511
From a guy

887
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
They just

888
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
Just f******

889
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,167
Exploded

890
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,495
Who tweeted that he had three million cases of voter fraud

891
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,567
Himself is registered in three states

892
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:25,407
Okay also also owes 100,000

893
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
Who's right

894
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
We all make mistakes

895
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:33,855
Because it's not related to what he's talking about is in 3

896
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,903
States registered which is part of what keys

897
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
Supporting to brutalight

898
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:41,023
And he's a response right when he was cold bicyclist was

899
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
I don't know I didn't

900
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Know that

901
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,607
Of course you didn't

902
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,423
That anybody was registered but doesn't know

903
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,983
I'm probably registered in Illinois and Missouri

904
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
I probably did

905
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,799
Cancel my registration when I move

906
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,823
Can you do that

907
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
What ya cancel your registration

908
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:00,735
I didn't know I don't know both Hill annoy and Missouri

00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,831
Is there any questions about my voting have

911
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,671
But also say

912
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
You don't

913
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
If you want them

914
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,023
Are you auditing

915
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
Look straight up here's my W2

00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,751
Tell the audience I'm showing you my W2 literally right

918
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,335

00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:49,887
Can't live on that b******* in Chicago

924
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
Alex has more thoughts about Mexico in this wall

925
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Keep your eyes open

926
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
Four-way more lies

927
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:02,943
Play the clips of the Mexican president

928
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
Choices on how do that

929
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:18,559
You just broke the rule that you had

930
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:24,959
Mission of interrupting rhino

931
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Interrupt

932
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,311
Everything so much things like well

933
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,455
This this Cliff actually is

934
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,039
So that is being the running

935
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
Theme of the show

936
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
He's very scared

937
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
The last week

938
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,391
Week or so

939
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
I don't blame him

940
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:51,327
Cuz the more facts that start to come to light in the more we realize like General Flynn just erase

941
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Erased his Twitter account

942
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,679
Like it really looks like

943
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
He's being investigated hard

944
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,799
Cleo legal documents

945
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
Destruction

946
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,359
Yep when you're official

947
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
All digital dropbox

948
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
F******

949
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Incriminate

950
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,807
It does kind of look like the world is closed

951
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Around

952
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,623
The people in power

953
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,231
I don't know it's going to be a very weird world

954
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,767
I don't know I'm very scared

955
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
But he is too he's using

956
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,143
Instead of owning up to the fear and being like

957
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
Things I maybe I'm on the wrong team

958
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,007
That is

959
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,055
A normal human might do

960
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
No no

961
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,943
Here's a why I was thinking about this earlier because my my parents

962
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
And my aunt

963
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Still think that

964
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,295
They're still on the give him a chance

965
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
Let's train

966
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
I really

967
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
And I will tell you the reason

968
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
I

969
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
Went through all of the

970
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
Conservative websites

971
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
It's while I was researching

972
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,559
Or do I just do this with all news

973
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,863
Because of this Muslim ban thing

974
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,655
I'm trying to figure out

975
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Personal stories

976
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
Who word

977
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
F******

978
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
Translators in Iraq

979
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,895
Did any of these facts

980
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
Ever will even get the

981
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:15,551
The chance to get away is it is impossible for us to ever to

982
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,111
Family members who've been murdered

983
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,927
For their association with the USA

984
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,719
Still because they thought it was the right

985
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:29,119
F****** thing to do

986
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Still help

987
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Henwy

988
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
Promised

989
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
Get out

990
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
Because of their service

991
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
The f****** muslim ban

992
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,639
And if you read these stories there's no

993
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
Possible way

994
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,431
There's no

995
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,479
F****** possible way you can defend

996
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,271
Nope

997
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
Conservative websites

998
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
0 of them

999
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
One person

1000
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
They did not interview

1001
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:59,071
Even bother with it instead they went with The Narrative of like

1002
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:02,143
1 *

1003
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
This guy

1004
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,983
Who saved our f****** soldiers lives

1005
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
Is being blocked

1006
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:15,199
Further Narrative of

1007
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,039
Like there's been a lot of that s*** going on for a long time

1008
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:22,879
Sir alonne that is

1009
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,671
That has been going on for a while

1010
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,487
Because of our extreme wedding program

1011
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,351
Arabian place

1012
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:36,447
Extreme already the cockamamie b******* is like

1013
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
We're just letting people in

1014
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
No no no

1015
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
Harder to get in

1016
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,919
Personal stories

1017
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
And if

1018
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Just put that because I can

1019
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
Give them real news

1020
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
They don't believe in real news

1021
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,647
Conservative websites started running

1022
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,927
Personal

1023
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
Testimonials

1024
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
From this muscle

1025
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
Immediately

1026
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
All of these all of these

1027
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
Conservative people

1028
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,887
Who genuinely do believe themselves to have

1029
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Compassion

1030
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,215
If they actually started reading these doors

1031
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
There's no

1032
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,359
Possible way they could still support the version of personal stories with those conservative sites

1033
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,919
Literally everybody

1034
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,967
They could talk about their experience

1035
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,247
It's not being killed by it

1036
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,855
You could do a puff piece on how great it is to not be killed by immigrants

1037
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:33,535
$13,000

1038
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,583
So do I

1039
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
Towards the Mex

1040
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Again

1041
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,103
Mexico gets hundreds of billions of dollars a year of money sent back down to it

1042
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:56,575
Anon

1043
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,415
Mexico's business to make sure the Trump

1044
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,183
Looks like

1045
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,487
Do you follow through

1046
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,767
Promise

1047
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:09,375
Doesn't make any sense though they're getting

1048
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,447
The hundreds of billions that they are not getting

1049
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:17,567
No they're not getting as much as you might imagine

1050
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Crazy

1051
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
It's more like it's more like 5 million

1052
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:28,575
Play concern back to their families

1053
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,647
And it's not like it's gotten games

1054
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,183
It's not like a jailbreak

1055
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:39,583
Earn money and send it to their family

1056
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,399
And you're talking about basically robbing

1057
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
Great

1058
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
Relationship in

1059
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,079
Because they're not allowed to send money back

1060
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:55,967
To chip in as a show of solidarity to make sure that Trump follows through with his

1061
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,015
Because otherwise he would look like

1062
00:57:59,295 --> 00:57:59,807
Hold on

1063
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
It gets worse

1064
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,671
It was a both of the campaign

1065
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
One way or another

1066
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,287
I see what is about to happen

1067
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
Gracious

1068
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,711
Came up here and negotiated baby

1069
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,015
Facebook page for third of it or something

1070
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
But Mexico didn't do that

1071
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,647
One way or another in

1072
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,463
Trump knows America Fields demoralize

1073
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,095
As important as brainwashed position

1074
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,519
Vautour

1075
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:04,831
Play the clip from Mexican president

1076
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,903
Is it in Spanish

1077
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
See

1078
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,743
Any of his

1079
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
Listeners speaks

1080
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,631
If he plays that clip-ins

1081
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
Anderson they don't speak

1082
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,983
Dismiss translate if you want it

1083
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,615
So you couldn't get away with it on video

1084
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,919
The idea for his

1085
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:36,575
Radio show the ideas get the money one way or another is second

1086
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343
What's going to happen

1087
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Yeah basically

1088
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:49,631
But the thing that I take much more issue with is the ID

1089
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,935
Theories like Americans are brainwashed into picking

1090
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,519
Yeah absolutely

1091
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Yeah

1092
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,615
That was the ID laws were part of the Jim Crow

1093
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:05,247
Racial profiling and it's been found that way in court

1094
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Multiple times

1095
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,623
Repeatedly

1096
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,951
Largely bracelet

1097
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,023
Related

1098
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,559
Income brackets

1099
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,119
Are much less likely to have IDs

1100
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,423
Is there also

1101
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,983
You're more likely to vote Democrat

1102
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,799
Because the Democrats are the only people who even

1103
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,847
Pretend to give a s*** about them

1104
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,151
If he was like

1105
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
After being able to read

1106
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,527
Order to vote

1107
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,343
Your grandfather

1108
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
But it seems

1109
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
Parcel

1110
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,511
Yeah it's not the same thing but it within its it is within that territory

1111
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
He's defending

1112
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
Classically racist

1113
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
Tactics

1114
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,399
To get people to not be able to vote

1115
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,751
Can we feel dirty for wanting these things

1116
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
Better than him

1117
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Defending

1118
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
Isn't being read

1119
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,687
No it's actually the same f****** day

1120
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
He's not defending modern ways of rain

1121
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
Hoarding them as a

1122
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
F******

1123
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,367
Is the Avatar of modern

1124
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
James Cameron

1125
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,471
We all know Titanic

1126
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
Is American propagate

1127
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
False

1128
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,079
False flag

1129
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:46,111
Leather nuke each other

1130
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:56,863
Administration

1131
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,703
Did that not

1132
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,799
Did Nazis do that

1133
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,359
They did do that

1134
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:13,759
Very much are we supporting their tactics are we not

1135
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,879
This house would put out a report of immigrant crime

1136
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
Is one of the most

1137
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,023
Straight propaganda

1138
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,607
Demonizing overpopulation things ever it's

1139
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,959
Literally if they start doing that

1140
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,983
We've got a

1141
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,383
A start riot

1142
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
Beyond the report

1143
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
Wheel repair

1144
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
Peacefully protesting now

1145
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
If he starts

1146
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,807
Doing full-on Nazi shitla

1147
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,831
Like we have to fight

1148
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,439
I mean it's bad enough that the other night American Primus fighting Nazis

1149
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,767
He's like isn't that are definitely a joke

1150
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:03,935
Indiana Jones's it's bad enough that the other ninety fire that attorney general

1151
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
Pure that way

1152
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,567
Was pure Animal Farm

1153
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:13,151
Is there any press releases put out afterwards that he had

1154
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,551
She had disrespected the president

1155
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,879
It was some weird emotional words

1156
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,647
Could not

1157
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
Possibly bring

1158
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,351
It's exactly what it was

1159
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,887
It was propaganda against

1160
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
It was

1161
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,471
Even if you're the most

1162
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,799
Base level analysis like you're the f****** New York Times

1163
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Trying your best

1164
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
Neutral

1165
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,711
It's clearly she said that you wouldn't break the

1166
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
Institution

1167
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
And he fired her

1168
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,551
Before it hit the brick

1169
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,599
Exactly what he did

1170
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,415
Which is like hey goodbye

1171
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
Constitution

1172
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:01,791
And the other part of it is the idea that the Attorney General is supposed to be

1173
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,583
PA political and unrelated

1174
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
2

1175
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
The Winds of

1176
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,399
The president

1177
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,983
So that's already breakdown

1178
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:15,615
Clear the end of the Constitution

1179
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
Yeah

1180
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,455
You might as well just peed on the counter

1181
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:25,855
Nicolas Cage didn't steal the Declaration of Independence like we all hoped he would

1182
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
Whitlock

1183
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,559
I mean all the people who were super alarm is there were saying that we're not going to have a chance in 28

1184
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Teen

1185
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:40,959
There's not going to be probably a fair 2020 election

1186
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
Pretty bad

1187
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:50,431
Ham days into presidency

1188
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:55,295
Too late and I believe on Election Day we were texting and you're like

1189
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,623
We got to get out of here hopefully we go to sleep

1190
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,183
We do we do

1191
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
Badoo

1192
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,743
We do

1193
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:13,215
Wilson Realty

1194
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,519
This could become Danger

1195
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:23,711
All we want to do is laugh at this jackass

1196
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,783
Liquid jitomate leave yet want to be like paranoid

1197
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,831
Spin

1198
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,623
Stared fantasies

1199
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:37,535
I mean we've already gotten would give anything for these to be scared without publicizing

1200
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,119
Without publicizing the show at all we've

1201
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,679
Gotten a couple tweets from Alex Jones

1202
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
Thankfully just

1203
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
In the realm of

1204
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
But actually

1205
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:53,407
But actually explanations that he has reserved for women or even just like us

1206
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
I think I got one

1207
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:00,319
Why you want terrorist then I saw that there was no doubt

1208
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,879
Supernanny

1209
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,511
As it grows we're going to get the attention of weirdo people

1210
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,399
I'm looking forward to seeing what real online bullying

1211
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,703
Only ever heard of it

1212
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:23,103
Bring it will have a conversation with you most of our points will be

1213
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,127
We like

1214
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,151
Other folks

1215
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,455
We like people

1216
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,759
Anyway

1217
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,319
Their government

1218
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,343
Underscore

1219
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,391
The government is going to release

1220
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
Report

1221
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,719
Immigrant crime

1222
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,255
I am

1223
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
Beginning of eclipse

1224
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
Just so what happens next

1225
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:51,007
Trump Administration

1226
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,103
Coming to an end

1227
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,855
What are you living

1228
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,719
Do you think we're stupid

1229
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:17,375
Mexico has a wall

1230
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,143
Guatemala

1231
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:28,639
The reason that he's saying the fence in places in a wall and other pictures of Arizona

1232
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,407
Okay

1233
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,991
You fucken understand

1234
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Does he

1235
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
Does he believe

1236
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,135
Set those are on the southern border bottom

1237
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
He doesn't

1238
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,279
40 completely bald faced lie

1239
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,607
Based on everything that I've been able to glean from other things

1240
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
I think he's involved

1241
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:56,031
Play Sly I think he truly believes it disagreement on this

1242
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
Disagree office

1243
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
You stink but here's

1244
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,431
The thing you see those leaks from the Trump

1245
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
Like there's a underground

1246
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,527
The POTUS resist

1247
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,415
The Twitter account

1248
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,839
Fanfics like

1249
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:24,959
Anthony atamanuik Trump

1250
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
Annabelle 2

1251
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,847
Fake

1252
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,199
Fake things often absent reality

1253
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
With those fake things

1254
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,111
On the f****** news

1255
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
Where is Sean Spicer

1256
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
Kellyanne Conway

1257
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,975
Alternative facts

1258
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
Billy said we were going

1259
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
Searching for the

1260
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
3 million

1261
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
Immigrants

1262
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
That boat

1263
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
3 million illegal

1264
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
Very clear that

1265
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
Nutpods

1266
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,263
Also Alex

1267
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,335
Alex Jones claims

1268
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,919
It's not true Alex Jones claims that the mainstream media came up with

1269
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,711
The term alternative facts

1270
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,015
When it was actually kellyanne Conway

1271
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,623
Other than news

1272
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,887
I think you truly were.

1273
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,191
I'm saying

1274
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
Because Trump

1275
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
Believe it

1276
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
I don't think he's

1277
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
He's lying

1278
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Okay

1279
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,847
Okay

1280
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,871
I'm going to say that

1281
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895
Alex Jones

1282
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,943
The Ring of believing

1283
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,479
That those two things

1284
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,295
Not like

1285
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
I think he believes

1286
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,183
Steve lied to himself so well

1287
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:55,583
I think I'm coming from a slightly different place when you because often I am watching

1288
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:59,167
Like sometimes I'm just listening but also I'm watching

1289
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,751
I have noticed he has a nervous

1290
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
Tech

1291
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:07,103
Appel

1292
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,895
You going to play poker with him liking

1293
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:12,735
Casino Royale

1294
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,807
Full House

1295
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,367
Every time he does this but it's not very glaring

1296
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,695
The basketball player

1297
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,863
When I was a kid

1298
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,887
I love John

1299
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
John Stockton

1300
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
I also love John

1301
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Number one

1302
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:38,335
Little racist

1303
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:41,407
I also love Larry Bird Larry

1304
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,999
I like John Stockton because he was very selfless

1305
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,047
I like being his big thing was a

1306
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,351
I like that I thought that was cool

1307
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,887
I don't think that

1308
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,055
Whenever he would take

1309
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,103
Free throw he would rub his face

1310
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,127
Because it was

1311
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,431
Is his way of saying hi to his kids back at home

1312
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,271
And I noticed it before any of the commentators

1313
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
Explained it

1314
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Rubbing his face

1315
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,159
It's the same thing with Alex

1316
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,439
I don't know

1317
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,231
Exactly the point.

1318
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
Does this

1319
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
That's how

1320
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,031
Is the top of his right ear he aggressively rub

1321
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,823
And I don't know if

1322
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,127
He just had some weird like

1323
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,199
I don't

1324
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,039
Every time

1325
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
It's like

1326
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:58,975
In the future I will keep track of what he's saying when he does it and see if it matches up with anything

1327
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
Zodiac

1328
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,071
Style spreadsheet effect

1329
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
Google Drive

1330
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:14,079
Now they're going to finish it up as a big strong wall because Latin America is collapsing

1331
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,431
South of the Border

1332
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:25,855
Have a sovereign country if you don't have

1333
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
Control board

1334
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:38,911
We have a wall or has one

1335
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,959
Mexico has won

1336
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,263
So he's referencing the great Waltz

1337
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
Today is

1338
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:47,871
River resources

1339
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,687
It didn't work at all

1340
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:57,087
But also the Great Wall was created because there was literally the greatest War technician of all time

1341
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,695
With hordes

1342
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
Warriors

1343
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,815
Favorite favorite

1344
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,375
My favorite Futurama B

1345
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,655
Is where

1346
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,447
They break down the Great Wall in

1347
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:28,063
I wouldn't call fighting against I've also done a little bit of research into

1348
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
Do the Great Wall over the years

1349
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,903
Because you text me with me

1350
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:36,255
It was me

1351
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:41,887
Yeah it originally was just like a mud wall but it was always because that

1352
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
That that stretch

1353
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,495
Area in the north of China was in

1354
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,823
Forever

1355
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591
Ever

1356
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:56,223
Through the kingdom periods and it was always

1357
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
Just turmoil

1358
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
It would be

1359
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,111
It's insane to compare that

1360
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
To Mexico

1361
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:07,999
Also Mexico

1362
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
And the Vatican

1363
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
Which

1364
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Good enough

1365
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,911
I am not going to

1366
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
Possibly

1367
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:19,007
But that's not the exam having a wall is not where I'm going to pick a fight

1368
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:25,663
I think that's the one that we should do

1369
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:31,295
I may or may not support that

1370
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
Great Wall of China

1371
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,671
You're talking out of your ass what about the Wailing

1372
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,767
Doesn't bring that one up but get this

1373
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
He has one

1374
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,071
Oh no

1375
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
Drop the clip

1376
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,679
Just like Adidas

1377
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:51,007
It's way better than the original Great Wall

1378
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,543
Lunacy

1379
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,615
Quarryville bomb has one

1380
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,711
Mark Zuckerberg wants one sugarburg has like 700

1381
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,527
But there's other little pieces of property

1382
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,319
Saturn

1383
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:10,975
Doesn't want to have any neighbors force them to yourself

1384
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,799
The Mexican president

1385
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
What are you talkin about

1386
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,687
Zuckerberg

1387
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,527
No Mark Zuckerberg apparently is building like a compound Hawaii

1388
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,343
Just at home

1389
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,183
The same look like Peter Thiel is going is fleet

1390
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,231
Excuse me

1391
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
He gets f*****

1392
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,303
Walking murders

1393
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,863
Pray like

1394
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:54,751
List of billionaires in every night before I go to sleep okay with needles

1395
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,663
Is that

1396
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
Saturn

1397
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,527
Sure

1398
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:12,415
Dude just don't kill us more less comedians black

1399
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:20,607
Peter Thiel is brought up

1400
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
Here's the thing

1401
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,703
One of his

1402
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007
20 Nae

1403
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
Indian Island

1404
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,431
Yeah

1405
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
Timberlake golf

1406
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,759
I think accidentally

1407
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:41,087
The last is going to all fulfill the

1408
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,879
The prophecy of an ran

1409
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
Even though they hate her

1410
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,231
Lexus

1411
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:52,095
Is all the important people in society just give up

1412
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,191
And like say alright we're not going to f****** get it we're not going to be involved in the

1413
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,263
So you think the left is going to give up

1414
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,799
I think that there was going

1415
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
Tacoma time

1416
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,847
Possibly

1417
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:07,199
That a lot of people on the last are going to be like this is no longer country I support

1418
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,479
I think I'll probably do it

1419
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Protest

1420
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
Walkout

1421
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
Strike

1422
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Stuff like that

1423
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,647
Where is John Galt

1424
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
Just disappearing

1425
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,719
Did you cancel your Uber account

1426
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,559
I will cancel it

1427
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:28,959
Here's the thing I got an email from there I was busy that night

1428
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,495
Person

1429
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,823
I was busy that night I saw a bunch of tweets about how difficult it was

1430
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,847
I'm just not up for

1431
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,151
For this right now I'll keep the app but I'm not going to

1432
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,175
Two step

1433
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,503
They canceled their account and then

1434
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
Later

1435
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
They had not been

1436
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
Fraudulent

1437
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,303
I'm hearing that canceling your account is way more.

1438
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
Difficult than you think

1439
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
God

1440
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
Patty is that like

1441
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:07,103
Mark Zuckerberg has property

1442
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:13,503
Under English law is still

1443
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,879
Honolulu in Honolulu

1444
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,439
I don't remember ever coming up with English,

1445
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Yeah

1446
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,071
I don't know on the phone he's another

1447
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,863
Immediately

1448
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,191
Comedian who lived in Hawaii we can figure it out also

1449
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,495
Move Along

1450
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:41,151
This is going to be a long-ass episode today

1451
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:47,295
Kermit

1452
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
It was not

1453
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,343
Just China and Max

1454
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,647
Kowall issues on the 26th

1455
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
Alex also had another big

1456
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,511
Piece of news you wanted to break about everyone's favorite

1457
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,327
Jewish Boogeyman

1458
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,863
Well Soros

1459
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:05,727
The Golem

1460
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:10,591
Has been naked shorting out of stock market has everything he's got

1461
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,663
Magically

1462
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,711
Regulators

1463
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,551
Dutch regulator this is Bloomberg

1464
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,879
Accidentally soros's short positions

1465
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,559
World

1466
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,591
And now his positions have been releasing it turns out he was betting against

1467
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,639
America

1468
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:53,599
It's been blowing up in this goblins face and it's beautiful

1469
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,903
Again we have to repeat Goblin

1470
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:02,303
Is a very stereotypical Jew

1471
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,327
Cosmetic

1472
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,863
David

1473
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,423
Classic Jewish stereotype

1474
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,959
So

1475
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,007
This did happen

1476
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,336
He's not he's not telling the truth

1477
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
What's up

1478
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
It's a short

1479
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:24,064
Deshawn everything right now cuz we haven't ascended Market if I if I had enough money I would do the whole big

1480
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,344
Short thing again

1481
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,880
And just take a short

1482
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
Position

1483
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,952
Because this bubble is going to f******

1484
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:35,072
But I think it's sketchy

1485
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,120
It elicits negative reaction

1486
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,936
Because the idea of short bedding

1487
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
Is

1488
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,264
That you want things to fail

1489
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,056
It's the same way that if you go to the

1490
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:49,152
Casino people think it's rude at the roulette table to bet on double zero

1491
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,736
Because if you bet your bedding for everyone else to lose

1492
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,064
There's sort of a there's an idea that decorum

1493
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,600
Is upset by that

1494
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
But that's Wall Street

1495
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:04,768
Everybody short everything all the time if you didn't sure thing

1496
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:05,792
Other people

1497
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,096
Take the opposite position

1498
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:14,496
He is talking to people who don't play the market in so they will believe these ingrained things about

1499
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,896
If you didn't have an alternate buyer who is better things to go well

1500
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
It wouldn't be

1501
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,944
Possible

1502
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,856
When was that people are are moving on

1503
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
ProTech

1504
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
To all over

1505
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,000
Which ones are those

1506
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,816
So then

1507
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,352
Keyboard marching against

1508
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
Thesaurus evil

1509
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
Extensive

1510
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,216
Looking into this I could not find

1511
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
Single source

1512
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
Amy March

1513
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,568
Against the ropes

1514
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,360
Any country in the world

1515
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
For this

1516
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Time.

1517
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
What time.

1518
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,760
I looked for

1519
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,064
I looked for anyting

1520
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,112
And I couldn't find Jerome Martin

1521
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:08,000
Ever look into the story cuz the positions were accidentally revealed

1522
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,280
On this website

1523
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
Which is

1524
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:11,840
Illegal

1525
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:16,192
Yes but it was a complete accident a bunch of other people short positions

1526
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
Reveal to

1527
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:21,824
Basically if you have a short position under 2%

1528
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,128
I believe is a threshold you don't have to report it

1529
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,688
But if you're over that you have to report it

1530
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,760
And if it's above 5% it has to be

1531
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:35,392
Cuz if you're betting a master short on something

1532
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:42,304
Then other people are going to take that as a signal that either you have inside

1533
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,352
Information sure you think something

1534
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Things about the fair

1535
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:49,984
Mystery

1536
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,800
What's them people are going to be like maybe he knows some

1537
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,152
I read about 20 articles

1538
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,968
Warren Buffett

1539
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,248
Too bad this thing is going to

1540
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,784
Succeed other people

1541
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,088
He's a good investor

1542
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
Exactly

1543
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,184
Influence that he actually in

1544
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:15,584
Know if you want it look at this side of that George has lost about a billion dollars shorting

1545
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,888
Do you like Dow Jones

1546
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
After Trump

1547
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,008
So which was it

1548
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,056
Historically just because after

1549
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
Herbert Hoover

1550
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,384
That was the last time that

1551
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
The market was that

1552
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
Okay

1553
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,784
What

1554
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Hooverville

1555
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,160
He's like 26

1556
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,208
6 billion dollars

1557
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,024
He gives away

1558
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Tons of it

1559
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:49,632
But it's also like a billion dollars is a big hit

1560
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
Absorb

1561
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,472
Besides that I could find

1562
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,776
I like I said I read about 20 articles on this

1563
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,592
Even some weirdo blog

1564
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,384
And no one could

1565
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,432
No one could cite anything

1566
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
3 shorted other

1567
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,248
Then to

1568
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,272
Institutions

1569
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,064
When was the Dutch bag

1570
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,344
I called ing

1571
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,136
And the other was a

1572
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,440
The German lending giant douchebag

1573
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,488
So neither of those are America

1574
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
No

1575
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,536
So

1576
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:20,352
Yeah I didn't get better and Coronavirus

1577
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,448
There is zero evidence that he bet against

1578
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,472
America

1579
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,544
In this case then Alex Jones

1580
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,312
Is

1581
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,616
Saying that the entire stock market

1582
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,664
Is representative of America

1583
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:38,528
Using this logic against these Dutch

1584
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,368
Is betting against America memes

1585
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
That you just if you bet against anything

1586
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,696
You're betting against me

1587
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,488
Lyrics

1588
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,512
Market

1589
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,048
Is the American mark

1590
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,888
It no to all except

1591
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,704
Do all

1592
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
Certain

1593
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,008
Now we come back to this question

1594
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
Is Alex

1595
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,336
Unaware of these bags

1596
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
Or is he willfully lying

1597
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,408
I think he's willfully lie

1598
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,224
This is this

1599
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,248
What is the thing that

1600
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,576
He has to be willful I willfully lying

1601
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,368
Did he tell you

1602
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,928
Oh man I wish I remembered

1603
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,512
If you knew that I would immediately jump so I'm going to have to

1604
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,816
Much better attention.

1605
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,144
Biomat

1606
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,704
That is the ultimate seller of this argument

1607
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,776
Between the two of us is going to turn it around

1608
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:36,128
So yeah I do not want to be

1609
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,200
Edward Norton

1610
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:44,576
I'm super excited that I can start to see on Twitter a lot of people calling out this Jewish

1611
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:47,904
Cunard is Jewish Boogeyman narrative about Sora

1612
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,184
I'm excited because

1613
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,464
Is it is really important

1614
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,768
First of all the idea that

1615
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,096
Soros paid protesters diminishes the idea

1616
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,888
Yep which is really bad

1617
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,240
Implications of it

1618
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,520
Really really

1619
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,312
Well I mean

1620
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,592
Echoes echoes

1621
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
All

1622
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,640
Goes all the way

1623
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,968
It goes all the way is wrong all the ways

1624
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,672
It's wrong all the way

1625
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,952
Absolutely

1626
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,256
All right we got to get now

1627
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,376
We are

1628
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,704
Extra-long episode

1629
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,264
We are abstract cover

1630
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,336
So it is now the 27

1631
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,360
Aldi's

1632
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
The eclipse will be from

1633
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,664
January 20th

1634
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,992
Friday move to the other last day of June

1635
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:48,832
There's a Friday was good didn't use the egg

1636
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,464
F*** around and got a triple double

1637
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,280
I want to start this adventure on the

1638
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,816
Seventh with

1639
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,864
Where we will agree

1640
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
With Alex

1641
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:05,728
A little bit because my favorites is whatever we have

1642
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,008
Give It Up to Alex Young

1643
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,080
And then he says the next thing ever like

1644
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
You just

1645
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,432
Spoke prophecy

1646
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,248
Is

1647
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,808
It's going to be a rollercoaster because

1648
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,368
Some real s***

1649
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,976
To do with Trump's stance on torture

1650
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,304
He said some real s*** and then it breaks so bad

1651
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,096
Okay here we go

1652
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,168
I think it could end up being our downfall

1653
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,704
If he's openly

1654
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,032
Orchards okay

1655
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,360
I forgot I cut out the first 3 minutes

1656
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,688
The first three minutes

1657
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,528
I agree with him on everything but torture

1658
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,808
It's a sticking point

1659
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,392
Because if you torture then you become the thing you're again

1660
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,952
And that's a really good point that's a really good

1661
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:58,976
But

1662
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,024
You like

1663
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,888
So here here is where exit

1664
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,984
I cut out all the part that I we actually agree with

1665
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:20,736
His principle is that he's Against torture which I think is great but but this is where he explained

1666
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,784
Picture

1667
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,576
He's against it

1668
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
Cuz you don't want

1669
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,368
Telluride

1670
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,952
That's a good guess it's actually worse

1671
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
Alright

1672
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:34,816
It could end up being our downfall

1673
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,056
The people running things

1674
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:48,896
We'll use that to Trump

1675
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,200
I think he's walking

1676
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,272
You can't frame somebody with real

1677
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,232
Saying what a thing

1678
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:09,888
Reporting

1679
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,008
One little girl

1680
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
That was not

1681
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,592
Framingham for blowing up that little girl

1682
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,872
He did that s***

1683
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:23,200
Yeah speaking with you read about that

1684
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:28,064
Brother of the little girl that Obamacare

1685
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,720
Everything that could go wrong went wrong almost everything was

1686
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,024
I love the world

1687
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:44,448
Thank God we got a guy who cuts through the b******* in charge

1688
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,984
Yeah give him a

1689
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,800
Isn't it depressing though.

1690
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,336
He's like I'm against

1691
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
Torture

1692
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,664
But then his reasoning for is

1693
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,968
Not that it's inhuman

1694
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,528
It's a horrible thing to do to people

1695
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,320
It degrades you as a person

1696
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,344
His

1697
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,136
His argument is

1698
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,672
You can use that against

1699
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,208
Yeah

1700
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,792
That's so that's a large glass box

1701
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,888
Is it more it is the motivation more important than the

1702
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
Cuz I'm all for him

1703
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,568
John Stuart Mill shed his

1704
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,152
The only thing that is good is Goodwill

1705
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,688
I see I'm going to go with us

1706
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,968
Long if he's against

1707
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:28,736
Torture

1708
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,552
Let's forget about it

1709
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:38,464
You might walk that back in a second what's

1710
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,304
Finish the quote

1711
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,376
President

1712
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:49,984
Disavow it look

1713
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:55,360
Do not codify something

1714
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:02,784
Emergency situation

1715
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:20,448
Isn't that an amazing way to end the argument

1716
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:26,336
Invalidates literally everything you just said

1717
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:31,200
Are you saying you're holding someone

1718
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,064
You know you're not actually going to turn me over because I can identify you

1719
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,600
Yep

1720
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,928
That's exactly what it is

1721
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,464
So close

1722
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,232
So close

1723
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,792
To being like, every single time

1724
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,352
Biggest

1725
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:52,448
Did the only reason you would kill someone after you torture them is because they can

1726
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,496
Talk about how you torture them

1727
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:58,080
Should be held accountable for

1728
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,616
Kill everyone

1729
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,176
Dip

1730
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,712
He just advocated

1731
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,736
Torturing

1732
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,160
Not just tortured side of torture is that some people might find out your torture

1733
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,792
A consequence base as opposed to like that's a principle that we should not do that

1734
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,840
Even then

1735
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:24,704
Assassinate

1736
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,752
Make them afterwards so then

1737
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,056
The torture is not going to go down

1738
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,872
Murders are going to go up

1739
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
So bad

1740
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,016
This is why

1741
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,600
Just going to be me barking

1742
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
Just do it

1743
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,232
Also indicate

1744
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,352
So clear that I don't think he knows what he's saying

1745
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,400
Any

1746
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
He's just talking

1747
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,448
Annie

1748
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,984
Concept

1749
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,056
Okay one this also supports

1750
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,336
He's living in a movie

1751
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,872
Episode of 24

1752
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,664
Yeah

1753
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,944
He's not living in Rio

1754
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,504
But I heard from General

1755
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,784
Who are on Fox

1756
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Fox

1757
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
Dramas

1758
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,416
Work

1759
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,048
If you are going

1760
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
If you are going to

1761
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,376
Anyway

1762
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,656
Count yourself

1763
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:27,936
A religious

1764
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,496
Cuz he believes in it

1765
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,776
Read everything

1766
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
You can

1767
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,384
Sibley say what

1768
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,176
You can't do it

1769
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,736
You literally

1770
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,504
Cannot do it

1771
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Nope

1772
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,552
If

1773
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,112
If you torture then you must kill

1774
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,136
Yeah that's

1775
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,208
No that's analyzation

1776
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:54,304
Chesebro actually that might be

1777
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,608
Earlier that we get

1778
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:03,008
To talk about the illegal voting claims

1779
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:10,432
I mean probably only a week away from that publishing

1780
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Weekly

1781
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,736
Reports on

1782
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
Big time

1783
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,600
We're going to die

1784
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,184
So I hear is

1785
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,768
Found more studies

1786
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,048
The pru

1787
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,328
The Trump is correct

1788
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Trump

1789
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,800
Saturday

1790
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,360
Provides alternative facts

1791
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,408
Alternative facts like

1792
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,456
University study

1793
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:46,784
University George Mason University

1794
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,368
Concluding upwards of 2.8 million illegals

1795
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,904
Voted and Swan

1796
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,184
Key election

1797
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,488
2014

1798
01:34:56,768 --> 01:35:02,144
And then today and said they found

1799
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,192
800000

1800
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,288
This study

1801
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,336
Unfortunately

1802
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,616
He studies at all

1803
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
What are you doing

1804
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,688
I am looking at that exact

1805
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
What was

1806
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:22,112
Here's what's fun if you just Google The Old Dominion study

1807
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,648
The first thing that comes up

1808
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,928
Is

1809
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
A story

1810
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,256
Where the headline is

1811
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,048
Stop speeding

1812
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,656
Virginia professor says Trump twisting his research on non-citizen voting

1813
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:41,824
So we have this guy who tweeted about the illegal voting

1814
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,128
About is himself registered to vote in three

1815
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:47,712
Old Dominion study where this guy who wrote

1816
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:50,272
The study says stop using it you're twisting the facts

1817
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,808
We have a Pew research

1818
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,624
About illegal voting where the guy who's consist

1819
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,160
Gone on record and said

1820
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,720
They're not saying what my study shows

1821
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah

1822
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
Now there's the George Washington

1823
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
So I can't speak to that

1824
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,448
But a little bit further research

1825
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,984
Into the Old Dominion

1826
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:10,752
Study

1827
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:11,776
I want to think

1828
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,544
Found

1829
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,104
Was that I'll just always read this offer bait

1830
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,664
A recent study by political science

1831
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,456
Old Dominion University

1832
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,736
The use the 2008

1833
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,552
2010 Cooperative congressional election study

1834
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,344
To examine whether quote

1835
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,624
Boden USA

1836
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,696
The authors reported about 1% of the

1837
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,464
Responded

1838
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,488
Survey identified

1839
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,512
Themselves as nonsense

1840
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,280
An immigrant

2010

1845
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,680
Estimating the

1846
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,984
21 of these self-identified nonsense

1847
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Justin's voted in

1848
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
In 2000

1849
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
An eighth

1850
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,080
Self-identified nonsense

1851
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,104
Voted

1852
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,152
They use this to

1853
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,688
Project National voting rate

1854
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,968

Jesse Richman

1858

And David Ortiz to authors

1859
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,672
Admitted that they are quote

1860
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,440
Extrapolation

1861
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,768
State-level or district-level election outcome is

1862
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,536
Rock With You

1863
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,816
Substantial uncertain

1864
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,888
The authors noted that

1865
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,448
It's a non-citizen

1866
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
Can create errors

1867
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,592
They're self-reporting

1868
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,896
Was imperfect and supplemented by a

1869
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,176
The

1870
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,224
The ultimate estimate this is

1871
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,248
This is how bad this

1872
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
Study is

1873
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:29,600
Haha be as low as 38,000

1874
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,880
And as high as

1875
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,160
2.81

1876
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,208
Which is any POTUS

1877
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,768
Single worst

1878
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,792
Study

1879
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:41,120
Okay if your margin of error is 1%

1880
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:41,888
That's okay

1881
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,216
1

1882
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,752
Thousand percent

1883
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,568
It's crazy bad margin

1884
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,128
Well and whenever your studies are based on like

1885
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,432
Unverifiable self-reported back

1886
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:59,040
It's a it's a they took a poll of a small amount of people who said they were

1887
01:37:59,296 --> 01:37:59,808
Unread

1888
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,832
Just aired when they voted

1889
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,136
And another one in 2008

1890
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,952
Another one of these studies that they cited was based

1891
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,512
Self

1892
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,328
What is a self-directed internet

1893
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
Studies

1894
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,632
Which is basically like

Stuff like that

You can do transcription work on it

1904
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:35,648
It's little things that can't be automated by robots

1905
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:39,232
To do like a little bit

1906
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,280
The little password things

1907
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:48,704
Use that to translate things for a little while when I was unemployed

1908
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,776
I'm trying to get a little bit extra money trying to go

1909
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:56,128
Who have dabbled in it there's a bunch of university studies

1910
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,736
The people who are filling those out or getting paid 25

1911
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,016
To do it and no they need

1912
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
Need to fill out like

1913
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,576
Papparoti

1914
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,696
So no no no no no

1915
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:15,072
Protesters

1916
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,120
In order to make a living

1917
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,400
Back on board

1918
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,960
When you fill out surveys

1919
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,240
For money

1920
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
You're trying to grind through the

1921
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,848
So you often give an accurate information

1922
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,712
Any you have a monetary

1923
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,504
Incentive

1924
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,040
Just f****** foot

1925
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,832
That's like being paid

1926
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:41,696
To take standardized tests as fast as you can so you just write see you in every single one of

1927
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,488
Any study that has

1928
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,024
Part of their sample Bay

1929
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,840
Online opt-in studies

1930
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,888
Is generally considered the

1931
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,912
Bastard child

1932
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:54,240
Avant during most

1933
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,520
Fox News polls

1934
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,592
They have somehow 81% support

1935
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,616
Insane thing

1936
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:07,040
97%

1937
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,576
Of the popular vote

1938
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,112
Statistics

1939
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:13,184
Or only as trustworthy as a methodology used to

1940
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
Yes and

1941
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,024
You can say whatever you want

1942
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,584
And if you look which is the

1943
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,608
Single most

1944
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,632
Frustrating

1945
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,192
Part of having a conversation but sound

1946
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,752
This

1947
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,824
Is backed up by this and they're like oh yeah

1948
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
Is backed up

1949
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
By this

1950
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,344
Is that isn't play

1951
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,392
Because we had liar love and

1952
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:46,464
I'm trying to work it out

1953
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,536
That is a factor issue

1954
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,840
Beyond that

1955
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,888
You also have the people who wrote the

1956
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
The studies being like

1957
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,216
You are misrepresenting

1958
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
What we're saying

1959
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:02,592
That is not what we're saying 3 million a lotus

1960
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,408
Yeah the study is so poorly made

1961
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,224
It it one is not rap

1962
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,760
Hookah Bowl

1963
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,064
Any study that has an estimate

1964
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,624
Between 38000 and 2.81 million

1965
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,672
Is impossible to replicate

1966
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,744
It's also the most easy thing to rap

1967
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
Okay and that you grab

1968
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,816
Kissimmee

1969
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:25,632
The street and go probably like

1970
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:32,800
According to all 10 employees at Five Guys

1971
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,360
There are too many employees at Five Guys

1972
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
Luann Alex's other argument

1973
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,224
Is

1974
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,272
This salon.com

1975
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,552
Politico

1976
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
Article

1977
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,368
The headline of it

1978
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,648
Illegal immigrant

1979
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,928
Could elect Hillary

1980
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
October 3rd

1981
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,000
2015

1982
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,536
It is a real article

1983
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,584
But what it deals with

1984
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,352
Is

1985
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,888
The apportionment

1986
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,168
How how bad

1987
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:05,312
We're all going to f****** die

1988
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,104
We are

1989
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,152
About how

1990
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,968
Electoral votes

1991
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,992
House of Representatives

1992
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,808
And basically those work off the census

1993
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:19,648
Doesn't care if you're illegal or legal

1994
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,952
It's just about the number of

1995
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,232
Yeah that lives somewhere

1996
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,840
Take on it and I will compare that with Alex

1997
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,728
I'll start with the fun

1998
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,032
Who take is but this is nonsense

1999
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,848
And who gives a f*** about these illegal

2000
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:41,152
You shouldn't matter for the population numbers

2001
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:43,456
Are they shouldn't be represented by this thing

2002
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,016
And the fact that they're considered in the census

2003
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:48,064
Which gives more House of Representatives

2004
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,112
Representation

2005
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,648
And more

2006
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,416
Meme

2007
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,720
The California and New York are cheating

2008
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,744
Just by default

2009
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,768
So Trump is right

2010
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,304
My argument

2011
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,072
Is

2012
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,632
That illegal or legal

2013
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:02,912
These are people

2014
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,448
Disagree

2015
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,008
There's no such thing as people

2016
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,824
Whether or not

2017
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
They

2018
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,384
Came here legally or not

2019
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,944
The representatives are

2020
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,224
Yeah

2021
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,272
The hookah spot

2022
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,576
That's just kind of my point

2023
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:27,232
New York is not as filled with Ali

2024
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,256
Illegal immigrants

2025
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,536
Tons of Indians

2026
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,304
Yeah

2027
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,376
Understand

2028
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,424
California

2029
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,216
I would say yes

2030
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,496
Is filled with illegal immigrants

2031
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:41,312
Maybe that's because

2032
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,848
The people there are nicer

2033
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:49,504
I'm actually you also have Arizona you have those other states

2034
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,808
Which are firmly in the Trump balls

2035
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,648
Yeah they are licking as much Trump balls is a fossa

2036
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
Turn right now

2037
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
New York

2038
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,232
Illegal immigrants are not going to

2039
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,512
To turn New York from

2040
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,072
Narrative

2041
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,096
I know but it's

2042
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,120
Simply not pot

2043
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:09,984
You're not going to turn Illinois from Blue to Red mainly because Chicago

2044
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,776
Is all of Illinois

2045
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:15,360
Yeah I mean

2046
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:21,760
Illinois where you living anywhere other than Chicago other than you group

2047
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:26,112
There's like DeKalb there's a couple of cities with temporary huge populations

2048
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
For the college

2049
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,160
Yeah but that

2050
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
But that doesn't matter

2051
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,744
No not for illegal immigrants

2052
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,768
So anyway

2053
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:36,608
This whole thing is built on lies

2054
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,632
Just

2055
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,424
House of Cards

2056
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,568
Studies that their own writers have said is not

2057
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,104
Ears

2058
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,456
Easiest argument against 3 million illegal immigrants

2059
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,016
In terms of voting population

2060
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,064
We had 100 million people

2061
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,088
Roughly

2062
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,416
50% of

2063
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,952
The total amount of people who could be

2064
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:05,792
Write your three million illegal immigrants voting

2065
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:09,120
Is what 3% of the population that votes

2066
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,728
You wouldn't know any legal immigrants vote

2067
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:17,568
Well I was like okay so

2068
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,640
You would have seen it illegally

2069
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:27,040
Group

2070
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,112
25 people

2071
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:35,232
There's a 50-50 shot you stare that you share the same birthday as somebody else

2072
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,256
House to testics

2073
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:40,608
If you're talking about 3% of the entire population voting

2074
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
That voted

2075
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,912
You would have gone to

2076
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,448
There's a

2077
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:47,520
What there's a wigwam

2078
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:53,920
Kind of illegal immigrants who is actually turning around and saying like

2079
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,200
I'm not supposed to do this

2080
01:45:55,456 --> 01:46:01,600
Like that's what would have happened we were stranded, how about this this single person who was it

2081
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,904
No and the guy from the Pew research

2082
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,976
Study I was talking about how the numbers that he

2083
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,048
Of people who claimed

2084
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,584
To be illegal immigrants

2085
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,632
And voting

2086
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,168
He went back

2087
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,960
Looked into those people

2088
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:20,544
And almost every single one of them was an error

2089
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,872
Well there's been what like

2090
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,920
10 cases of voter fraud in the past

2091
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:31,040
50 years or what

2092
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:36,160
Yeah voting multiple times

2093
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:39,488
Like we said the guy who tweeted about it is ready

2094
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,512
3 States

2095
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,560
Steve mnuchin

2096
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:48,960
It makes funny Trump Kushner they're all registered in multiple States

2097
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
So like

2098
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,288
Doing

2099
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:54,080
It makes intuitive sense

2100
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:56,640
Swear you're like oh everybody has an idea

2101
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:58,688
For the for the white shirt

2102
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,224
For the rich white bass

2103
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:04,832
They live with everybody has an idea if that's

2104
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:10,720
How can you drive without an ID exactly like

2105
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,512
Or you have to have a driver's license

2106
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,816
Instead of just a state ID

2107
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,864
Or whatever it is or I'm lost

2108
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,400
My ID

2109
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,960
Too costly to go get another one

2110
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,240
I mean looking busy

2111
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,008
Yeah

2112
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,288
So-so

2113
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,336
Is it does make a certain into

2114
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,128
Until you read up on

2115
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,664
Which is

2116
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,504
That's why you're asking people a lot

2117
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,064
You're asking a lot of the human race

2118
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,112
Or if you have Bass

2119
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:38,880
Human empathy

2120
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:45,792
I don't like it when you say it like that cuz that meet some crazy around the corner

2121
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,864
We've poked holes and

2122
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,144
Discuss the feud

2123
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,472
Narrative heavy stuff a couple a couple of issues

2124
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,752
Vitalik

2125
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:58,848
I don't I don't know if we can come to a resolution on this

2126
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,128
Because I

2127
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,176
A hundred percent believe he's willfully lie

2128
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:03,968
You think

2129
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,504
Possible

2130
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:10,624
Bi still here's my ears my argument

2131
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,160
It's the basic lighted

2132
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
You cannot

2133
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
Tell somebody is

2134
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,024
If they

2135
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,328
100% believe the lie there

2136
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,352
Their tally

2137
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,400
That's

2138
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
It is a lie

2139
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,496
I'm just saying that if you believe it

2140
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,360
Alex

2141
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:39,552
There's no way he would submit to that but also

2142
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:41,856
He is on Joe Rogan

2143
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,416
And I think that will be the catalyst

2144
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,952
Are we

2145
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,232
We might have to

2146
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:49,536
Could go really bad

2147
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:54,912
I'm really wanting to go really really worried The Joe Rogan will show his cards

2148
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,520
Conspiracy theorist

2149
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,544
He

2150
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,824
Is into some

2151
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,848
Conspiracy theorist

2152
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,384
He's great on Newsradio

2153
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:09,248
He also has a pretty good head on his shoulders and Beverly

2154
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:10,784
And we all know how that turned out

2155
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,344
It wasn't good on you

2156
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,440
We will

2157
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,536
Newsradio

2158
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:28,192
Newsradio

2159
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:32,800
What are the shows not much to cover

2160
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:35,360
Logan

2161
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:37,664
Conspiracy stuff but he generally is pretty good about the

2162
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Debunking things

2163
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:44,320
Yet he's generally very skeptical and whenever I'm very worried that Alex is going to go on there and he's not going to call him out on

2164
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:47,648
Because if he does Alex will just start yelling at

2165
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:50,208
There's no point in having that as a show

2166
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:50,976
Like

2167
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:56,096
Joe has had Milo yiannopoulos on a couple times

2168
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,656
To be fair Joe doesn't like

2169
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,936
Side with him

2170
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:01,216
But he sort of laughs

2171
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,776
Milos

2172
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,848
Going full Jimmy Fallon on

2173
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,896
A little bit

2174
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,736
If we get to the point where we can just

2175
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,296
That's right

2176
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,832
Point where Joe

2177
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,600
Brings

2178
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:20,160
The most negative tweets

2179
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,840
You got it

2180
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:28,864
Jimmy Fallon

2181
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:29,888
Control arm

2182
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:35,520
The caveat we have is that the routes are amazing and Quest love is the greatest

2183
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,592
Is the routes were amazed

2184
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,360
Anyway

2185
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:42,688
Next

2186
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:48,064
Affair conversation

2187
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,856
Let me get to my f****** point

2188
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,464
So

2189
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,000
Totally worried

2190
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:58,304
That Alex is going to go on Joe Rogan

2191
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,072
Podcast

2192
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,376
He's not going to get called out on his

2193
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,680
Absolute propagandizing

2194
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:05,472
His absolutely

2195
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,496
Twisting of facts

2196
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:09,056
And he's going to be endeared

2197
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,080
To Joe Rogan

2198
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,128
Which will expand

2199
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,432
The group of people that will be opened

2200
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
Infowars

2201
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,736
That scares the s*** out

2202
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,856
Him getting White House credentials and being part of the press

2203
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,768
Jerome corsi

2204
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,048
He was talking about how he

2205
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:32,352
He's in the process of giving the credentials anything's

2206
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,376
It's going to be no problem

2207
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,424
I don't know if that's true

2208
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,472
It's probably true true

2209
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
I don't think

2210
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,032
It's not true

2211
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,056
I don't think it's not

2212
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,872
But to be in a position

2213
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:46,176
We're Alex and Infowars as a whole

2214
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,200
Take Auto

2215
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,736
Way bigger part of

2216
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:49,504
Depress

2217
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,528
Then we won

2218
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,320
Not do what you want

2219
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:55,136
Do you mean any part of the body public

2220
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,416
Should not want the

2221
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,488
He is a propaganda

2222
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,768
It terrified

2223
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,352
Anyway we need that

2224
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:11,520
It's like gerbils had a radio show with a small amount of listeners and then all the sudden

2225
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,568
Hitler was like

2226
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,336
Hey man

2227
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,200
Bring it up girls became amazing

2228
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:29,952
No rhythm John Griffin could still riff better than Alex show

2229
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,744
The greatest

2230
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,632
Some fun

2231
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:40,192
On the 27th

2232
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,216
Most

2233
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,240
Of the show

2234
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:43,776
Call boys

2235
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,312
About how pissed off

2236
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,848
Alex's at Sienna

2237
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:51,968
Dmsm the mainstream media

2238
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:55,296
BNN cuz they did a story about him

2239
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:05,536
So earlier that if it was a puff piece he would be mad that they were mad at him about the wrong thing and that clip

2240
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,328
Played a little bit earlier he was like

2241
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,120
He said the line

2242
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,656
Wow

2243
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,424
The journalist

2244
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,960
Fact check Trump

2245
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:15,264
Provides alternative

2246
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,824
That is the beginning of this

2247
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,104
Introduction

2248
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,408
Clip from CNN

2249
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,432
About him

2250
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,200
Okay

2251
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,480
Now hold on

2252
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
Cheater f****** hat

2253
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:31,904
I have a warning for Jurassic we are

2254
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
Hold on

2255
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,720
Because hold on

2256
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,512
Never gets

2257
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,560
Do the part about him

2258
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,656
Does he okay

2259
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:45,984
Here's my favorite running thing he does

2260
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,264
Let's get this bread

2261
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:52,640
That's my favorite

2262
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,944
Horse competition with

2263
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:03,392
He does he does he do that

2264
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:04,928
I can't remember

2265
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,744
Excited to find out I wouldn't short it

2266
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,048
That's what I would say

2267
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,840
I wouldn't

2268
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,680
So this first clip is just about us a pack of liars

2269
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,472
And we'll get into the fun

2270
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,264
Visit 3 clips long

2271
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,544
But man

2272
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,528
Mursi's government

2273
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:33,600
Their numbers are Warrior

2274
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:36,672
This is back to the voters

2275
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,952
Do research

2276
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:38,976
Pure research

2277
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:45,888
Pew pew

2278
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:47,680
So I wasn't sure which one

2279
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:53,568
Voter fraud that narrative

2280
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,896
Organizing

2281
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:05,088
I got caught all that is not true

2282
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:09,440
Which state

2283
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:15,840
Preposterous 6 months ago

2284
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:16,864
Know what that means

2285
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,632
Dizon

2286
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:23,520
Well they are federal but they run on the state level

2287
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
Like eat

2288
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:30,944
State sort of independently-run there elections that's why

2289
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:32,992
Difference

2290
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:36,320
Alex

2291
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:42,720
Primaries believes executive order to put up by Obama

2292
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:47,840
The election under the auspices of the federal government

2293
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,888
It's not

2294
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:53,216
Hillary VP

2295
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,776
She would think that

2296
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,312
But it don't matter

2297
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:00,384
Well yeah you're right you're right

2298
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,224
All of all of the what-ifs after something that didn't happen

2299
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,016
Are just fantasy

2300
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,112
I will do the milly studies logic

2301
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:11,392
Voldemort had one

2302
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,416
Yeah

2303
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:15,488
Logic in college

2304
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:19,584
Understand about logic

2305
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,120
It isn't

2306
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,424
Logic is

2307
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,448
Central Lee

2308
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,240
A method of

2309
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,264
Truth preservation

2310
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,544
That's all it is

2311
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,592
So basically when you have an if-then

2312
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:31,616
Statement

2313
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:32,384
If the

2314
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,920
First part is true

2315
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:34,944
The second forecast

2316
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:37,504
If the first part isn't true

2317
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,344
It doesn't matter with the second part so if you're saying

2318
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:45,440
Obama federalized the elections and therefore we are where we are

2319
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:51,072
It doesn't matter what you talk about

2320
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:55,424
Is that it presupposes that human beings are rational which we all know

2321
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,752
If then

2322
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:01,056
Often winds up being an issue because

2323
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,080
Do you get

2324
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:04,640
If a then would you prefer

2325
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,408
And people say

2326
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,464
Human rationality

2327
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,232
I'm with you

2328
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:21,536
Let's get back to this dump

2329
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:25,632
Which Obama's now done and all 50 State Attorney General

2330
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:30,752
Including Democrats

2331
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:33,312
I did some

2332
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,848
Some deep digging on this one found

2333
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:37,152
Mayweather

2334
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:44,064
I can't even find evidence history of the human race

2335
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,856
I literally can't even find evidence

2336
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:48,160
Any attorney-general's writing about this

2337
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:53,280
Which is a pronoun

2338
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:00,704
Knock knock

2339
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:06,592
You're right you're wrong we tell the truth if you lie your honorable your dishonorable

2340
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:22,976
Alright

2341
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,000
Alright alright

2342
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,792
Rhythm

2343
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,840
Yeah that back and forth

2344
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:31,424
Perfect rhythm

2345
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,960
Yeah

2346
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:35,008
He's good at like that sort of hypnotic

2347
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,032
Sort of

2348
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,080
A business

2349
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,064
Now I just wanted to WhatsApp

2350
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,856
Super exciting

2351
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,648
Super effective

2352
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:55,744
When you're literally lying and you choose other people being like

2353
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:00,096
Just wait we always go back to

2354
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:00,864
That

2355
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:01,888
The big

2356
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,656
Through-line

2357
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:03,936
Entire body

2358
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,472
Is

2359
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:06,752
They're doing

2360
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
What they say

2361
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,056
We're doing

2362
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:12,384
Which is such a signal that we're doing

2363
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,920
Exactly what they

2364
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:14,688
They say we're doing

2365
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,224
Please don't look at what I'm doing

2366
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,760
They're doing

2367
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:26,720
One of the branches of Journalism

2368
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,000
Media criticism

2369
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:29,792
And it's a very legitimate

2370
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:30,560
Branch

2371
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:32,608
Important

2372
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:33,376
Absolutely

2373
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:34,912
Now

2374
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:35,936
In this clip

2375
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,472
Alex

2376
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:38,752
Attempt

2377
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,800
To do some media criticism

2378
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:44,128
Honesty

2379
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,688
I want to say this

2380
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:48,992
Play all of it cuz it

2381
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,016
Really loses

2382
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,576
At some point

2383
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,600
But this clip

2384
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:55,904
Legitimately is like six

2385
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,928
16 minutes long

2386
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,256
So this is me

2387
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,304
Before the show

2388
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:05,120
He said we were going to do the laundry slip

2389
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,960
Alex Alex

2390
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:14,336
I'm doing and if we're going to get into The Shakespearean play that is

2391
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:16,896
Alex Joe Zack Morris off

2392
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:18,432
Yes you're going to do a freeze frame

2393
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:20,992
He did it for Easter

2394
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,016
Ladies jealous

2395
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,064
Do we have

2396
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:28,672
I was going to drop in freeze frame by Jay geils

2397
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:36,608
We got to finish this

2398
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,704
Yeah he told me about this earlier any

2399
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,496
Tease the longest

2400
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,776
I was like

2401
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,800
5 minutes

2402
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:46,848
Turns out it's

2403
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:47,872
16

2404
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:51,968
Minutes that's a long-ass clip

2405
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:54,016
45% of the episode we've done

2406
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:54,784
So far

2407
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,808
I have no,

2408
02:00:56,576 --> 02:01:00,160
He's criticizing a clip from CNN

2409
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:03,744
I'll just get into it because I don't think I can do it justice

2410
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:21,152
Reliable sources are reliable at like a white truck pulls up

2411
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:23,456
At the playground

2412
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,992
We have puppies

2413
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,784
We have comic books

2414
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,576
That's equivalent in a

2415
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:32,672
Look there's a puppy pipe

2416
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:35,488
So, everybody's a pedophile

2417
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:44,960
So f****** just immediately go the show is called reliable

2418
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:47,776
This club

2419
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:52,896
But also I want I want to play it I want to play this like

2420
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:56,480
A little longer

2421
02:01:56,736 --> 02:02:02,368
It's going to get mad if we keep interrupting clips

2422
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:05,952
It's spectacular

2423
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:08,256
Can't let this play

2424
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,072
Like legitimately

2425
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:16,192
Goes on terrible wrist and hand

2426
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:22,848
Is that

2427
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:25,152
Microphone

2428
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:27,712
Inside of the truck

2429
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:31,040
Oh hi come on in the back of the truck

2430
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:34,880
Come on America, enslave you

2431
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:36,672
Control you look at this guy

2432
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:43,328
Guy look like he's a chump

2433
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,888
Funny acts like a big fat

2434
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
Trump

2435
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:52,544
Iran

2436
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:54,848
Creeper van

2437
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:58,688
Unreliable

2438
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:07,392
So also I should say this cuz I was watching this cuz I was like this is so bananas I got to see the video

2439
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,536
What the guy in the booth.

2440
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:16,352
This point is puts up like

2441
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:17,376
Image

2442
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,912
Of a white van

2443
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:23,008
It says free candy on the side and a bunch of bloody hand

2444
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:31,456
Pedophile

2445
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:34,016
Leave the bloody handprints on there

2446
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:35,040
How did you have that ready

2447
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:44,256
One of those Mexico

2448
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:05,760
Kneerover

2449
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,552
I just pumped the dog look

2450
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:20,864
.

2451
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:32,128
Million-dollar

2452
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:56,448
Wait what

2453
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,984
I guess so

2454
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:02,848
Mocking this guy for swallowing a word

2455
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:09,248
Alex said earlier when he was saying Infowars

2456
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,344
Doesn't matter

2457
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:14,368
Doesn't matter

2458
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,184
The real point of this clip is

2459
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:18,976
He has let

2460
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,256
Jake Tapper say

2461
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:21,536
6 words

2462
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,072
This isn't Jake Tapper

2463
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:27,424
This is just some young guy Brian stelter

2464
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:32,032
I don't know who he is he's a doesn't look like he's very seasoned

2465
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:34,592
But he's he's definitely not ready to take

2466
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,640
Nobody

2467
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:38,688
He just doesn't have our raw power

2468
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,480
What's up

2469
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:46,880
My mommy look at me on TV for the Big Barn Chinese government

2470
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:56,096
Brian

2471
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:07,104
Shut up

2472
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:17,856
He went back into the Transformers voice

2473
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,624
You did

2474
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:31,424
Mr stilted on.cnn her death

2475
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:38,080
Maybe you'd YouTube

2476
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,200
What's there

2477
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,296
With that stopping there is

2478
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:52,672
Was maybe you have issues with Trump

2479
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:55,488
I have issues Trump maybe you do too

2480
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,792
That's not what you said at all which will

2481
02:06:58,048 --> 02:06:59,584
Find out what he plays the clip back

2482
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:05,984
Again here in a little bit cuz I'm going to play

2483
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:08,544
Quick question

2484
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,872
Here's my bet

2485
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,408
Yeah this is not a question

2486
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,736
Maxwell

2487
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:19,296
How many minutes before he gets

2488
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,320
45 seconds

2489
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:21,856
I don't think he ever

2490
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:27,232
But I'm going to give him I'm going to give him 7

2491
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:29,536
If we play this clip for 7 minutes

2492
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:31,328
I say he get through

2493
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,608
32nd

2494
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:33,632
Of what

2495
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:40,544
I really wish there was a way for us to like have stopwatches but see it's it's just

2496
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:41,568
Phone

2497
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,384
With stopwatches mine is playing

2498
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,688
Guess what mine's going to be doing

2499
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:47,712
Okay

2500
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:52,064
So what I need you guys to keep your ears open for is the way that he just

2501
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:54,112
Words out of context

2502
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,136
Response to that

2503
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:58,720
He's not responding to what this guy is actually saying

2504
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:03,072
He's responding to certain words that are said

2505
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:06,144
Just let the guy say his name and then it called

2506
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:12,800
We're not we're not even responding

2507
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:18,432
Million dollars

2508
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:23,296
Because Alex is really wrapped up in masculinity Twitter

2509
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:26,368
He might as well.

2510
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:27,136
Yeah

2511
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:30,208
So let me know when I need to start the

2512
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:31,488
I'm not going

2513
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,768
Pause this clip again

2514
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,792
Just going to play

2515
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:37,376
There will be laughing in the background

2516
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:38,400
I can't imagine

2517
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:39,424
Take notes

2518
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,448
Though because

2519
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,216
We're not stopping

2520
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,008
Okay I'll do my best

2521
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:46,848
Stopwatch

2522
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:05,280
On a daily basis

2523
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:09,376
Instagram.

2524
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,800
Holes where he was

2525
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:20,640
Possible

2526
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,624
For this point Alex

2527
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,392
Preening

2528
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,416
I'm trying to pretend to do a

2529
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,840
A bunch of

2530
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:55,456
I don't have question

2531
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:57,760
It's verifiably Ally

2532
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:04,160
Questions

2533
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:23,616
Grocery store

2534
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:39,744
Dominator

2535
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:49,472
Everybody says aren't you and your family

2536
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:05,088
Will President Trump

2537
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:12,000
What will the consequences be for the president

2538
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:19,424
Consequences

2539
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:33,248
We already know you're a fraud

2540
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,976
Dance

2541
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:47,840
I bet your family are a bunch of

2542
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:57,824
You look like a pair of Dishonor the trash

2543
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:15,232
So this is where I cut the clip because it goes on for another like

2544
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,512
2:10

2545
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,560
Let me see music

2546
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:20,608
Statistics

2547
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:21,376
19 sec

2548
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:23,936
You made it through

2549
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:26,496
Hey but that's also including running it back

2550
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:27,776
No

2551
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:31,616
Every time every time he rear-ended

2552
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:36,992
So the Betsy did was cutting it off

2553
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:44,928
And then he let it run again without restarting it for another 3 seconds

2554
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:49,536
Immediately after that he let it run again for another

2555
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:53,120
One point

2556
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:55,680
My favorite thing on there is his like

2557
02:12:56,448 --> 02:13:00,032
Brian stelter is being like is the idea of lying

2558
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:01,568
Coming up with all this b*******

2559
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:02,848
Is it to wear us out

2560
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,896
What do you mean

2561
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:05,664
Journalist

2562
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,944
The people trying to cover it

2563
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:07,968
Alex

2564
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:11,808
Take that personally

2565
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:15,904
But you just misinterpreting

2566
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:19,744
No not misinterpreting anything

2567
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:22,816
To misinterpret

2568
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:25,376
Fair enough he let the guy say his name

2569
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:29,728
And then he immediately rag on whether or not he could f***

2570
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:34,848
The single most beta-male thing that you could

2571
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,128
Possibly do

2572
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,432
Yeah

2573
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,968
Beta male is there

2574
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:43,808
Yeah that's their language

2575
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:47,648
Don't Go full cock if there's one lesson knowledge

2576
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,952
Don't go,

2577
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:53,536
It was immediately

2578
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:54,304
You can't

2579
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:03,264
You never have to you never have to engage never

2580
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:09,408
Your family or butter cookies

2581
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,688
Yeah

2582
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:13,248
Bridget surprise

2583
02:14:13,504 --> 02:14:14,016
To learn

2584
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:20,160
Could not imagine

2585
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:23,232
Him not being able to get through Clips cuz it gets

2586
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
Twomad

2587
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:27,072
Fake mad.

2588
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:30,400
It's not even

2589
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:31,680
He's just

2590
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:33,984
Manhood

2591
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:38,848
Bush-league bulshit distraction

2592
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,664
I honestly think that

2593
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,432
The content

2594
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,456
What he's doing is with

2595
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,296
I mean

2596
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,832
The reason of the interrupt

2597
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:50,112
Over and over

2598
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,136
Over again

2599
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,160
Does not allow any

2600
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:52,928
Contacts

2601
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,720
What you talkin about

2602
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:55,744
To be aired

2603
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,280
It's cuz he knows he has nothing

2604
02:14:58,048 --> 02:15:04,192
The woman who engaged him on the inauguration episode

2605
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:09,312
What what did he say

2606
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:14,688
And at the same thing you did earlier in this episode

2607
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:16,480
The story about

2608
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:22,880
Chinese you have no no no nothing to say so we just

2609
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:26,464
Insulted the way to avoid too much time to fill

2610
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:28,768
Handle Allen actual argumentative

2611
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:29,792
Pierce the space

2612
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:31,072
Ya gotta just

2613
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:33,120
Start yelling nonsense

2614
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,144
But what's

2615
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:36,448
Really depressing to me

2616
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:39,776
Maybe one of the reasons our show will never be us

2617
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:42,080
Successful it says is that

2618
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:48,992
That's really interesting

2619
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:53,344
They don't care if there's no substitute

2620
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,648
We're doing all right

2621
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:02,048
We would only make it through 19 seconds of his clips

2622
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:04,864
Another 10 minutes

2623
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,656
I think the total was likes

2624
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:07,424
16

2625
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:09,216
I'm trying to get

2626
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,008
Wow

2627
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:15,616
Listen to is roughly four

2628
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:18,176
Yeah so in 4 minutes he made it through

2629
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:22,784
19 total seconds 4 minutes after like

2630
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:29,440
Probably a minute we're looking at probably about 5 to 6 minutes

2631
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:30,720
Zeitgeist clip

2632
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,256
Throughout

2633
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,536
It was

2634
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:34,304
Cure

2635
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:35,584
Personal attack

2636
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:38,144
And nothing is gauging the

2637
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:42,240
There's nothing

2638
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:43,776
Never even got past

2639
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:46,336
Interdyne name is Brian

2640
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:51,456
Isaac goes on here

2641
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:52,992
Transition

2642
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:55,296
Look at this little p****

2643
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,064

Transitions at 8

2645
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:00,160
Stuff about how spicy

2646
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,184
Pretty cool

2647
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,000
8D

2648
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:06,560
Yeah you lose the thread entirely

2649
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:07,584
Here's the end of

2650
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,376
Which I think is

2651
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:18,080
Are just absolutely from him introducing himself

2652
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:26,528
Do we need to start this over for the beginning

2653
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:27,296
Wendy

2654
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:29,344
He says I'm done with the clip

2655
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:32,928
He might have made it through another 15-20 seconds

2656
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:35,744
O'Brien's pub

2657
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,536
Ballpark

2658
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:48,032
I can't listen to this

2659
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:51,616
I can't believe how much of a beta male disguise

2660
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,760
Absolutely despicable

2661
02:17:58,016 --> 02:17:59,808
Liars

2662
02:18:00,064 --> 02:18:02,112
Nobody is a Despicable liar

2663
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:06,976
But this guy right here family probably has sex with bear

2664
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:09,280
Have you ever seen a family have sex with bears

2665
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,048
I have

2666
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:12,352
It's disconcerting to say the least

2667
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:18,752
Pizza place right now I can't even listen to anymore

2668
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:28,736
Liars

2669
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:37,440
Puzzle people are horrible

2670
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:41,792
People that would do anything

2671
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:43,840
These are your family

2672
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:47,168
I want to make you poop

2673
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:58,688
Real quick

2674
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:01,248
The media are your enemy

2675
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:03,296
For your family

2676
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:04,576
How is that

2677
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:07,136
There's no

2678
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,184
Possible way that you can listen to

2679
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,976
If not

2680
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:12,000
And not

2681
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:15,072
And not immediately think

2682
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,400
Isn't that

2683
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,168
Complete

2684
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:19,936
Checklist

2685
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:21,728
All the words you just said

2686
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,264
Somewhat

2687
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,032
Like

2688
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:28,896
While he's giving you a checklist of what it is they're doing

2689
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,944
He's immediately following it up

2690
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,224
With doing that

2691
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:37,088
But you can remember

2692
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:42,464
This comes back to exactly we talked about the other day like one of the last episodes

2693
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:44,000
We talked about you were wondering

2694
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:45,024
If he's evil

2695
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:45,792
Stupid

2696
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:48,864
Evil or standby argument

2697
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,912
He's evil and he relies on other

2698
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:54,752
Stupidity he is he knows that other people aren't going to

2699
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,104
Get the sources

2700
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,384
But he's actual site

2701
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:01,152
There is

2702
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:06,528
Winning the war of the second

2703
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:08,576
This idea that

2704
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:09,600
Dim media

2705
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:11,904
These are your family's enemies

2706
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:15,744
Is one of the most repugnant things I've ever heard in my f****** life

2707
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:22,144
Let's start the clipart

2708
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:25,216
Flyers

2709
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,664
Terrible

2710
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,712
People that would do anything

2711
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:40,064
These are your family's enemies

2712
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:43,392
I want to make you poor

2713
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:49,792
For you it's there are better than people and they get off on Obamacare

2714
02:20:57,728 --> 02:20:58,752
Bill still

2715
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:02,080
But Humanity standing up

2716
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:10,784
But you're just a bunch of little

2717
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,808
Nobody

2718
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,624
I hope you enjoy it

2719
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:17,696
Because Humanity in Liberty is rising

2720
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:29,984
The Regis walk-in wrong second

2721
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,968
But you're just a bunch of little

2722
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:42,272
Nobody

2723
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,808
I hope you enjoy it

2724
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:46,880
Madison Rising

2725
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:50,976
2.0

2726
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:56,096
We are offering a deal we haven't offered in 6 months

2727
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:59,424
Alexapure Pro water

2728
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,056
Buck

2729
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:07,872
You

2730
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:08,640
F*** you

2731
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:11,968
I like how I like how he will give him

2732
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:14,016
100% correctness

2733
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:18,624
But his medication will only go .99 999

2734
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:21,952
He's going to he's going to protect against the salesmanship

2735
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:24,768
Personal views are always

2736
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:25,536
Is that correct

2737
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:29,888
He did a 17-minute goddamn rant about the CNN clips

2738
02:22:30,144 --> 02:22:36,288
He didn't actually play then went on at the enemies of your family the media is

2739
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,616
Haven't switched into salesman mode with no

2740
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,384
F******

2741
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:46,784
Such professionals

2742
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:48,320
He is the worst

2743
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:50,112
Dammit is an artist

2744
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:53,952
So amazing

2745
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:57,280
Today in the Museum of Contemporary Art

2746
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:58,560
And

2747
02:22:58,816 --> 02:23:00,352
There were so many pieces

2748
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:03,936
I was having this conversation

2749
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:06,240
Cuz somehow like I was in London

2750
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,008
For the past week

2751
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:08,544
Right

2752
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,592
Museums

2753
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:16,992
I think those are the first museums I've been to in like 20 years

2754
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:22,112
Tons of great museums in Chicago I would never go to the motor my f****** tourist

2755
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:25,952
So I went there and I was going to

2756
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:27,744
Looking at the

2757
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:28,512
These galleries going

2758
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:31,328
Every Gallery should have a

2759
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,096
Comic

2760
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:33,632
On their what

2761
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:34,912
Should be in this gallery

2762
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:35,680
Like

2763
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,472
Committee

2764
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,240
Waco standoff

2765
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:39,264
Yeah just

2766
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,824
Because every time I was there I would go through there and

2767
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:44,128
This is an amazing

2768
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:45,920
And then the next place I went

2769
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:52,320
Like somebody should just look at this and be like this is

2770
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:54,880
F*** you

2771
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:55,904
Alright

2772
02:23:58,976 --> 02:23:59,488
Is eggs

2773
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:00,768
Exactly what's going

2774
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:04,096
He is an amazing

2775
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:04,864
Artist

2776
02:24:05,376 --> 02:24:06,656
You cannot fight against

2777
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:09,984
In a

2778
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:10,752
A muse

2779
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,288
That transition

2780
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:14,592
Know that whole thing that will

2781
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:15,616
Is a

2782
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:17,408
Fix better performance

2783
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,944
Yeah because there's a

2784
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:22,272
Complete perfect through line there's a narrative through the whole thing

2785
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:25,856
Perfect like

2786
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:29,696
Personal victimization like CNN is Miss aligning me

2787
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:32,512
Replace this clip that doesn't have anything to do with him

2788
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:38,912
And he interrupted over and over again allows no context to happen doesn't actually engage with the material of what

2789
02:24:41,728 --> 02:24:46,080
Perfect

2790
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:52,480
They f****** hate you and then also a we got a special 20% off

2791
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:55,808
There were a couple of things that were like videos where is like

2792
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:57,344
We're going to show these 5 sec

2793
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:58,112
Eclipse

2794
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:59,136
Splicing together

2795
02:24:59,392 --> 02:24:59,904
But guess what

2796
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:02,976
Bulshit

2797
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:03,744
Art

2798
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,512
That

2799
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,304
F****** art

2800
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:09,120
And I think he just did something that

2801
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,984
URI

2802
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,032
I could never never

2803
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,568
Not a billion years

2804
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:18,592
Billion years

2805
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:20,640
Could we have the Bulls face

2806
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:25,760
Lying ability

2807
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:35,232
Bring up my patreon I feel self-conscious program

2808
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:42,400
Somebody asks like where can I find you on the internet

2809
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,704
Fan

2810
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,056
I think

2811
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:50,848
I think you're hitting a really

2812
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:53,152
What's up

2813
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:55,968
How you feel

2814
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:59,552
I also think

2815
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:02,112
It's important because

2816
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,136
We

2817
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:05,440
This Is War coming to with Alex

2818
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,488
Is that

2819
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,024
He is this

2820
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:11,840
Razee good performance artist

2821
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:12,608
Yeah

2822
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:16,192
And also one of the most dangerous forces

2823
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:17,728
In Media

2824
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:19,776
Right now

2825
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:24,384
And I don't think enough people

2826
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:26,944
If you want to if you want to call Trump's Tower

2827
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:28,224
He's the sorrow man

2828
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:29,248
Two trucks

2829
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:31,296
And that's where we lost

2830
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:34,880
Now we got a lot of nerve

2831
