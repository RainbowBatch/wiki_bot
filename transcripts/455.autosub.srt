00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need need money

5
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
College fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
About Alex

10
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,240
Vinegar for plants

11
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
No plant to plant watch plant

12
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,456
I've got a bunch of

13
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,552
Various vegetables that I'm growing new some things that are coming into

14
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Early-stage

15
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
I'm starting to

16
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
I've really been getting a charge out of his

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,792
You love the smell of turkey blow the smell of dirt

18
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,168
I enjoy it

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,496
Get my hands in there

20
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
Smells good

21
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Nature

22
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,456
And I picked up a very cheap copy of Mortal Kombat

23
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,784
No no

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,344
I think it's 11

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
I don't know but okay.

26
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
It's a cheap used one

27
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
11 is that new I mean compared to Mortal Kombat 2

28
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Is it the one that has

29
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
Has been there since like 3

30
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,568
Yeah something like that secret to

31
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,784
Going to the arcade

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
I preferred Killer Instinct

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,672
Killer Instinct they had more energy

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
I was

35
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Felt like

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
Well this violence might be a little over

37
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
I understand it's camp and I play together it's in first

38
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
You should try and play that one Shaolin Knights

39
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
Cooperative play

40
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Are you going to play

41
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Together

42
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Maybe that would work better for you

43
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Just like

44
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,712
This is what I've got okay

45
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,064
It's it's riveting stuff she was learning how to play it and I was on the edge of my seat

46
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Who's your who's your character Baraka

47
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
She knew I was playing with her

48
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
Call

49
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Stuff that has no application

50
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
Astonish

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480

Slow news day

75
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Not much going on Tuesday and Wednesday

76
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Nothing is happening on Alex

77
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Nothing

78
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967

83
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,567
I don't know if getting close to 6

84
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
Attacks with across the country towards protesters

85
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
Video that Alex saw where a black guy hit a white kid

86
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,183
+ 12

87
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,023
No no no.

88
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,167
All right I mean just general

89
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,775
Montreal little by little

90
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
Alright wizard

91
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
No no

92
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
Yes okay

93
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:20,575
Alright even though I'm really

94
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Cuz that's a good guess wizard

95
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,815
Business for the answer

96
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Yeah at some point

97
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,703
Most of the time that I was listening to show I had a really difficult time even

98
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Giving a s***

99
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Because so much of the time is just him saying the same things over and over and over and over and over and over and over

100
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Over again

101
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Petition to eat your kid

102
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
After globalist

103
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,831
They're going to take you into camps like it's over and over again

104
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
It's just obviously the intention of it

105
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
Repeat it over and over again to get to the point

106
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Iron Man

107
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
Fusion heart

108
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
Help me out nerd

109
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,527
Don't you know comics

110
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,391
My arc reactor

111
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
Driven in that seems like things that are different

112
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
And it was a desert for the

113
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Worth our time

114
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,775
He was just talking about

115
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,871
Disconnected Ranch how you should be scared

116
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Going down

117
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Is

118
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Tacular

119
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
But not a wizard very disappointed

120
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,607
These people literally want to beat your brains out

121
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,055
Yeah man all right should be a sensor like there's a lot of that

122
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
How are you

123
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
I don't know

124
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Might be a push

125
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
Going to kill everybody

126
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
News about

127
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,183
Desecration body in post

128
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
Open casket

129
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Certainly not

130
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,375
So mad about you

131
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
Don't worry we're starting here on the 7th

132
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,287
Complaining about China and he's complaining about the media man either all liars

133
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
We punished

134
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
So I should clarify

135
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
Alex is talking about how like there are like

136
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
I guess

137
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Promoted content on fortnite now

138
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
I don't know I don't know what the deal is

139
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
MCI 9 put some broadcast on fortnite

140
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
Okay and Alex's mad about that

141
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
So that's what he's talking about

142
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
Allowed

143
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
To be on your fortnite

144
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Alright buddy

145
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
You're old

146
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Command Jones tell me that white

147
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
When

148
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Evil globalist corporations of planets

149
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Ever seen

150
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Facebook

151
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Time Warner

152
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Muslim

153
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Silicon Valley

154
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Do to you

155
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
He said do your thing China

156
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
The one thing that I don't really care about it all whatever he's actually talking about about fortnite I have no idea

157
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
I couldn't get myself

158
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
I pulled this because I want to make a claim with categorically false

159
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,999
He claims that the media likes you would never talk about Muslims and Alex is completely making up

160
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
There's this article from June 19th 2020 titled quote what's happening in China's 211

161
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Million

162
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,007
That's an article Alex probably wants to pretend doesn't exist

163
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
And because it contains

164
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,759
Quote according to an excerpt from John Bolton's forthcoming book published

165
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,343
President

166
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
Go ahead

167
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Wichita

168
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
Exactly

169
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Has that article out

170
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
There's a big investigative piece

171
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
From February

172
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,543
Chinese government records reveal detailed surveillance reports on weaker families

173
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Application for Master 10

174
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Going back to January 21st

175
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,199
20

176
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,807
Weaker Refugee tells of death and fear inside China's xinjiang camps

177
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,415
You can go back to February 2nd 2018

178
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,743
Thousands of Muslims to China's political Edge

179
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Education camp

180
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,631
CNN has tons of Articles covering various aspects of the Chinese treatment of most

181
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Pierce

182
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,239
Which

183
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,823
What's important to understand with the intention of that lie is

184
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
Azan are saying what are you saying

185
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,223
He also probably has no idea whether or not to get undiscovered the story

186
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
The reality third coverage or non coverage of the week

187
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
The only thing that matters is image and feeling

188
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,767
I don't want the audience to just believe him and assume the CNN has in fact not touch

189
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
The story

190
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,911
And this is built on the feeling that he's created with the business of never criticized in China

191
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
The feeling is important

192
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
Because it helps Alex rationalize why everyone thinks Alex is a

193
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
It's not because he is in fact

194
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Actual piece of s*** and a liar

195
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Because everyone but Alex has a twist

196
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
China and they can't stand that he had the balls to

197
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Call them out

198
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Meanwhile if you just

199
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
Take a peek at what they're Brooke what reporting in

200
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
Is not afraid to cover this story

201
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
They might be afraid to cover it in the way Alex does

202
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Which I would say is irresponsible

203
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
Maybe trying to start a war

204
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
Is Alex agrees with Trump

205
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
Like literally like yeah go ahead and do those I'm fine with that they're Muslim don't care

206
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Which is a

207
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
Proviso that

208
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
We're at the point now where Iris

209
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Specs

210
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
The idea of Truth in Fahrenheit

211
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,671
But in regards to Trump if you say the worst thing a human can say

212
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
And say Trump said it

213
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Fine I believe you

214
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,559
Navigation is

215
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Campbell

216
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,495
But I'm not going to be suckered into just automatically believing someone because

217
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,895
Because it's so big that I would be

218
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Problem

219
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
Alex

220
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,039
It's really important for him to create

221
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
I guess a prop

222
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Or some sort of AA

223
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,487
To get out of having to explain why everyone doesn't respect him

224
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
And it must be because he has the

225
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
To call out China what everyone else is in there

226
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Answered my prayer

227
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,983
Divas audience even like

228
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Alex love to talk about Play-Doh

229
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,127
Is it just looked out of the cave they would see the

230
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
We just Googled it

231
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
They would not get Infowars articles

232
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,391
Up top of Google search results for what's going on in no

233
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
Literally every other news out

234
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
So if Alex is

235
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,351
Like he has to take a perverse

236
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,727
Them knowing that he's lying and being like

237
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
Old man house phone on a CDs

238
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,871
Call someone to Google Airport

239
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
There's an extra step

240
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
I don't know

241
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
SMS

242
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,063
So this next clip

243
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Because

244
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,671
Anyway

245
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
I'll never forget what an answer

246
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
20 years ago

247
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Empty Mason local Act

248
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
Activist

249
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
East Coast

250
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,543
Warmies at Lisa's the main group of the future this is what the time is really are

251
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,455
Infiltrated them he'd been there he he he went deep

252
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Michelle

253
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,879
The bad news

254
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
This is the first time I've ever heard Alex bring up the story about how he knew someone who had infiltrated

255
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
20 years ago in Austin or whatever

256
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
Which is something you might think would have come up in the past

257
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,543
I mean we never dealt with antifa before there have been no previous protests

258
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,943
Years past where he might have been screaming about antifa right I don't believe this story unless Alex in this other

259
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,271
Dude we're hanging out with Neo-Nazi skinheads at punk shows

260
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,927
There's very little likelihood otherwise they would have run is anyone claiming the banner of ants

261
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
Pecan

262
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,863
I have absolutely no idea who Steve Mason is to give you some sympathy

263
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,703
Alex

264
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
The only thing I can even find about him and looking into him a little bit is it his name appears of the participants of the Travis County Commission

265
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,199
A meeting from October 27th 1998

266
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
All right now then

267
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,599
He and Alex Jones along with Alex's cameraman Mike Hansen appear as private citizens who spoke at

268
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Possession but it's just a minute

269
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
So I don't know what they talked about it all

270
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,279
This is a meaningless piece of babbling in this guy's dead and now Alex

271
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,863
This is going to create a mythology guy

272
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,263
20 years ago he said in 20 years they're going to try and take over but a bing bada boom here we are

273
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
Society Steve Mason Society my friend

274
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Minot

275
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
I'll be funny if it is Jackie

276
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Jason's brother

277
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
So Alex brambles a whole bunch

278
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
About that video of the kid getting hit

279
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
It's the exact same thing he does all the time whenever there is some sort of video going around

280
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,767
He gets into some of his somebody is a vampire

281
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Stuff here

282
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Vampires

283
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
You're you know

284
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775
There are those in Alex's world

285
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Of course there are those who are Dracula's

286
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
We get to learn about a couple

287
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,271
Don't tell me

288
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Write down on this piece of paper

289
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
Where you think these people fall

290
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
I hear the three people that are going to be discussed

291
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Brian stelter

292
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Okay where do you think we're going here

293
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Okay alright

294
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Bill DeBlasio

295
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Gavin Newsom

296
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
These are the three

297
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,847
You have to decide Renfield or Dracula

298
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,991
Well I mean we don't even have the New Jersey governor who is obviously a Dracula

299
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
The country

300
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,135
Brainwashed the entire country into wearing masks or something

301
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,255
I mean we can extend this game out and actually play with like Nancy Pelosi

302
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Butter

303
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
Only three people that he specifies

304
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,983
I want to see I want it I want to see if you have good radar in terms of Alex's

305
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:55,359
Empire watch

306
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
But maybe

307
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
He has somehow

308
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
Twisted inverted this guy who's just

309
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Like a guy

310
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
And turned him into the evil Master you mean self

311
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
De Blasio

312
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
The only person

313
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,727
Nail disingenuous in Creepypasta

314
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Shelter

315
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
Is Governor Newsom even worse

316
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
I'm sorry

317
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
Get a photo of DeBlasio smiling

318
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Stand up

319
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Movie about job

320
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Blasio

321
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
Second Jordan you're changing one of your answers

322
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
Thank you

323
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Immediate

324
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,351
American Psycho 2

325
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Stepaside Christian Bale

326
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Nothing

327
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Michael Jackson

328
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
One down

329
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
Delta

330
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
Liver stuff

331
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
343 baby

332
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
Play always so happy

333
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Ukiah real good

334
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
He will don't you worry

335
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Come outside your house

336
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
He loves you

337
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Sorry

338
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
Let's just get right back to where we were

339
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
I'm impressed Jordan I really thought she could have gone either way I could have him

340
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,943
Stelter was kind of being picked up

341
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Affected

342
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
That's it

343
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:20,512
Who's going to be the Dracula

344
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,656
Yeah I feel like you probably

345
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,592
Like every other marriage

346
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
United States

347
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,320
Escalated by the governor of

348
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,904
New York the president everybody who lives in New York

349
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
He's already

350
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:54,560
At bat

351
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:01,728
Congratulations on my Jordans

352
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
We will

353
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
Keep you updated

354
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
So

355
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,224
You mentioned at the beginning of the show

356
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Factory bolsonaro test

357
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
Deposited for covid-19

358
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
Now there's an unfortunate side-effect

359
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
And one of them is Alex forgetting how to pronounce his name

360
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
Brazil's bottles

361
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
Cold

362
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
Coronavirus

363
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Deposit

364
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Santa Ana

365
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Texas

366
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,712
Don't want to shut down

367
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
Economy Inn

368
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
Azle

369
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,232
So that's why I fall tomorrow.

370
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,048
Great fun times Alex bananas

371
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,912
That is that is the call for revolution that he should be like

372
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
They're coming to kill bolsonaro

373
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
That's the cultural revolution

374
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,896
Seems like that should be Alex's at

375
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,552
He needs to heal a fly it into the trying to take out these nationalist

376
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
L a r a

377
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:28,256

Still like a Park please

00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Not much

388
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:03,584
You speak of on this entire episode there's so much feeling time this is

389
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
From the 7th

390
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,544
There is a pastor Rodney Howard Browne

391
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,384
I don't care I know you're asking me all about how you want your church to be open

392
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Course I understand

393
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Click

394
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Rogers on

395
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,112
The gear because he's pretending that he is an expert on Delane Maxwell

396
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,672
And all this stuff

397
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:35,328
So he was saying he should also go to jail no nevermind

398
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,424
He doesn't know them is just studied it

399
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Diabetes

400
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
Kennedy time in a minimum-security and Venom maximum

401
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
He has a new Theory to float

402
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Pretty cotton

403
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,248
And when is I first revealed

404
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Bill was going

405
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
The island

406
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
Because of his

407
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Affair with

408
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Just Wings

409
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
That that's

410
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
The connection

411
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
They were having a

412
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
Worried as beer

413
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Goshen New York

414
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
Andean and in the Virgin Islands

415
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,424
So he's done his research and he's found that Bill Clinton was having a

416
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,032
An affair with you later Maxwell but his research.

417
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
If you look into

418
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Cuz he knows her so well

419
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
Persei Jordan

420
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,280
Weather in El this is the conclusion that

421
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
Strikes me as difficult

422
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Come to only buy

423
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
It's a product of thinking

424
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Enchirito

425
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
I feel like

426
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
Larry Nichols should fall for the Raptors anytime

427
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Rodger stone is like

428
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
Somebody

429
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Larry Nichols just bald

430
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
I think I think Larry Nichols

431
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
Too much for a you might be Beyond he did make that brief reappearance talk about

432
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Adam Schiff

433
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,744
Egyptian sex party

434
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,888
Very hesitant

435
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,752
You threatened to Blackmail cowgirl

436
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
To talk about Egypt

437
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,736
Heather disappeared

438
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
So Alex

439
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
It comes in on the 8th

440
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
And

441
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
No

442
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
Sucks

443
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
Chose

444
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
Through mud

445
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
These last a few days

446
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
Something great

447
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
I don't think that it's the product of what he's

448
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Teasing

449
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,288
Do we start the episode with a little bit of a

450
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
Let me just tell you things are coming up right now

451
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Since I learned about this on Saturday

452
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
Saturday

453
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Did you

454
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,120
And then I make some phone calls and events happened and

455
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
Very decisive

456
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Are you

457
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
No

458
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
The best to talk about this right now

459
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
I know what's going on

460
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Daya

461
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
But is it good for me to announce this

462
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Because

463
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,536
Don't know why the White House has one else's

464
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,888
So should I try to get on the phone

465
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
Cuz I want to talk to the White House I can get

466
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Shot

467
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Topgolf

468
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
What's the problem

469
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
It's such a big issue I respect

470
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
People

471
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Thanks

472
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
To talk about what's going on some public knows

473
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,656
But no one knows about this yet

474
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Feel bad

475
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Not telling you

476
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:30,080
Shut up this one issue right now

477
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
To the point of

478
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
I really think about it should I

479
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
Information

480
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes

481
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Maybe I'll wait another day

482
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
Okay f*** you

483
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,792
At least for now

484
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,888
What a f****** throw a shoe at him

485
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,032
What is a Dragon Ball Z like right before the final fight episode the last episode

486
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
We got the fight is all set up and then right before the final fight there's no full episode

487
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,296
This guy we brought over here we brought over here

488
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,160
4 in the morning

489
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,720
Nothing just you said nothing

490
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,144
Alex doesn't I don't know what he's talking about

491
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
And guess what

492
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:34,592
A couple days from now he says something

493
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,712
What you was talking about what he was talking about

494
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Horrible

495
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,064
I won't say what it is but it is cheese a little bit of like what

496
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Football parkour

497
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
Some good news

498
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
Let's just say this

499
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
If you thought we were going

500
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Miles an hour

501
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
Collision Course with a lawnmower

502
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
We can. We were

503
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
Definitely

504
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:13,760
How is this any different than qanon

505
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:20,160
We're heading for our nation to tell you anything about it tomorrow

506
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,536
I got no answer my phone calls

507
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
You've been strung along 44

508
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
And none of the stuff is at

509
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Siri

510
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
This time

511
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,872
Tomorrow I'm going to an outside thing that totally happened that increase our speed from 200 miles to

512
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
2000 mph on a scale

513
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,904
Because I don't think that I'm about to play for you is what

514
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Talkin about

515
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,512
What it could be

516
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Attract rice

517
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
And it also

518
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
Could be the work of wither

519
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
You understand that

520
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,192
Physically the planets align

521
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
On Saturday

522
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,104
A very long time

523
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
21

524
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
61

525
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
140 years from now

526
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
Friends on

527
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,280
What the hell's going on we're all out there

528
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Somebody spiked

529
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
The beer

530
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Like this for

531
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Almost a month

532
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,624
Thomas Jefferson's idea Orlando Magic

533
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:59,488
Winning

534
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,584
Giant

535
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
Planetary alignments in a clan

536
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,472
The Romans would go to war

537
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Wow

538
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,856
Perfectly clear with you planetary alignment

539
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Physically impossible

540
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
There has never been and will never be a point when all the planets align based on their positioning and Orbison

541
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
It just doesn't happen

542
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,960
People talk about planetary alignment

543
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,824
There's a certain number of planets in the same section of the sky at assert

544
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
Time does Mike's

545
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,624
Flatline like they like they show you in it

546
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
Seeing of like a you know

547
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
Modeling do you have

548
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Nuance

549
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,776
Do like it would depending on where you are

550
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Any white

551
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
On July 4th

552
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,408
Last Saturday

553
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,736
Second of their three conjunction

554
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
This year

555
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,832
It's actually really big year for Jupiter and Pluto

556
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:35,232
I'm glad they're having fun opportunity in these three conjunctions where the bright light

557
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,816
Close enough to Pluto that allows people to telescopes

558
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
To be able to see Pluto

559
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,240
Better or whatever the f*** Alex Israel

560
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
Depends on who you ask

561
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,664
Yeah I'm one of those

562
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
When I was when I was coming up

563
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,320
Jealous

564
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:06,720
According to space.com

565
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,864
Jupiter and Saturn is a visual

566
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
Are you sure it doesn't yes

567
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,264
On July 4th the planets were perfectly and let you know they're made

568
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Being perfectly in line all right

569
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
Can't say that

570
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,224
Out loud and think that you're not the dumbest person

571
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
Because of the specifics

572
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:35,904
Particularly the it won't happen again until 2161

573
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
I come from a meme

574
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,024
God dammit

575
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,608
Going to die

576
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
Because mean people are living

577
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,496
Alex just awesome like Crystal shop

578
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,616
Oh my God I was out on the lake

579
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,016
Dimensional space

580
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,576
Straight line on a flat surface

581
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,368
They're all over the

582
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,184
Been everywhere we go all the way over

583
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
It's pretty fun

584
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
So Alex

585
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:22,496
This is the only like maybe one of the only things that I really was like alright got an episode

586
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
Release the Titan

587
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
I saw Disney's Hercules

588
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,640
When it happened

589
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,528
It really did a number on them

590
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Of course not

591
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,672
Corporate deals

592
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,720
We don't make decisions when the planets align

593
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,072
Also a literal state

594
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
Month or so

595
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
We're still going to be

596
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
Alignment

597
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
Closest alignment happened July 4th

598
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Only had a few beers

599
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
What

600
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
You were supposed to quit drinking

601
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
Whip and Nae Nae

602
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Sleep really good

603
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
Call my wife

604
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
I can't sleep

605
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Those are three-year-old daughter

606
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,104
In the hell is going on

607
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:38,528
Right now just reminds me of

608
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
The story is the protagonist

609
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
Finding a bunch of clippings

610
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:51,840
Really sensitive around the time with okay

611
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,680
Is a dreaming in really a I just

612
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,104
The stars are right for Cthulhu in the the great old ones come back

613
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
I'm going to put you some

614
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Something real quick

615
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
As far as having trouble

616
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Sleeping all right

617
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,296
And being a certain day

618
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
4th of July

619
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648
Add a known for

620
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
Exactly

621
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
That might be why

622
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah

623
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Sing this year

624
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
Be a lot of them

625
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
But it wasn't never bothered

626
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
And I'm one of the people who's the most bothered by noise

627
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:37,152
Absurd profoundly sensitive to noise never bothered me at all

628
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:41,248
Although now that I'm saying that to sound like if it did bother you

629
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,856
Something wrong with you

630
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,720
La we would have a very different story did you see the the overhead

631
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
Helicopter shop

632
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Oh s***

633
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,840
Overhead helicopter

634
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
Thrift Shop

635
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
And somebody even put the

636
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,192
Blade Runner music

637
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
Because it was

638
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Wall-to-wall just

639
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Splashing

640
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,568
Flashbang

641
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
It's really not

642
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,432
The fourth is pretty loud around this neighborhood

643
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Best Buy

644
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
A2B that alter bikes

645
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
Built into the blend of like

646
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
City North

647
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:22,464
The train is the distance doesn't bother me

648
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
Cars

649
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Somehow

650
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,864
Weird it's weird how the brain works that way I think because you're

651
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Prepared for

652
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
Maybe but it's so subconscious

653
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,264
It's not like I'm controlling filtering those things out

654
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Weird noises

655
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Sky

656
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,624
This is a conversation about

657
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,976
Flanigan's

658
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
And the Moon

659
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
I assume he

660
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
That's one thing

661
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
I'm not into astrology

662
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Astrology

663
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
Understand

664
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,896
Nope

665
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,968
During a full moon

666
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,760
Does not

667
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,320
But what's that doing

668
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:27,232
So it is interesting there's actually a study from 1984 in the British medical journal that looks at crime rates

669
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,048
From three towns between 1978 and 1980

670
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:34,400
Me too and I found triple bypass

671
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,960
Increase crime rate on Fulton

672
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Supposed

673
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Motorcycle

674
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
Other subsequent Studies have been in

675
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,896
Conclusive and some

676
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
Showing slight increases

677
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,832
I can't really explain that 1984 study other than to say that there may be another variable involved in the structure of the study

678
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,720
Didn't capture recycles

679
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,888
Contradictory studies that have happened

680
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
I like this is

681
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,984
Is nearly ending my relationship level argue

682
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,568
My partner really believes in the full moon

683
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
And I just had to accept

684
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:20,992
Well meaning of mostly water

685
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,928
That's actually in the discussion section of that article

686
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
British medical journal

687
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
I don't know I don't I think it's

688
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
You know

689
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:40,704
I understand where she's coming from and I also understand where the other side is based in

690
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
Rather studies not showing

691
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,336
I don't know that stuff though Alex is correct about the etymology

692
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
I spend a lot of time cleaning out what he and all of his guests

693
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:59,136
Makeup of words means

694
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Good job Alex

695
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
I mean like that's common knowledge but Oak

696
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,864
How far is Sbarro

697
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,448
So we know that Alex is probably

698
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
From which all Arts

699
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Is created

700
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Everett

701
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Only when the planets

702
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,920
Right everybody who's anybody

703
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,040
He's probably really been the thing that's inspired

704
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,368
Probably everything that you like but you just don't realize it

705
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
And here's one example.

706
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Infowars

707
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
The song

708
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
Then he wouldn't even

709
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
News weather in Santiago

710
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Pressure put on

711
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
And then

712
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
Patriots

713
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
Mainline

714
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
In the end

715
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
You lose every

716
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
Your whole civilization Society

717
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,359
So that song is The Pretender by the Foo Fighters inspired this song A little far-fetched

718
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
Considering that this is from their 2000

719
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Seven album

720
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,319
Dave Grohl has sent at least 1991 as a member of Nirvana

721
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:37,695
Like they get famous and won't come on my shows like

722
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
He was famous in 291

723
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,631
Come out like I was the first Fighters

724
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Late 90s

725
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,471
That was like wait baby 97

726
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,823
Cable Round Nirvana nevermind

727
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
It has become

728
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,407
Well he's only the drummer in the

729
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
Alright

730
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,479
Then when he became a frontman

731
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,039
5 years later

732
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,343
1071

733
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,159
Still coming up

734
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,999
Gigantic star already

735
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
Not just that but it also

736
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,143
Just released it comes on

737
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:22,239

Like Reddit

741
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:40,671
It's insane that someone that save us it would just apply for you

742
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:47,071
Tenacious B2 mainstream popularity for seemingly almost no reason

743
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,471
Destiny he was there he was also the devil in the

744
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:58,335
It is career he's been a vocal advocate for lgbtq rights and he support

745
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
Gun control

746
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
He's such a Democrat girl this guy

747
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,319
Play the song My Hero at the 2012 democratic National

748
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:14,719
Play about Barack Obama album companies

749
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,791
Do you remember where the repair toothpaste

Thanks Berry Gordy

752
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:31,615
Basically zero chance the Dave Grohl

753
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,455
You guys talked about it's like about political turbulence

754
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:40,319
Easy to see how Alex could hear it imagine that it's about himself

755
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
Which means it's about Alex

756
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Right

757
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
What the f***

758
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
So that was funny

759
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,511
There's no way that I believe any of this

760
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
Butts

761
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,327
Well let me tell you something about this movie

762
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Guardians of the

763
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,655
Almost almost

764
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
Star-Lord

765
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
So Alex

766
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
Empire

767
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
This next clip

768
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
I wish you were

769
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,919
Buyers for this

770
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:13,087
You trying to talk about how bad and accidentally said some things that are kind of positive about Hitler

771
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
Understand something

772
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,999
20 hours you'll never eat little piece of this summation

773
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,535
Document

774
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,143
This is not conjecture

775
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,239
There is a giant long-term

776
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
Planetary

777
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
Corporate directive

778
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Sure

779
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,919
Develop inside the British Empire starting in about

780
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
1850

781
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Sounds right

782
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Adopted

783
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
As a world government plan

784
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
At the end of World War II

785
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
Bargain place

786
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Hitler was not

787
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
He wanted control

788
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Differently

789
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,191
To strategically only wipe out certain

790
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Hitler did not want

791
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Person

792
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Lessons

793
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
Totally insane

794
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
People

795
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,207
This is a conversational really need that

796
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
You not crazy

797
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
Hitler

798
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,863
All the time yeah yeah

799
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
You get yourself into murky territory when

800
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,823
Like 8 because I know the point he wants to make and that is at the globalist want to kill everybody

801
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
Just from a numbers perspective

802
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
He's better

803
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,247
That's kind of what I was wanting to say

804
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
You don't need

805
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
To say that

806
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
You don't need to get into any of this

807
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:56,255
Nope it's not territory you can really walk very well like you're going to end up saying something

808
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,911
Even Alex

809
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
Junior most generous

810
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
Devil's

811
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
Position eventually gets

812
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
I'm not saying

813
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:17,247
Which is not the way you started

814
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:22,111
Qualify everything

815
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,415
Nah that's crazy

816
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
I mean look

817
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:31,071
Malaria's killed probably 25 billion people it didn't just choose the Jews right

818
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:36,191
It was not worse than malaria that's particularly distasteful about this

819
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Is one of these things

820
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,055
Write the other one is made up

821
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:45,663
Paranoid delusion

822
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:52,319
What Hitler was real he's not as bad as the things I scare myself

823
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
Well that does

824
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,135
Doesn't matter

825
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,415
Did you see Independence Day

826
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Hitler wasn't as bad as those alien

827
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,607
They were trying to kill everybody places all over every monument all over the world

828
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,911
Closest Monument

829
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,959
Yeah I got to say

830
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:14,591
For these reasons and almost certainly plenty of others

831
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,407
Also you're fired from guardians.

832
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:26,111
Alex Landers a man who is dead

833
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
Bobby Parkway

834
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
Ocean High School

835
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
Professor speaker

836
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
Everyone

837
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
So now Alex

838
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,951
Has a request like that for quite a while because Alex has told the story many times has

839
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,023
About dr. Irwin spear a number of times

840
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,447
Defaming

841
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,239
Saying that he was

842
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
Trying to recruit people

843
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,823
Into a eugenics

844
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Extermination

845
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Program

846
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,967
Family wants to sue Alex I don't see any reason why they wouldn't have standings

847
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,039
To do that

848
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
He's not a public figure

849
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,855
He was just a professor

850
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
At UT

851
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,671
This is outrageous

852
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,975
He's being accused of

853
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Go to like

854
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
It's he wants

855
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,375
To kill everybody not just that but it seems as though he's literally

856
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:47,007
Grooming young boys turn them into

857
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,151
It's a little bit of a problem

858
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,503
If I was related Irwin spear I would do it

859
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Totally

860
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
Respond

861
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
But

862
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,183
Might not want to for their own reasons I respect that

863
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,999
23andMe information dance

864
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
So

865
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,119
This makes Corpus kind of like an extension of

866
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
Alex's

867
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,983
The regular Trend that we've been seeing where escalating

868
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
Just a lot of like

869
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,663
You know hey might be time to kill and God will tell you what

870
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:32,063
Bolsonaro has covid-19 there man everybody has a cold

871
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Troubling

872
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,999
Escalade

873
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,095
This is all been set up to make you obsolete to dehumanize you

874
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
Suck the life out of you

875
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,239
Protect your family away from you

876
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
Lies

877
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
About human plan

878
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
Talking about

879
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,927
What we're going to do

880
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,303
We can't just sit here and do it

881
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,375
The leadership of the operation

882
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
Black

883
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,727
What does take one for the team mean

884
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,287
I think first and foremost

885
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
It means that Alex

886
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,223
For all his pretensions towards being a revolutionary or anything like that

887
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
Absolutely saying hey

888
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,551
Somebody else do this

889
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
Please

890
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,647
Yeah buddy

891
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:43,231
Kamikaze mission level

892
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,815
Has to show up right yeah be a hero

893
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,911
Alex Telefunken

894
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,983
This kind of thing is going line

895
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,519
The trend that we've been seeing

896
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,359
Over the past I like

897
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,919
That to me is such a

898
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,735
Like a further pushing of it because

899
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,807
The someone's going to have to take one for the team

900
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:12,927
Who's going to step up onto things are the sort of language

901
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
If you were trying to get some

902
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,535
Unhinge listener to be like

903
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,839
I'm the person who supposed to do that

904
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
I've been looking

905
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
Thruway to step up

906
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
I can be the tool of God's vengeance

907
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
I am loved

908
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
The team I will take one for the team

909
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,335
It seems to me like

910
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,151
It seems to me very difficult

911
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:37,247
As we go further and further this keeps happening it's getting more and more clear

912
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,599
More and more difficult for me to accept the proposition that he's not aware of what he's

913
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,391
Yeah totally that to me is because

914
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
I'm not saying I'm a hundred percent convinced

915
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
But I am becoming

916
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
Let's not

917
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,071
I would say

918
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
Here's what I

919
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
Rationally

920
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,191
I don't think he actually wants

921
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Anybody to

922
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,263
Emotionally

923
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,823
I think he wants more than anything for somebody to

924
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Carryout

925
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
His vicarious Justice

926
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:11,295
Yeah I like that that feeling like I'm so angry all the time and I'm impotent about it and I can't do anything

927
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:17,695
I would like a proxy to go visit my

928
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Vengeance upon

929
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,047
You may be right I mean I don't know I don't know what the

930
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,143
Distinction between emotional and rational is

931
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,191
He doesn't want an actual Revolution

932
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
We can't park

933
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
You and I

934
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
Sitting here

935
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,127
We have to go on is like what

936
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,967
Represents on the show and how he carries himself

937
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,759
I mean yeah I would

938
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,879
His rational mind is like

939
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,047
Actually

940
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
People to be hurt

941
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,655
Probably in the same way

942
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,471
Putting out I don't know but it's getting

943
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,287
It's getting really troubling

944
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
About that

945
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
What he just did

946
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,383
Described

947
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
I would like

948
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
Starting now

949
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
For a group

950
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
People

951
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
2

952
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,063
Plan how to commit murder

953
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
That is a crime

954
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,415
That's conspiracy

955
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
To commit murder

956
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,815
Inspire in the conspiracy involved in it

957
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,887
I would announce my plan to commit a massive

958
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,727
Scribes that's why you're in the clear

959
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,519
So

960
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,567
Calls

961
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Calls

962
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,919
First guy to know

963
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,199
Real that's request

964
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
Alex's answer is dumb

965
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:53,183
What do you think about Kanye West do you think that he's serious do you think that it's all sort of like a

966
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,279
Facade he saw his wife and he saw her dad

967
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,167
Want to kill all the black people

968
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,471
Wildman

969
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,335
It doesn't mean he's not

970
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,455
But he wants to be with God and he wants me to

971
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,599
Does that mean

972
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
Wow

973
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
She's like to like Rosa for that

974
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
Assure

975
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
Good songs about

976
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
Booty booty

977
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,127
God bless you I appreciate your

978
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,407
Yeah man lot of fun

979
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,479
There's so much similarity between

980
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,295
Kanye West in 2 Live Crew

981
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,855
Is he preemptive

982
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,415
Licking Conyers boots

983
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:05,375
That what he was just doing

984
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,935
Would like to be stop on commercial

985
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
Everybody needs

986
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
Stop paying attention to this nonsense

987
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
I mean

988
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
It just

989
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
Highlights Alex's lack of serious

990
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
Whatever

991
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,807
This is interesting we got a caller

992
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Spirituality

993
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
Apparently

994
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
Face mask

995
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,719
Bad for spirits

996
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,767
Because they

997
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:37,631
Change your breathing pattern on your breathing pattern getting more shallow

998
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,167
Has some negative effects

999
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,751
Spirit that can breathe it has

1000
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,311
It doesn't read like the Drone and stuff

1001
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Leslie not a product

1002
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,639
All colors of Sharon

1003
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,735
And they're driving the breathing algorithm into a shallow

1004
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,527
Breathing algorithm toso we manifest

1005
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
Shallow place

1006
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
I don't know every emotion

1007
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
The breathing

1008
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,463
Pattern that goes with it

1009
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
You definitely

1010
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
And you know

1011
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:14,239
I think it's more about stopping you from screaming muffling a scream it's just typically why people put their head

1012
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,567
It's not usually to keep the Holy Ghost

1013
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:22,687
No it's not to alter your breathing patterns

1014
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,247
With the most high by holding my

1015
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:31,647
Just listen to that guy talk about like breathing patterns

1016
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
I feel like I've heard this stuff

1017
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
And I know I have

1018
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,583
Because it's all just new AG nonsense with getting recycled

1019
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:45,215
And this guy's call is almost entirely just rehashing of new-age s***

1020
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,519
That I remember from like a f****** decade ago

1021
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,311
Where we're going into Matt

1022
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,591
Planetary

1023
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,663
Shift like you said there's going to be a big one on December 21st

1024
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
That's what they say

1025
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,759
No that's the

1026
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
The true beginning in that scenario age

1027
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
And I feel like that

1028
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
The Breath of God

1029
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,439
Spirit it'll be more energy in the air and more clarity

1030
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,327
And where

1031
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,935
And still Days Later can't sleep

1032
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,799
Can you feel it

1033
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,711
You just got sunstroke or something like

1034
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:34,623
You just got sun poisoning you just forgot to put sunscreen on

1035
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:42,815
This is buying a calendar stuff all over again

1036
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,911
Inverted

1037
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:54,847
Yeah from seeing some of these accounts.

1038
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,455
Densities and dimensions

1039
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,735
Transcendence

1040
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:05,599
This is all the same stuff it's just all I told his being recycled from

1041
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
All of these logs

1042
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
They were doing anyways bulshit

1043
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
4 years it's all the same

1044
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
It's all exactly

1045
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,559
Is it a real bummer

1046
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,095
Because I'm not least of which because

1047
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,167
Especially after going through Carrie Cassidy's bulshit where it's

1048
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,191
Like always scratching

1049
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,471
Space Weirdo And they hate

1050
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,055
The Jews like now we are seeing all these new age weirdos

1051
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:31,455
You like Crystal 10 years ago and now you also

1052
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,271
Kill the Jews what is going on here

1053
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:40,159
Exactly what the phenomenon has something to do with

1054
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:40,927
Eroding

1055
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Critical thinking

1056
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
Skills-based around

1057
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Various

1058
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,887
I don't know how I would put it but

1059
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,655
Just like

1060
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:55,007
Communities that are based on

1061
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,567
Acceptance of nonsense

1062
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Divorce

1063
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Susceptible you are to

1064
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
The coop

1065
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,407
So you could

1066
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:05,759
Stay in a crystal Community for a really long time right

1067
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,527
And because

1068
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
Maybe you and

1069
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Your friends just like Crystal

1070
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,903
And maybe you meditate

1071
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,463
Some

1072
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,791
The meditation to the crystals with a really good time

1073
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
Now let's assume that somebody

1074
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
Is Buckhead

1075
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:26,239
Comes into your Crystal

1076
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,287
Ideas

1077
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,311
Like

1078
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,895
Yeah I don't know I don't even know exactly

1079
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:38,527
I think people were vulnerable in those

1080
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,087
And I think that's why you see that less

1081
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:44,415
Less than just like it's inevitable that they will have it

1082
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,231
I think really attractive

1083
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,351
Personal experience potential stuff is always been really fast

1084
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,495
You can find yourself gravitating

1085
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,543
And they become

1086
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Just large

1087
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,895
Collections of people who are Sitting Ducks

1088
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,943
For very talented

1089
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,527
Radical eisers

1090
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
Go from being a

1091
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,135
Community to being a mob and

1092
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,183
It can't happen

1093
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
That's a bummer

1094
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,767
But

1095
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,839
Is really interesting about this

1096
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Alex

1097
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:28,959
Become more into that stuff to he's talking about

1098
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,775
Tripping his balls out because of the planets align

1099
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
Liberals getting high

1100
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
Very weird

1101
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,967
Service next caller also had a prophetic dream about Alex

1102
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,271
She was getting real weird

1103
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,855
Episode

1104
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Pretty normal

1105
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:52,767
Justin vegetating like in 2013

1106
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
Alex thanks for taking my call

1107
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Thank you sir

1108
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,519
Minister for about 8 years and

1109
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,127
Two-and-a-half years ago I had a prophetic dream about you

1110
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,175
The color

1111
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,223
Imagery

1112
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,807
And what not not going to share it on here but I'm going to share what was the

1113
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,647
By the way I had a discussion with Tim fruge this morning about

1114
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,487
He said it's like cartoon

1115
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Technicolor

1116
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
We we

1117
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,399
A bunch of his wife is having

1118
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Vivid

1119
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
Technicolor dream

1120
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,359
It was like that

1121
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
Sifo-Dyas

1122
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
This was two-and-a-half years ago

1123
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:47,295
Vivid dream about Alex 6 years into listening to him pretty regularly

1124
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,319
That makes sense

1125
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:53,183
Around screaming a lot of sensational

1126
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,583
Maybe some of that would have seeped into your brain

1127
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:05,727
Anyway he doesn't want to talk about what the dream was

1128
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
It was about

1129
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
That good

1130
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,663
What you say

1131
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Really profound

1132
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,735
Call Dodge rings in my life

1133
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,527
The last one I had

1134
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Ball tell you

1135
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,559
I'm a truck driver sitting in a truck I was sitting in the past

1136
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
Your side

1137
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887
I looked I was

1138
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
I kind of woke up

1139
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
The truck was going down the road

1140
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,543
I looked over because it was just like I came to

1141
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
There is nobody driving

1142
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
The wheel and a handle

1143
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
The door

1144
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:52,319
Cruise control was on we're going super fast

1145
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:57,695
And I looked and it was you and you were you had your hand on the door and hand on the wheel but your body was out like

1146
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
Out of the truck

1147
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,767
And you were staring at the same time

1148
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,047
And it was like

1149
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,863
Look super dangerous I reach over grab your wrist

1150
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
I pulled you into the truck

1151
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
And then you grab the wheel

1152
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,727
And then

1153
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
And that I sent you

1154
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
You know

1155
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
We're on the journey

1156
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,359
They're still

1157
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,383
We're on the journey

1158
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
Do we still have a long ways

1159
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
To go

1160
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
Driving to

1161
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Really dangerous dice

1162
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,063
50 * like road conditions

1163
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:36,351
I think Alex has eaten otherwise there's no reason

1164
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,167
Yeah and then I grabbed your arm at 2:30

1165
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:45,823
Oh man I can't believe we reached the point where April Wars has become tell me your dream

1166
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,711
Mad about me

1167
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,247
Closest friends

1168
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,551
Let alone a stranger

1169
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,879
Calling into a shaking this is Prosthetics

1170
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,159
What is the prophecy

1171
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,487
Burlington

1172
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
Anyway

1173
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
And that's when I

1174
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,399
Yeah we all need to come together

1175
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,263
I don't know if I agree

1176
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,591
Here is what that guy has to say about his own dream

1177
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,127
I'll tell you what was

1178
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,431
Was going to meet us to been my life's work

1179
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:24,991
There's a crypt

1180
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:25,759
Tonight

1181
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
That in defeat the globalist

1182
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,623
And it was done 2000 years ago with the cross

1183
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,743
And what the world is really experiencing now is to be getting birth pains

1184
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,023
Reboot

1185
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
The revelation of Jesus Christ

1186
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:45,471
At this point I was really worried that he was going to say Alex you need to be crucified

1187
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Show me really is

1188
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,711
The perversion of a twisted

1189
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,015
Religious stuff

1190
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
It's going to fall off

1191
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
We're just going to see

1192
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,367
Christ plainly for who he is

1193
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
That's fine just declare out to

1194
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
The audience today

1195
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
God loves you

1196
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,535
And every single time you missed the mark

1197
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
What's 10 means

1198
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
Dealt with

1199
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
At the Cross of Christ

1200
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Covenant with his father

1201
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
And

1202
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Because of love

1203
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
Because we are loved

1204
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,359
He made a way he is

1205
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
The door

1206
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,919
Through this and into

1207
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,479
The real reality bless you brother

1208
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,783
Redhead

1209
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,391
Housewise defecate every 425

1210
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,671
I got cut off by the bank

1211
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Very pretty

1212
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,767
I don't think Alex is doing good time management

1213
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,911
I mean I got is defecated on the phone for 45 minutes

1214
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,983
Honestly this show is so boring

1215
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
But for the most part

1216
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
Constant repetition

1217
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,895
Drumbeat these are people these people are evil they want your kids are going to kill you

1218
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
Eva Eva Eva

1219
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,991
It's over and over and over again

1220
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
And then

1221
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,367
Insanely over-the-top extreme religion

1222
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,415
And March towards viola

1223
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:11,231
You got going on

1224
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
On the regular

1225
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,535
Infowars

1226
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,607
And these days are pretty likely these last couple days

1227
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
I've been

1228
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
Pretty much just that

1229
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
Bandits

1230
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:25,055
It's not that interesting when Alex isn't talking about like how the planets aligned

1231
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,591
You got high on a boat

1232
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,431
Or whatever

1233
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Is one thing that's funny

1234
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,527
And then him thinking that it had some kind of a mystical

1235
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Is

1236
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,927
Is fun but the rest of this is not good

1237
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
I'm going to pinch you

1238
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
Okay

1239
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
Okay

1240
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,631
Okay so Alex gets another call

1241
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,167
And this guy

1242
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,191
Ask Howard

1243
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,751
Question

1244
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,543
Albuquerque not what's your name

1245
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,847
It is

1246
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,687
We talked about on the show

1247
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,247
Alex claimed there's a council of twelve

1248
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,551
Identify

1249
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,111
Lava Council of twelve

1250
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:14,719
This guy is like

1251
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Can you get a really a

1252
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,887
On one of your shows

1253
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
Bill Gates

1254
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
12

1255
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,055
Defiance

1256
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,175
Alex hang up on her

1257
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,159
Stuffing exactly

1258
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,767
Other people on the council or is it

1259
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,839

1260
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,631
Some research that that Bill Gates

1261
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,191
Copy political rotate in and out of David Rock

1262
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
Cellar

1263
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
Was

1264
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,031
On it for a while

1265
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
I can tell you that job

1266
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,407
There's two Rothschilds on it

1267
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
Been Told

1268
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
One of them is that

1269
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
Over representers

1270
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:25,887
The name of to Rothschild

1271
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,959
In 2017

01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:35,871
Hey Alex is really interesting clearly made up

1273
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:40,223
Budget European

1274
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
That is

1275
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:46,111
He's got cold on in class and he was like I do not know how a

1276
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,487
Conceivably the 12 people who ruled Humana

1277
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
It's not a small.

1278
01:09:54,815 --> 01:10:00,959
If they rotate in and out

1279
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
Very willingly

1280
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:07,103
We give up a seat on that no absolute

1281
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
There is always

1282
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:15,551
They're okay if you don't deep freezer

1283
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,087
This is entirely made

1284
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:22,207
Freezer

1285
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,999
Thank you that I've struggled with

1286
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
Here's what happen

1287
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,095
Every civilization

1288
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
Has the Council of twelve

1289
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,983
Sure and then the council of twelve when the civilizations meet

1290
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,263
To fight each other to the death

1291
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,823
Okay and whatever 12

1292
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
The 24

1293
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Become the new 12

1294
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:46,271
Okay

1295
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,063
There's only one Council of twelve

1296
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,623
Until we meet

1297
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,927
Exile Raptors

1298
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:57,023
And that will happen when all 12 planets align

1299
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,863
Planet XIII is the one nobody

1300
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,911
David

01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,591
Concrete a 48 imaginary

Group of 12 people claimed from the planet in

01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:22,623
Rothschild

1305
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,439
Just saying it's unofficial

1306
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,719

Because

Everything I know of Alex's career

1313
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,015
He presents himself to be

1314
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,319
You should not disagree with

1315
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
Anything

1316
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Joe Biden

1317
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,415
Alright the video just one live

1318
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:01,535
Dot-coms on a hot mic

Columbus organization

1320
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,983
He says the police have become the enemy but don't worry he'll take them over and then they'll be

1321
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,287
They'll be good again

1322
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,847
Abolish the suburbs and rural areas

1323
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,175
Single-family home racist

1324
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,295
Don't have nuclear family

1325
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,879
So horrible.

1326
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,975
Get all the records and find out what they're doing that's what revelstok

1327
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:36,095
The stop-and-frisk in Camden New York City

1328
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:40,191
The federal government has right to Glenn instead change the stomach lie

1329
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,471
What's going on

1330
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,543
There's a whole range of things that we can do

1331
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,359
The idea of no-knock warrants for

1332
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,175
Drug cases it's bizarre we don't need that

1333
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,503
Egyptian Vice trouble that's how Brianna was chill

1334
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:58,367
Need for fundamental change

1335
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:03,487
People have access to the records of police when they have misconduct charges against them

1336
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
To be able to know

1337
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,399
Should be held in

1338
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:13,215
That information will have to be made available

1339
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
2

1340
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
Justice department

1341
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,799
Handheld in a file

1342
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
So you be able to track

1343
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,551
The last thing you need is my Farmer in Humvee coming into a neighborhood just like the military

1344
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,623
I don't know anybody to become the enemies are supposed to be

1345
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:39,583
Alex based on everything in Alex's career

1346
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
Yes

1347
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,703
You should not have no knock warrants for drug offenses

1348
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,519
That end of escalating into people's deaths

1349
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,847
Alex should be 100% on board with Biden saying that

1350
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,663
He's talking about the militarization of police

1351
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
And how

1352
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:57,759
Like negative and toxic

1353
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,063
Alex should a hundred percent be on board with that

1354
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,391
The only thing that I think you could take a new ones position on

1355
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,719
Is whether or not the federal government should keep the records

1356
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
Of the

1357
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,327
Malfeasance

1358
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,143
Complaints and abuse

1359
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:17,471
Charges against

1360
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,567
Like Alex could say no the state should keep that as opposed to

1361
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:26,175
The Department of Justice the old place

1362
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,247
Believe or has Believe throughout the

1363
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,551
The Lion's Share of his career

1364
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,855
That the police

1365
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,391
Reindeer

1366
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,719
So now Alex is fully transformed

1367
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
Hearing positions

1368
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
He himself would have said

1369
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
New no-knock

1370
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,375
Transfer drug sheet is unacceptable

1371
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Tanks

1372
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,215
Bitter coming into neighborhood that's

1373
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
Really shouldn't happen

1374
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:54,079
Those are things that would be right on the Alex Jones Show in the past

1375
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,383
Now he's like this is evil globe

1376
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,687
Yes those very much

1377
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:03,039
Hey I don't think officer Darren should have a

1378
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:09,439
F****** tank so that Alex is a gas in favor of militarized police absolute

1379
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,863
Take down everybody's doing what is he saying he's saying that if there is an Administration that he died

1380
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
Doesn't like

1381
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:21,471
He hopes that they have the power to at any point in time

1382
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,519
Decide that gun laws should be in

1383
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,567
Enacted and then with a no-knock warrant

1384
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
Found its home

1385
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:31,711
And break in and kill him that is what he was like this is so weird to me because

1386
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:35,807
He's falling into the Trap that he's falling into or whatever

1387
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,831
Like is just

1388
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,111
Oppositional defiance

1389
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,159
Yeah like you mad at this

1390
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:43,999
Guy who doesn't like you besides not supposed to be

1391
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:50,399
Sing things

1392
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,959
No interest

1393
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,727
Intra

1394
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,263
Sucks

1395
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:58,335
Now if you were to come out and say

1396
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,919
People should be freed who have drug conviction

1397
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943
That I would say

1398
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
You are right

1399
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,015
Still go fuc yourself

1400
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
But you're right

1401
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
I hope

1402
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,111
Accidentally walk into a fire but

1403
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:14,207
I'll give it ya

1404
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,743
Heath

1405
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,791
Him being in office

1406
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,095
Override

1407
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:24,447
My beliefs Vicky balloon

1408
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,287
I don't understand how Alex can't like have the presence of mind to be like

1409
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:31,103
F****** hate Joe Biden sucks I don't want him to win

1410
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,431
Yeah absolutely no-knock warrant so ridiculous there's no reason

1411
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,759
There's no acceptable argument for why we should be doing that

1412
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,087
For suspected drug violations

1413
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,111
The police are out again

1414
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,975
Control I don't agree with Biden I hope he loses embarrassingly in the next election

1415
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,511
But yes please don't

1416
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:53,631
How can you not get to that point how is he so far gone that like

1417
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,447
Nothing is nothing is real other than

1418
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,519
I think personally I think it is

1419
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,335
Due in large part probably

1420
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,103
Toomics

1421
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:03,871
McConnell

1422
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
By that

1423
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
That transformation really

1424
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,271
Of the entire Republican Party

1425
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
From

1426
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:14,879
Even any semblance of ideas or governance to just

1427
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
When

1428
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
Just want to win

1429
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:22,815
That's all we want I don't care what policies we enact as long as they're horrible and awful

1430
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
Will f*** everything up

1431
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,887
As long as we win

1432
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,703
Because Alex thinks he doesn't like

1433
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,383
Well he thinks he hates him because McConnell is f****** good at cheating

1434
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,711
Like I don't know I don't know what to tell you I think it's because he predates

1435
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,063
The Tea Party

1436
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,855
121 associated with that like

1437
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,135
Like somebody's other

1438
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,439
Yahoo's yeah cuz it doesn't matter about any

1439
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,767
It's just I can't give by

1440
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,535
A

1441
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,839
Greatest him it seems like

1442
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,911
It's not a window if you say you agree with B

1443
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,191
That means he won

1444
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,495
That means he beat Trump

1445
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,567
That's what you're saying you're saying that I agree with Biden

1446
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
Over Trump

1447
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,127
That means B one

1448
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,407
Cannot do it

1449
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:15,807
You might be right in thinking but I'm getting a little overwhelmed

1450
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Prospect

1451
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:20,671
Because that's really f***** up

1452
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Doesn't seem to bother him

1453
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,815
Except for you.

1454
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,607
He had a

1455
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,935
F****** Transcendent experience on a boat that the planets align

1456
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,239
Falling apart that is why you don't like

1457
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,311
I don't know man it's it's

1458
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:41,151
It's really it's really strange to me I mean like one of the things that I think we've tracked

1459
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:41,919
A ton

1460
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,711
You know just

1461
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,247
Scattershot as it comes up

1462
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,343
Is oldies a complete rejection of his past

1463
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,647
Things that seems like the most import

1464
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,719
And that's so strange

1465
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,511
To me you'd like how easy it is

1466
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,535
For him to

1467
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,815
Spend

1468
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,935
20 years making a career that is based on

1469
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,471
Fears of the police state

1470
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,799
Fears of militarization of police

1471
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,103
Yelling about like things like Jade helm

1472
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,895
And all this stuff and Bandit

1473
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,687
Allow yourself to

1474
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Critique

1475
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,783
Joe Biden like this about him saying things that you

1476
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,831
Three-way or you're supposed to agree with

1477
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,671
The depressant portrait of somebody who

1478
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,719
Who's just not Tethered to any

1479
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,559
He's not or maybe was but isn't anymore there's nothing like a dozen

1480
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,863
Don't seem like anything except guns racism

1481
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,631
Annex

1482
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
Extremist

1483
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
Generally means anything to them

1484
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,727
Yeah cuz even is answer

1485
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Police Dept

1486
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,359
It's not like just as simple as there's a black man in the well

1487
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,991
Yeah I mean I imagine now it's as simple as there's black people in the street

1488
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,575
Yeah you know that doesn't seem hard but they're here.

1489
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:59,487
Yeah I mean the police state stuff what does go back to like 9/11 in

1490
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,279
Totally related to Obama

1491
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:07,167
I don't know I don't know if we have a concrete answer on this but I will say it's the

1492
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:11,519
It's a bummer

1493
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,055
I'm really kind of

1494
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
Disappointed in this week

1495
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,344
The lifestyle

1496
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,672
To make sense of this week be kind of like a real

1497
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:35,328
Do nothing kind of. Of time recovering from planets aligning
